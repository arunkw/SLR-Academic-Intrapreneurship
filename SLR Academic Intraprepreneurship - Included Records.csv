This has meant that universities now have to become more entrepreneurial in offerings, outlook and culture. However, a core actor in this process who is often overlooked is the academic. The ability of an academic to effectively transfer knowledge to industry is key to universities achieving their entrepreneurial mission and ambition. This paper explores the changing roles of academics to identify key distinctions between entrepreneurial academics and academic entrepreneurs. This is done through a systematic literature review spanning 25 years drawing on selected high impact journals in innovation, entrepreneurship and higher education studies. We categorise the types of activity that academics typically engage in and identify the motivations and challenges they face. From this, we identify two types of academics, the entrepreneurial academic and academic entrepreneur. We posit that there is a need for both types of academics to contribute to the success of the entrepreneurial university and conclude by outlining some avenues for future research.

Therefore, this study aimed to gain a deep understanding of the entrepreneurial university. The study was designed with a mixed-method approach in which quantitative and qualitative methods were used together. In the quantitative part of the mixed-method research, a systematic literature review of the entrepreneurial university concept was done and based on the results of the literature search obtained by quantitative methods, general concepts and categories and their relations with the contexts were revealed. In the qualitative part of the mixed-method research, in order to explain the entrepreneurial university understanding, semi-structured interviews were conducted with academicians in universities. According to the findings, it was found that conceptualization was very important to understand the entrepreneurial university. The university was considered as an institution that serves students and companies via some channels, such as research reports, an academic publication, or a patent received at the end of a project. As the entrepreneurial university paradigm is being studied by various institutions in the world, this study contributes to the literature both as a theoretical study and as a study that reveal the concepts of the entrepreneurial university. By providing a conceptual framework, the research will contribute to the literature as a theoretical study by aiming to explain the service systems (universities, government, firms) based on the exchange of skills and the creation of common value in the knowledge-based society on the entrepreneurial university paradigm, which is extremely popular in the world. Fındings from the systematic literature review and interviews with academicians were analysed comparatively, and a conceptual framework that evaluates the concepts and variables of the entrepreneurial university with a holistic view is presented. © 2022 by the authors.",2022

Job satisfaction as a moderating factor between outcome expectations and entrepreneurial intention among academics",International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal,,,10.1007/s11365-021-00744-8,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139030197,"Both psychological and entrepreneurship research have highlighted the pivotal role of job satisfaction in the process of entrepreneurial career decisions. In support of this, mounting evidence point to inter-relationships between entrepreneurial intention, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Prior research operationalized entrepreneurial careers as an escape from poor work environments; thus, there is a lack of understanding regarding how job-satisfaction can trigger entrepreneurship within and related to the environment of universities. This study, draws on Social Cognitive Career Theory and the concept of entrepreneurial intention, to address whether the role of job satisfaction is a moderating factor between outcome expectations and entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, we examine to what extent (I) entrepreneurial intention and (II) spin-off intention are determined by certain outcome expectations and perceived behavioral control. To address these questions this study examined academic researchers in specialized and non-technical fields and builds on a survey of 593 academic researchers at Swiss Universities of Applied Science. The results showed that outcome expectations are a significant predictor for entrepreneurial intentions, in general, and spin-off intentions, in particular. A multi-group analysis corroborated that job satisfaction operates as a motivational factor in entrepreneurial transition and interactions with entrepreneurial outcome expectations. In conclusion, the concept of job satisfaction and Social Cognitive Career Theory were powerful constructs to better the understand the process of entrepreneurial career decisions by academic researchers.",2021

Drawing from the literature on non–IP-based academic entrepreneurship and gender disparities in science, this study used the “pair-matched” technique to isolate 406 female and male academics in business schools (203 of each gender from a sample of 729 academics) who share common characteristics regarding academic position, subdisciplinary affiliation, and experience. The study confirms that a comparison of female and noncomparable male academics could lead to an unfair judgement of female academics’ performance. However, the results show that even compared to comparable men, women are less involved in remunerated consultations, generate a smaller proportion of their revenue from consultations and are less engaged in the creation of consultancy companies. In addition, the study allows us to quantify a leaky pipeline of both genders involved in informal academic entrepreneurship and to identify four paths, from progressive to nonprogressive. Most female academics follow a progressive entrepreneurial path but often struggle to move from nonremunerated to remunerated entrepreneurial engagements. The study concludes with implications for university administrators on knowledge transfer and gender inequality.",2022

Faculty entrepreneurial orientation will be assessed at three levels, i.e., innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactivity. For this purpose, we surveyed a sample of 291 faculty from Kuwaiti colleges and universities. The core constructs were operationalized using scales validated in previous studies. The hypothesized relationships were tested using the structural equation modeling method. Our findings indicate that while female faculty are more proactive than men, males are innovative and risk-takers to some extent. Moreover, Ph.D. holders are more proactive and innovative than Master’s degree holders. The relationship between specialization and both innovativeness and risk-taking is significant only for business, but not for engineering. Teaching experience is more positively correlated with faculty proactivity. The number of scientific publications is negatively associated with faculty risk-taking propensity. Additionally, faculty who cumulated significant industry experience are proactive in identifying long-term opportunities and threats for their institutions. Having earned professional certifications is positively related to some aspects of innovativeness and proactivity. Finally, faculty who received their latest degree from a non-accredited institution are more active in realizing ideas at work.",2022

Therefore, it is particularly important to give attention to the individual psychological mechanism factors at play in the process of teachers in higher education academic entrepreneurship. The purpose of this study is to identify individual psychological capital and role conflict issues among university teachers in China. To accomplish this aim, we investigated the emergence of positive academic entrepreneurial intents, continued through the process of academic entrepreneurship, and clarified the impact of psychological capital and role conflict on entrepreneurial intent. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we constructed a research model from the perspective of entrepreneurial intent prior to entrepreneurial action. We established a cohort of teachers in 17 higher education institutions (<i>N</i> = 525) in southern China, with psychological capital and role conflict as the prior independent variables and the teachers' academic entrepreneurial intent as the dependent variable. Using quantitative analysis, SPSS 22.0, and AMOS 23.0, we conducted reliability and validity tests, correlation analysis, and structural equation models on the collected data. We reached the following conclusions: (1) psychological capital has a positive effect on attitudes toward academic entrepreneurship; (2) psychological capital has a positive effect on perceived behavioral control; (3) role conflict has a negative effect on perceived behavioral control; (4) academic entrepreneurial attitudes have a positive effect on academic entrepreneurial intent; (5) perceived behavioral control has a positive effect on academic entrepreneurial intent; (6) subjective norms have a positive effect on academic entrepreneurial intent.

This paper aims to examine how academic intrapreneurs perceive and respond to organizational factors set by departments, faculties, schools, and university boards that influence knowledge transfer, the initiation of an internal project, and the collaboration with societal stakeholders. We employ an embedded case study approach to examine the role of perceived control and influence within the internal work environment of a knowledge commercialization process within the DiabetesStation, a healthcare innovation at the Erasmus Medical Center (MC), a university hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We used a semi-structured interview strategy and analyzed 12 individual respondent interviews. The results show that the relationship between academics and the Knowledge Commercialization Process within the DS at Erasmus MC was influenced by six factors (i.e., external collaboration, product quality, time availability, external financing, internal financing, and rewards and reinforcement). Our study highlights that the perception of- the academic intrapreneur’s control and influence seems to impact effectively transferring academic knowledge from academic institutions to the private sector for economic and societal benefit. The research results highlight three controllable areas of an academic institution’s internal work environment that can enhance the relationship between knowledge valorization and academic intrapreneurship—time availability, rewards and reinforcement, and internal financing.",2022

This study attempts to explore the mechanism of how academic entrepreneurial intention is shaped, with job-related negative elements as push factors, and entrepreneurship-related positive attractors as pull factors. Methods: In this paper, regression analysis and Bootstrap were conducted using SPSS 26.0 and MPLUS 7.0, whose applicability has been widely demonstrated in research. Results: Findings were derived from 1042 academics from Chinese universities. Results showed that both push and pull factors do contribute to boosting academic entrepreneurial intention. Particularly, the entrepreneurship-related pull factors including entrepreneurial opportunity identification and expected entrepreneurial benefits play a dominant role in trigging academic intention to engaging entrepreneurship. Moreover, our findings further confirmed the moderating role of social network in the process of academics pushed by negative job-related factors to emerge entrepreneurial intention. Discussion: This study extends the research perspective on the factors influencing academic entrepreneurial intention by examines the impact of push and pull factors on academic entrepreneurial intention simultaneously. This deepens the formation mechanism of academic entrepreneurial intention. Besides, the current study identifies a new look at the role that social network plays in academic entrepreneurship.",2023

We used a survey method to collect data with a sample consisting of 236 academic staff from universities in Northern Cyprus, and tested hypotheses through three different structural models by using structural equation modeling (SEM). Following a deductive approach to establish constructs in the models, we treated academic intrapreneurial intention as the dependent variable, and self-leadership, self-efficacy, and psychological capital as the independent variables. In addition, attitudes toward intrapreneurship, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were individually tested as mediating variables. The results of this study indicate that self-leadership, self-efficacy, and psychological capital have direct and indirect effects on academic intrapreneurial intention, and attitudes toward intrapreneurship, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control play a mediating role between these antecedents and academic intrapreneurial intention.",2024

A literature review,,,,10.13140/RG.2.2.27597.65762,,"This working paper explores the changing roles of university lecturers, who are expected to act as intrapreneurs within their institutions. Through a literature review, this paper highlights the impact of academic capitalism on pedagogy, with lecturers balancing market relevance and academic rigour. It discusses the pressures on lecturers to embrace intrapreneurship, often driven by institutional demands, financial pressures, and performance metrics. These pressures can lead to the emergence of ‘reluctant academic intrapreneurs,’ who adopt entrepreneurial practices out of necessity rather than enthusiasm. The paper identifies key areas for further research, including the impact of academic capitalism on pedagogy, lecturers' adaptation to intrapreneurial roles, and innovation management within academic institutions. It also acknowledges the limitations of this theoretical review, emphasising the need for empirical validation to support the theories discussed. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on the evolving role of university lecturers in a higher education landscape driven by market forces, highlighting the opportunities and challenges of academic capitalism and intrapreneurship.",

To achieve these goals, HEIs engage in a wide range of entrepreneurial activities. In this paper, we posit that many of these activities could be categorized as intrapreneurship rather than entrepreneurship. We further posit that considerable benefit may be garnered by focusing on intrapreneurial activities if universities and HEIs are to progress and sustain their entrepreneurial university status. Our research focus is driven by assumption-challenging because, to date, scholarship has tended to attribute entrepreneurial university success solely to entrepreneurial activities, largely neglecting the intrapreneurial behaviours that drive them. Our core research question asks: What activities do HEIs engage in as part of their entrepreneurial university journey, and which of these could be categorized as intrapreneurial rather than entrepreneurial? We draw on a unique data set and adopt an in-depth, qualitative approach to critically examine the entrepreneurial activities of five HEIs in Finland, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain to highlight their intrapreneurial dimensions. Our findings make three important contributions: First, we enhance understanding of the nature and scope of the activities in which HEIs engage as part of their entrepreneurial university journey; second, we offer an analytical framework to highlight the intrapreneurial dimensions of activities traditionally deemed to be entrepreneurial; third, we signpost scholars toward promising avenues of future research in the context of intrapreneurship and the entrepreneurial university.",
