AB  - The traditional university role of performing fundamental research leaves a large gap between the laboratory stage "proof of principle" and the generation of economic benefits in the commercial marketplace. Research funding for universities from the federal government tends to focus on basic research. Companies usually prefer to license technology with most of the risk taken out. This risk reduction normally occurs via the development component of the research and development process. Unfortunately, the cost of D is often 10 plus times the cost of R, which puts this effort out of reach of most universities. In addition, the opportunity for publication and contribution to advancing the state of the art science (the usual focus of university research) is limited as the development activity concentrates on such issues as economic tradeoffs, catalyst life, feedstock impurities, manufacturing processes, corrosion and other materials of construction issues, product specifications, and mechanical hardware problems. To bridge this gap, Illinois Institute of Technology has put in place a series of practices to address the problems that stand in the way of the university's ability to pursue commercial success for new technology. Our primary practice is to establish startup companies by the inventing faculty members who continue to guide the technology development process into the commercial marketplace. Additional contributors are undergraduate students working on these more-practical problems, mutually beneficial strategic alliances with existing commercial companies, incubator facilities with their ancillary networking potential, senior executives and alumni acting as friends of the university in mentoring entrepreneurial faculty, the technology transfer function of the university, the university's marketing and communications professionals, and alignment of startup company interests with the university's goals via equity investment in the company. This presentation describes how these practices have also provided benefits to our development partners from industry.

AB  - The paper examines the roles of formal governance and informal social networking in University-Industry (U-I) knowledge interaction in the context of high-tech Multinational Corporations (MNCs). The issue is approached by conducting a critical literature review with empirical cases from Finland and China. Previous studies on U-I collaboration focus primarily on one-way technology and knowledge transfer. This study argues that especially in the cross-cultural context of high-tech MNCs, more interactive types of knowledge interaction should be of key concern where there are various challenges of informal governance that include, for example, interpersonal trust, mutual commitment, frequency of communication andinteraction, and awareness of cultural and knowledge-related gaps between collaboration partners.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the strong and weak aspects of industrial product design (IPD) and industrial design (ID) education in Turkey in the context of their relations with Turkish industry. This study was conducted in four major phases. The study started with a SWOT analysis of the economy in Turkey and continued with an analysis of ID education using data on undergraduate and graduate education programmes, the number of faculty members, the number of graduates and the number of registered students. After identifying the profile of the industrial designer from the perspective of industry through online job advertisements, the correlation between the expectations of industry and the philosophy of ID and IPD education programmes in Turkey was analysed. The findings demonstrate that Turkey is behind other countries in terms of intellectual property rights, new products development and investment in new fields of business. Moreover, the share of resources allocated for research and development is insufficient. The education model of IPD and ID graduate programmes is inconsistent with the industry expectations. The expectations of the industry and the educational emphases of university programmes are extremely incompatible. The findings of this study will help to develop cooperation between industry and education programmes and will thus lead to better employment opportunities for graduates of IPD and ID programmes. © BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING PLC 2013 PRINTED IN THE UK.

AB  - The collaboration between universities and the industry is increasingly perceived as a vehicle to enhance innovation through knowledge exchange. This is evident by a significant increase in studies that investigate the topic from different perspectives. However, this body of knowledge is still described as fragmented and lacks efficient comprehensive view. To address this gap, we employed a systematic procedure to review the literature on universities-industry collaboration (UIC). The review resulted in identifying five key aspects, which underpinned the theory of UIC. We integrate these key aspects into an overarching process framework, which together with the review, provide a substantial contribution by creating an integrated analysis of the state of literature concerning this phenomenon. Several research avenues are reported as distilled from the analysis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose an institutional entrepreneurship approach to examining management accounting change triggered by social and environmental concerns. Design/methodology/approach - The study begins with a literature review concerning the role that old institutional economics and new institutional sociology have played in the study of management accounting change, underlining strengths and weaknesses. To deal with the main weaknesses, the institutional entrepreneurship approach is presented and utilized as the basis for the development of a conceptual framework, which is contextualized to the examination of management accounting change triggered by sustainability issues. Findings - Management accounting change literature has not paid enough attention to the social constructivist roots of institutional theory. Through the application of a conceptual framework inspired by institutional change models and institutional entrepreneurship literature, this paper proposes another approach to examine how new management accounting practices are socially constructed during the course of organizational change, particularly in response to sustainability concerns. Research limitations/implications - This new framework has not yet demonstrated its explanatory power in a particular field. Originality/value - The paper examines management accounting change as a social construction process led by institutional entrepreneurs who aim to mobilize resources and negotiate the definition and implementation of sustainability strategies and new management accounting practices, which will take environmental and social issues into consideration, in order to reach an agreement on the pre-institutionalization, diffusion and institutionalization of sustainable practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Accelerating the international use of climate mitigation technologies is key if efforts to curb climate change are to succeed, especially in developing countries, where weak domestic technological innovation systems constrain the uptake of climate change mitigation technologies. Several intergovernmental agencies have set up specific programmes to support the diffusion of climate mitigation technologies. Using a simplified technological innovation system-based framework, this paper aims to systematically review these programmes, with the dual aim of assessing their collective success in promoting technological innovation, and identifying opportunities for the newly formed UNFCCC Technology Mechanism. We conclude that, while all programmes reviewed have promoted technology transfer, they have given limited attention to innovation capabilities with users, government and universities. Functions that could be further developed include knowledge development, legitimation and market formation. These could be focal areas for the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism. We recommend that, in future programmes, part of the funding is dedicated to programmes doing research and development as well as capability development. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose - A research study has been undertaken at the University of South Australia to introduce application of lessons learned process in construction contractors' bidding process in the context of knowledge management. The study aims to identify barriers to effectively capture lessons learned in Australian construction industry and how knowledge management can benefit from lessons learned application. Design/methodology/approach - The research study has been undertaken through conducting a "methodological triangulation" and "interdisciplinary triangulation". This involved an extensive literature review of knowledge management, organisation learning, lessons learned and associated processes and administration of a questionnaire to a sample of construction contractors operating in Australia to elicit opinions on the main barriers to capturing lessons learned, practices such as existence and retention of documentation procedures. A total of 81 useable responses were received from 450 organisations. Response data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics with correlation analysis to examine the strength of relationship among the barriers. Findings - The top-3 barriers to the effective capturing of lessons learned were "lack of employee time", "lack of resources" and "lack of clear guidelines", whereas, "lack of management support" was the least ranked barrier. The study established that despite the majority of the ACCs having formal procedures for recording the tenders submitted and their outcomes, only a minority actually retained the lessons learned documentation for each project. The larger contractors were found to be more aware of the importance of lessons learned documentation. A comparative analysis with previous studies also found a disparity in the ranking of the barriers. Research limitations/implications - The majority of the participants were small construction contractors in Australia. The reason is that the researchers were not aware of the contractors' size prior to inviting them for participation in the research study. Second the findings may not generalize to other industries or to organisations operating in other countries. Originality/value - The findings of this survey help ACCs to understand the importance of lessons learned documentation as part of lessons learned implementation and identify the barriers to effectively document their lessons learned. The study provides insights on the barriers and proposes advocated solutions in form of drivers and enablers (critical success factors) of organisational learning capturing among the Australian construction contractors. By reviewing the current literature, "post-project reviews" and "lessons learned" as important elements of organisation learning knowledge transfer, are addressed. Finally, contribution of this study to knowledge and practice has been discussed in this paper. Copyright © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study concerns the market for research collaboration between industry and universities. It presents an analysis of the population of all Italian university-industry collaborations that resulted in at least one international scientific publication between 2001 and 2003. Using spatial and bibliometric analysis relating to scientific output of university researchers, the study shows the importance of geographic proximity in companies' choices of university partner. The analysis also reveals inefficiency in the market: in a large proportion of cases private companies could have chosen more qualified research partners in universities located closer to the place of business. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present a possible teaching-research-innovation synergy framework that may work for one University of Technology (UoT) that is moving towards becoming an entrepreneurial university in order to bring about practical solutions for the socio-economic needs of the surrounding communities. A literature review was undertaken to interrogate the possibility of applying the teaching-research-innovation nexus at one university of technology in South Africa. Literature shows that the teaching-research-innovation nexus is a debate that has always occupied higher education. Some researchers argue that there can be no teaching without research or research without teaching. However, bringing synergy between teachingresearch and innovation is a complex process. The literature revealed that in order to realise the synergy among the three forces it is vital for an entrepreneurial university to forge partnerships with industry and surrounding communities. The authors believe that, with broad economic participation, innovation and new enterprise development - realisable for instance through a science park within the institution to support entrepreneurship - poverty among neighbouring communities can be mediated. The process will contribute to the country's development initiatives.

AB  - Hemoglobinopathies are the most common global monogenic disorders with significant mortality and morbidity of the survivors. This is due to poor understanding of the disease(s) by health care professionals and also lack of resources. We have designed a Master's degree in hemoglobinopathies course, the first of its kind, using cutting-edge lively state-of the-art media-based technology, to attain excellence in teaching and learning. The modular program is delivered by 100% virtual learning (VLE) tools. The lectures, given by international experts, are blended with interactive quizzes and assessment tools to make the program engaging. Other activities include video-based tutorials, walk-in surgeries, journal clubs and other web-based activities. We have currently received 40 intakes and the program is running successfully with excellent student feedback using quality control framework of the University College London (UCL), London, UK. In conclusion, we have shown the feasibility of VLE for knowledge and skill transfer to global healthcare professionals for a monogenic disorder. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to propose a framework to evaluate the entrepreneurship intensity (EI) of Iranian state universities. In order to determine EI, a hybrid multi-method framework consisting of Delphi, Analytic Network Process (ANP), and VIKOR is proposed. The Delphi method is used to localize and reduce the number of criteria extracted from a deep literature review, according to the social and economic conditions of Iranian state universities by using an expert panel, including sixty-eight country-wide academicians and practitioners. After that, a group approach to ANP was utilized as an evaluation method to derive the weights of each criterion. Next, the evaluation data were gathered through a questionnaire, and, finally, the compromise ranking of universities was calculated using the VIKOR method. Moreover, this study applies weight-variance analysis (WVA) to suggest improvement actions. The paper proposes an evaluation framework for determining the performance of entrepreneurship development initiatives in universities. By using this framework, twenty-two Iranian state universities are evaluated in terms of their EI, and the results are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper addresses an issue that has been largely ignored so far in the empirical literature on the role of patents in university-industry knowledge transfer: does it matter who owns the patents on university research? We observe that especially in Europe, many patents in which university researchers are listed as inventors are not owned by the university. From a literature review, we conclude that private ownership of university patents may reduce the efficiency of the knowledge transfer process. This hypothesis is put to an empirical test, using data on patents in six European countries. Specifically, we assesswhetheruniversity-owned patents(inEurope)aremoreoftenapplied,and/ormore economically valuable, than university-invented (but not-owned) patents. Our results indicate that, after correcting for observable patent characteristics, there are only very small differences between university-owned and university-invented patents in terms of their rate of commercialization or economic value. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In this paper, first we shall define a list of technology transfer barriers in the biotechnology field through interviews and literature reviews. Next, we shall categorize them into four major categories of technology, and at last introduce all of the hypotheses on the existence of relationship between each part of technology and failure in the technology transfer process. Questionnaires consisting of two parts were created and handed out to all of the specialists and biotechnology idea-holders in the Iranian National Research center of Biotechnology, Lidco Co, Iran Pastor Institute, Biotechnology Department of University of Tehran, etc. Going on, we've evaluated the factors' validity through statistical tests and the recognized barriers' priorities in each category, which were generally, identified by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) via the software Expert Choice. These priorities describe the high importance of organization-ware (34.1%), information-ware (27%), technique-ware (20.7%) and eventually human-ware (18.1%) respectively. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - In the era of knowledge-based economy and society (KBES), human capital (HC), intellectual capital(IC), creativity, innovation and education play an increasing role in the portfolio of assets owned by an organization. The importance of knowledge is acknowledged through various papers and studies on knowledge production and its impact on growth. In a knowledge-based economy characterized by the production, transmission and dissemination of knowledge, the higher education institutions (universities) play a unique role in all these knowledge process steps. An efficient knowledge management in a university will ensure the best use of available resources and best use of the knowledge as a key resource; creation / generation of new knowledge; understanding and awareness; capturing, organizing, storing the knowledge at individual, group and organization level; and knowledge transfer to other persons or other organizations. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role of universities in supporting the development of knowledge economy in Romania and to highlight the extent to which students consider that the Romanian economic university system is ready to face the demands of KBES. The results are based on students' perception on the role that the higher education institutions within the context of KBES in Romania. The study is based on the answers of questioned students from the Faculty of Business Administration with teaching in foreign languages (FABIZ) of the Academy of Economic Studies of Bucharest. The study acknowledged the importance of knowledge management in education institutions and identified challenges that the institutions will be facing. The paper is structured as following: the first part of the paper introduces briefly the concepts of knowledge and knowledge-based economy and society; the second part provides a short literature review on knowledge production and its importance for growth; the third part draws on the role the higher education institutions can play as knowledge institutions; part four presents the case-study assessing the perceived role of higher education institutions within the context of KBES in Romania, while the last part concludes.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual viewpoint which proposes the use of the post graduate Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) approach to learning in undergraduate education and practice-based training. Design/methodology/approach: This is an examination of the KTP approach and how this could be used effectively in undergraduate education and training to encourage and increase practice-based learning and employer engagement. The methodology consists of a literature review, and a case study of the KTP approach. The literature reviewed examines the KTP approach, employer engagement in education and strategic government approaches to stimulate investment in knowledge and skills for workforce development, and the development of practice-based learning in the UK. The KTP provides a case study to illustrate a successful model of employer engagement, which benefits all parties to it, and assists with the strategic development required by successive governments. Findings: The suggestions are based on the authors' investigation and their understanding and experience of: the KTP approach; practice-based learning; undergraduate education; and learning and teaching approaches. The paper suggests that the KTP approach (normally a post-graduate model) could be extended to undergraduate education to provide sustainable practice-based learning that fits well with the strategies and ideologies of government, employers and academia. Practical implications: Barriers to employer and academic engagement, such as that linked to the confused terminology used to describe practice-based learning, and competing political ideologies, should be researched further to gain a better understanding of how to mitigate these in order to make the KTP approach in undergraduate education successful. The implications are that synergistic development of the KTP approach in an increased range of academic and workplace partnerships needs to be done before a fully tested model could be agreed. Originality/value: The originality is the idea of utilising a well acknowledged post-graduate model of learning within an undergraduate environment. The value is to increase the awareness of the benefits of the KTP and how the approach could be adapted for use in undergraduate environments for the eventual benefit of students, academics, employers and policy makers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Digital technology has changed how people interact with information and each other. Being able to access and share information ensures healthcare practitioners can keep abreast of new and ever changing information and improve services. The purpose of this paper is to present an information management-knowledge transfer (IM-KT) framework which emerged from a study looking at digital literacy in the occupational therapy profession. Design/methodology/approach: The research was undertaken in three stages. First an in-depth literature review was undertaken, which enabled the creation of an initial conceptual framework which in turn, informed the second stage of the research: the development of a survey about the use of digital technologies. Occupational therapy students, academics and practitioners across five different countries completed the survey, after which refinements to the framework were made. The IM-KT framework presented in this paper emerged as a result of the third stage of the study, which was completed using the Delphi technique where 18 experts were consulted over four rounds of qualitative questionnaires. Findings: The IM-KT framework assists individuals and groups to better understand how information management and knowledge transfer occurs. The framework highlights the central role of information literacy and digital literacy and the influence of context on knowledge transfer activities. Originality/value: The IM-KT framework delineates clearly between information and knowledge and demonstrates the essential role of information literacy and digital literacy in the knowledge era. This framework was developed for the occupational therapy profession and may be applicable to other professions striving to keep up to date with best evidence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this paper, the experiment settings and the evaluation of gamifying a biology class using the digital learning game platform Tourney (Korkut et al., 2014) are presented. This platform, retitled as BioTourney and equipped with biology-related contents, is implemented as a self-learning assessment tool in the biology curriculum of 10th and 11th grade of a secondary school (age group: 15-17). It provides an e-learning game environment for self-paced learning based on the ability to overcome increasingly difficult levels of the biology learning curriculum. As a major gamification aspect, mastering individual levels was rewarded through feelings of achievement. Tourney itself has been developed at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland in 2014 by an interdisciplinary team of researchers from business/economics, design, computer science, applied psychology and pedagogics. The project continues to develop solutions for various application areas in higher education. Besides state-of-the-art design and game technology, Tourney comprises gamified elements of learning in order to enhance learning outcomes and knowledge transfer. With the contentindependent framework structure, teachers can create customized challenges for students by choosing and assembling modular elements associated with course-relevant learning materials. BioTourney has been released for application in the classroom after thoughtful preparation and careful testing with beta users outside the school. The experiment was carried out in October 2015 with a limited number of pupils (N=32) who have never played the game before. Game play data from the experiment have been collected and analyzed with regards to user knowledge and user interactions with the game. Learning engagement and the players' perception of learning progress were assessed through an online survey. Although the feedback has indicated moderate enjoyment in playing BioTourney, the majority of pupils have implied that they have learned something. Gameplay data analysis and player feedback suggest that BioTourney is an example where game-based learning has made a positive, measurable impact and supported personalized learning. The paper presents the research setup, the BioTourney tool as well as the test environment, and discusses the benefits and future adaptations. © The Authors, 2016. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to contribute to a deeper understanding of tutor-learner interactions within the framework of a supportive process of appropriation of technology in the context of elearning. In addition to e-learning, the literature review focuses on two theoretical fields: Appropriation, and e-Tutoring. This leads us to question the modes of e-Tutoring and their evolution; and the media coverage of the tutor in the learners&#39; process of learning. A case study, performed at Aix Marseille University, enables us to identify elements of responses to previous questions. The results show that four recurrent situated actions emerge and three types of usage. They also show that the tutor is seen primarily in a supporting role, and that he may be the social link between the platform and the learners. Beyond these results, we found that the e-Tutors may also have two other e-Tutoring roles: knowledge manager and facilitator of peer-Tutoring. This allows us ultimately to suggest that a goal of e-learning systems is to set up an e-Tutoring system, while leaving the emergence and fostering of self-organization to the learners themselves. Our research also shows that the goal of &quot;making technology transparent&quot; is reached when the acquisition of technology by students is initiated and promoted from the upstream phases of the teaching process.

AB  - This paper analyzes the emergence of academic spin-offs, with a specific focus on those derived from basic knowledge in the natural sciences (mainly Physics and Chemistry). These companies emerged in the context related to science, technology and innovation and the evolution of the University's mission. Hence, it is possible to state the importance of initiatives to stimulate university-industry relationship, the transfer/licensing of technologies and the creation of spin-off companies. In addition, the literature review addresses the concepts related to academic entrepreneurship, as well as the definitions, development models and factors that affect the process of creation and development of academic spin-offs. Therefore, an exploratory and qualitative approach was adopted. Three case studies were conducted in chemistry and physics incubated companies founded between 1990 and 2009, created by senior researchers of University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The main interest was to understand the similarities and particularities of these companies within technology-based start-ups. By performing multiple case studies, it is possible to conclude that there are characteristics related to the entrepreneur and to his company that greatly influence their growth. These characteristics are mainly related to their process of creation and development, the importance of resources, corporate formation and team formation, the product development process and the articulation of the business model. These cases are important to stimulate entrepreneurial initiatives among researchers and professionals in those areas, as examples that induce the creation of a culture for generation of new business in the midst of academic origin.

AB  - Software infrastructures are becoming more and more complex, making performance and dependability monitoring in wide and dynamic contexts such as Distributed Systems, Systems of Systems (SoS) and Cloud environments an unachievable goal. Consequently, it is very difficult to know how all the specific parts, services and modules of these systems behave. This negatively impacts our ability in detecting anomalies, because the boundaries between normal and anomalous behaviors are not always known. The paper describes the context and the targeted problem highlighting the research directions that the student will follow in the next years. In particular, after introducing the relevance of this work with respect to the academic and the industrial state of the art, we carefully define the problem and summarize the main challenges that arise according to such problem definition. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose – Knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) and particularly academic entrepreneurship (Klofsten and Jones-Evans, 2000) are indispensable for economic growth and wealth creation. In many European countries including Germany, substantially fewer women than men participate in KTT. Recently, decision makers from scientific, political, and commercial organisations have increased their attention to the gender dimension (e.g. Moser, 2007; Schiebinger, 2013). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate in what ways and to what degree gender is currently integrated in German KTT. Design/methodology/approach – By following an abductive approach (Suddaby, 2006) and building upon existing models (Klofsten and Jones-Evans, 2000; Carlsson et al., 2002; Lundvall, 2010), the authors developed an analytical framework for evaluating the position of the gender dimension in KTT, conducted a comprehensive literature review, and 22 key informant interviews. Findings – The findings indicate that the gender dimension is barely integrated in German KTT, which particularly manifests itself through the fact that there are fewer than 10 per cent women among academic entrepreneurs. Current organisational practices and attitudes of decision makers continue to reinforce traditional gender roles and “typically male” approaches and behaviours (Connell, 2005; Redien-Collot, 2009). Originality/value – The authors were the first to synthesise a variety of sources into one unified framework and to rigorously analyse the gender dimension in German KTT – both quantitatively and qualitatively and on different levels. This framework can help decisions makers, both in- and outside of Germany, re-envision KTT practices, and create new opportunities for its diverse participants. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the impacts that knowledge transfer has on risk management capabilities in a project based environment. To this end, a literature review was conducted and a conceptual model was built. This model used lessons learned, best practices, and near misses as focal points for knowledge transfer. For risk management, the planning, identification, analyzing, handling, documenting, and monitoring of risks were used as fundamental components. A hypothesis from the model was tested using a self-administered survey and statistical analysis. The results support the hypothesis that an increase in knowledge transfer will have a positive impact on risk management capabilities in projects. These results have implications for academics and engineering managers by providing evidence of the positive relationship between knowledge transfer and risk management capabilities in a project based environment. This research also provides areas for future research to further understanding in this area. Copyright, American Society for Engineering Management, 2014.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Existing models of Technology Transfer have limited horizon and are either Qualitative or Quantitative in nature. A model framework is developed which is structured, linked with organizational goal, incorporates both concepts and has a wider scope. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The research methodology used in this study is a combination of literature review and key informant interviews. The literature review includes both published as well as unpublished sources of literature. In case of key informant interviews, informal telephonic discussions have been carried out with the key executives of the organizations (industry, university, research institutions and government officials) who are actively engaged in technology identification, technology sourcing and technology transfer. Findings: It is evident from the study that initial technology transfer started with the passive role of transferee and gradually they started taking the leading role in the whole technology transfer process. At the beginning, technology transfer concept was almost limited to search and transfer, gradually it started focusing on transfer plan and implementation of technology transfer and in most recent time, focus is on effectiveness of technology transfer and creating spirit of innovation. But again each one of the existing models has a limited horizon and applicability. These existing models are too specific in nature whereas the practicing managers are in need of a comprehensive integrated model. The analysis of the limitations of the existing models has proved the necessity for development of an integrated model which is structured, aims to fulfill the aspiration of the organization, closely links with organizational goal and objectives, considers the barriers and issues in technology transfer process and takes care of both Qualitative and Quantitative parameters of technology transfer. Applications/Improvements: This proposed integrated model will help the practicing managers to take proactive approach and control of forthcoming issues of technology transfer, monitor the progress as well and create spirit of innovation.

AB  - Since the Bayh-Dole Act was enacted by the United States in the 80's, several countries in Latin American have developed national policies on technology transfer for the university context. For instance, this is the case of Mexico with the latest science and technology law enacted in 2002 and Brazil with the innovation law enacted in 2004, among others. In these laws are stated that the universities must organize technology transfer offices to manage intellectual property and the corresponding relationship with the enterprises. More recently, in Peru was enacted the new university law in 2015. This law includes orientations for the universities about the internal organization of technology transfer and intellectual property. In this context, the purpose of this study is the literature review about the identification and characterization of the different elements of the technology transfer processes between the university and enterprise. Also, the study aims to learn how the government of different countries is helping to foster the relationship between the university and enterprise through the technology transfer offices. For this has conducted a systematic review of five databases (EBSCO, Emerald, ProQuest, IEEE and Science Direct) and a repository of conferences of the Latin American Association of Technology Management (ALTEC). Firstly, in this search it was selected the papers with the technology transfer words in the title. The period of the searching was from the year 1980 to 2015 and the result was a total of 320 scientific papers in journals and 30 conference papers. Then, it was made an initial filtering with the keywords political, negotiation, barrier, international, strategy and model. Also it was made a second filtering with the keywords University, industry and government. The analysis of the gathered information in this study shows the evolution along the time of the several elements related with the technology transfer process in the university context. Thus, it is stated that there are a growing importance of the technology transfer offices and the university spin-offs. Finally, the literature review is important for outline a framework of policies for the context of Peruvian universities about the organization of the technology transfer.

AB  - A series of community-led, large-scale laboratory experiments, termed "StreamLab", were performed by the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics (NCED) with the purpose of advancing multidisciplinary research, education, and knowledge transfer at the interface of physical/chemical/ biological processes in streams, science-based stream restoration practice, and environmental sensing technologies. Two series of experiments, StreamLab06 and StreamLab08, were conducted in the Main Channel of the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory at the University of Minnesota, a flume 84 m long and 2.75 m wide with water fed by the Mississippi River at a rate of up to 8.5 m3/s. The purpose of this paper is to share with the broader community the data collected with the hope of stimulating further analysis and future experimental campaigns toward advancing our predictive understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological processes in streams. Toward this end, a brief summary of the results to date is included and some ideas for further research are provided. ©2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Higher education rankings constitute a important but controversial topic due to the methodologies applied in existing rankings and to the use being done of these interpreting their results for purposes which they were not designed for. At present there is no international ranking can responds to the needs of all users and that is methodologically sound by considering the various missions of higher education institutions, mainly due to a narrow focus on research giving less importance to other missions in which higher education institutions can excel beyond research such as teaching quality, knowledge transfer, international orientation, regional engagement etc. The European Commission is currently involved in the implementation of a new higher education ranking methodology, characterised by taking into account a diversity of missions and the diversity of existing higher education institutions. The final aim is to create a tool allowing users to choose the performance indicators of their interest and providing them with a personalised ranking according to their interests. This paper describes the motivation for designing such a tool, the principles of the methodology proposed, as well as the steps foreseen to have it ready for end users by 2014. © 2012 Asociación Española de Psicología Conductual.

AB  - Research universities can be more than centers of research and education; in the best cases, they can also be hotbeds of innovation and entrepreneurship. We have examined successful innovators and noted similarities and differences. This article describes results from a preliminary investigation that supports a vibrant innovation ecosystem in the fields of materials, energy, and environment at Stanford University. The results are drawn from interviews of a small number of successful innovators in these fields. All of the interview subjects were similar in that they operated within a gap between the present state of the art and a vision of how a particular innovation could reshape the world around them. Important differences were also observed. We found that successful models can be grouped into three successful classes of inquiry: basic research, the search for new solutions to well-known problems, and exploiting the evolutionary arc of technology. Each class of inquiry appears to be matched to definite approaches, and we believe that distinct factors can be used to drive cultural change and enhance the effectiveness of researchers and organizations. Future research in this area may carefully examine these factors and the broader applicability of these findings to other innovation contexts. Copyright © 2016 Materials Research Society.

AB  - In every manufacturing process field instruments establish the foundation for control. As a result, field instrumentation is an integral part of the control curriculum for engineering disciplines that support process manufacturing. In the Chemical Engineering curriculum most of the hands-on interactions with field instruments occur in the Unit Operations (UO) laboratory. In order to make these interactions industrially relevant, dialogue and active engagement with industry are essential. In this paper we present eight features of our co-operation with industry that have significantly expanded the breadth of the UO laboratory experiences for the Chemical Engineering students and faculty. In addition to providing financial help for state-of-the-art field instruments, our industrial partners have also shared technical resources and know-how that have enabled us to integrate the technology into the curriculum in an industrially relevant way. The most notable elements that distinguish our UO laboratory are the large number of installed field instruments (173), the distributed control system (DSC), the asset management system (AMS), and the high level of active interaction with field instruments. The end result is that our students are developing a marketable skill set directly applicable to the industrial practice of control. Our faculty are benefitting from the co-operation with industry as well by being provided with various opportunities for professional development. © 2016

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how university-based entrepreneurship programs, incorporating real-life venture creation into educational design and delivery, can bridge the gap between entrepreneurship education and technology transfer within the university environment. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review and snowball sampling over a twoyear period, 18 entrepreneurship education programs were identified as applying a venture creation approach. Ten of these programs were selected for case study, including direct interviews and participatory observation during a two-day workshop. Empirical findings were iteratively related to theory within entrepreneurship education and technology transfer. Findings – The paper identifies the bridging capabilities of venture creation programs (VCP) across five core themes, illustrating the potential benefits of closer collaboration between entrepreneurship education and technology transfer in a university environment. Research limitations/implications – A definition for “VCP” is tested empirically. These programs are shown to be sophisticated laboratory environments, allowing for clinical research towards the understanding of entrepreneurship and technology transfer processes. Practical implications – Findings identify practical benefits of combining entrepreneurship education and technology transfer activities, such as increased value creation through not only new firms, but also an entrepreneurially equipped graduate population. VCPs allow for “spin-through” of innovative ideas in the university environment, while simultaneously contributing to entrepreneurial learning. Originality/value – This paper presents findings from the first multiple case study into entrepreneurship education specifically designed to develop real-life venture as part of the core curriculum. Findings provide basis for investigating the value of integrating entrepreneurship education and technology transfer at the university. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The LanammeUCR is an academic entity attached to the Civil Engineering Faculty of the University of Costa Rica. The Transportation Infrastructure Program (PITRA) of LanammeUCR, works directly with the Costa Rican government performing applied research, auditing and technology transfer. It is funded from a law that assigns 1% of the fuel tax collected in Costa Rica to LanammeUCR with the main objective of ensuring the efficiency of road investments in the country. To meet this objective, PITRA has allocated a considerable component of its funds towards the acquisition of high technology/state-of-the-art equipment such as an falling weight deflectometer, road surface profiler, Geo3D, and dynamic testing equipment for material characterization, among others.With the goal of improving the design and construction of pavements structures, as well as better understanding the different materials used, LanammeUCR decided to acquire a Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) with instrumentation.With this Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) equipment, LanammeUCR will be fully equipped to monitor the performance of different pavement structures and materials, and new and improved pavement technologies, and to develop and calibrate a mechanistic-empirical design guide for local weather, materials, and traffic conditions. This paper summarizes the draft plan for the design of the APT facility that will be constructed at LanammeUCR. The facility includes a saturation system to simulate pavement conditions during Costa Rica's intense rainy season. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The paper aims to propose an approach for evaluating and prioritizing a technological idea portfolio, supporting a R&D Lab to select the ideas that can produce better outputs in innovation technology projects in partnership with Universities. Research methodology is based on analysis of the literature about Project and Technology Portfolio Management, the criteria for measuring innovation (Oslo Manual), and the collaboration between research institutions. As a result it was proposed 5 multi criteria drivers, with different weights, in order to strategically evaluate and prioritize ideas: Strategic Contribution (40%), which has evaluated the adherence of the ideas to the strategic areas of the R&D Lab; Technological Contribution (20%), which has assessed the contribution of an idea to the state of the art in that research area; Institutional Relationship (20%), which has verified the elements needed for establishing a partnership with Universities and intellectual property clauses; Technology Transfer (10%) which has evaluated the potential for creating and improving internal competencies, and Social Impact which is related to the contribution to local social development. This approach also can support others R&D Labs who needs to evaluate ideas based on strategic drivers that goes besides of the innovation funnel for products. © 2014 PICMET.

AB  - In today's rapidly changing market environments with heterogeneous consumer needs, short product life cycles, and global competition, organizations must perform production ramp-ups more often and react quickly to external changes. This is only possible if the required knowledge is available at the respective organizational units and workplaces. Thus, a central question to answer is: How can spillover effects of learning improve future production ramp-ups? This paper provides an overview over the existing literature on spillover effects of learning for production ramp-ups. Specifically, the antecedents, control mechanisms and performance effects of these spillover effects are considered. While learning and knowledge management in general have received attention for quite some time, there is only little research on the specific means, tools, and methods of spillover learning that are useful for seemingly unrelated processes such as production ramp-ups in different time periods. The literature on spillover learning as well as on organizational learning in production ramp-up is extensive, but the combination of the two is still under-researched. For these reasons, further research in this area can generate insights in how to better ensure transfer of tacit and explicit knowledge in the context of production ramp-ups. In this paper, we first present the state of the art of spillover learning in production ramp-ups by reviewing the existing academic literature. After that, opportunities for future research are outlined. Identified research gaps include that little is known about the process and effectiveness of knowledge transfer between consecutive ramp-ups. Especially, an unanswered question is how deliberate learning as compared to learning by doing influences knowledge spillovers to subsequent ramp-ups. In terms of scientific methods, laboratory experiments have not yet been employed in the context of spillover learning for production ramp-ups. This opens up another interesting and promising direction. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB  - This paper proposes a research agenda for networking for sustainable tourism research based on a collaborative workshop of international tourism academics and researchers and an extensive review of the relevant literature. Each year, Building Excellence in Sustainable Tourism - an Education Network (BEST EN) holds a Think Tank on a topical issue in sustainable tourism education. One aim of the Think Tank is to develop a relevant research agenda that draws on the collective knowledge of participants and acknowledges the interdependent economic, environmental and social objectives in sustainable tourism. Six main areas were identified as important for a research agenda on networking for sustainable tourism and its implementation: theory, methodology and conceptual issues; actors, culture and power; lifecycle, evolution and dynamics of networks; knowledge transfer; macro-perspectives and strategic action, vision, innovation and management of networks. This paper presents and discusses these research themes in the context of a literature review on networks and networking for sustainability in tourism. It is found that substantial progress has been made in the investigation of private sector networks at the destination levels; research on networks involving public sector stakeholders and networks across sectors and levels of governance, however, remains limited. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to consider the extent to which business school transition has created new opportunities in management development, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation. Design/methodology/approach The paper is a critical review of knowledge exchange in a business school context with a particular focus on the “translation or management practice gap”. Findings Change in the nature of research undertaken in business schools opens up new opportunities for collaboration between academia and practice. The paper points to the need for more innovative forms of research engagement encouraging academic-practitioner collaboration and practice-based management development initiatives. Research limitations/implications The paper contributes to the debate on innovative forms of knowledge exchange and transfer and helps stimulate further studies examining potential approaches to fostering co-learning and discovery and participatory forms of knowledge production. Practical implications Changes in business school environment and context offer opportunities for new modes of knowledge exchange both in management development and research. Practice based theory offers a new paradigm of management development. Originality/value Recent commentators refer to notions of academia and practice as “closed systems and self referential” and point to the requirement for greater attention on knowledge transfer, and to learn from knowledge transfer studies concerning practitioner/research communities of practice, networks and collaborations. The paper addresses this deficiency in the literature and points to key areas warranting further research. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Purpose – The information system (IS) discipline and IS departments in universities are facing major challenges which threaten their survival. Knowledge management strategies have been used in various other fields to solve crisis situations and this paper contends that similar approaches could be adopted to address the crises in the discipline of IS. The purpose of this paper is to present a multi/theoretical model that can be used to identify knowledge transfer impediments contributing to the crises in the IS discipline in a university. Design/methodology/approach – Literature on crisis management and crises in the IS discipline was reviewed. This revealed that many crises are caused by lack of appropriate knowledge development and sharing in research and education. Knowledge management research was then reviewed and synthesized to create a comprehensive framework for identifying impediments to knowledge transfer in a university setting. Findings – The findings of the literature review indicates that lack of knowledge management and sharing is one main contributor to the crises in IS discipline. The model developed in the present study will only be tested in the next phase of this research. Practical implications – IS departments can use this framework to identify the impediments to knowledge sharing contributing to crises in research and teaching. Originality/value – This paper adopts an approach used in other disastrous situations to resolve the crises in the IS discipline. It is established in literature that most crises arise due to the lack of proper knowledge management. A framework to examine knowledge transfer impediments in IS discipline is therefore proposed. Two theoretical perspectives to knowledge transfer (i.e. the epistemological and ontological) are combined whereby impediments to tacit and explicit knowledge transfer in the areas of research and teaching, and at various social interaction levels (i.e. individual, group, organizational and inter/organizational levels) can be examined. This provides a more comprehensive analysis of the crisis situation and facilitates the development of holistic knowledge/based solutions needed to respond to the crises. Departments can use the framework to identify critical issues requiring urgent attention or specific needs of individuals, groups, etc. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Introduction: Rural Scotland has an ageing population. There has been an increase in the number of people with dementia and as the proportion of people aged over 75 years continues to rise, this will increase still further. The Scottish Government has produced a dementia strategy and implementing this will be a challenge for rural Scotland. Methods: Transferring academic knowledge into practice is challenging. A Knowledge Transfer Partnership was formed between NHS Highland and the University of Stirling. A literature review was undertaken of the rural dementia literature; local services were surveyed and described; and interviews were undertaken with people with dementia and carers. Work was conducted on training, diagnostic service provision and local policy. Throughout the project, a collaborative approach was used, which aimed at the joint production of knowledge. Results: Involving University staff in local service development had a substantial impact. Reviewing existing research knowledge and setting it in the context of local services, and of experience of service use, allowed the relevant priorities to be identified. As well as identifying training needs and providing training, the work influenced local decisions on diagnostic service design and standards, and on policy. Conclusion: This embedded engagement model appeared to produce more rapid change than traditional models of use of academic knowledge. © C Stark, A Innes, P Szymczynska, L Forrest, K Proctor, 2013.

AB  - Several management studies highlight the importance of collaborative relationships for university-industry knowledge and technology transfer. The present study examines the role of absorptive and desorptive capacity (A/DCAP) of actors in technology transfer processes by pointing out critical elements that may affect regional innovation systems. In this field of action, each university worldwide, as well as public and private research centers, interacts differently with industry. Cultural and economic variances make it difficult to outline one single global model governing knowledge and technology transfer. However, it is possible to identify elements and characteristics that might make this system efficient. Mere interaction is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to ensure that knowledge and technology flow through a feasible dyadic channel from university to industry (U-I) or vice versa (I-U). Indeed, the actors of the process have to develop organizational capabilities at all levels and units (i.e., individual and organizational) based on a social integration system which can facilitate their communication, thus helping to share activities. In this regard, we present a systematic review of research into academic involvement in the regional innovation development environment by identifying individual as well as organizational and institutional layers of this cross-relationship. Apart from being more widely applied, A/DCAP is strictly important for academics in order to access resources and results able to support their research agendas. © 2015, Dell’Anno and del Giudice.

AB  - With university–industry engagement forming an integral part of the policy agenda, this paper underlines current issues and emerging themes in the dedicated literature. It utilises a comprehensive literature review, based on evidence from peer-reviewed journals/public reports published after 2005 in the UK. The paper integrates a wide range of disparate studies on university–industry knowledge transfer patterns, determinants and impacts, and offers a panorama that could be useful to inform on the variety of issues underlying knowledge transfer. Given the importance/complexity of university–industry interactions, a comprehensive study fills an existing gap. Second, due to its focus on current issues, the study opens the way to reflections and debates on critically ‘unanswered’ questions: how to deal with diversity/heterogeneity? How to increase quality in supply/quantity in demand for knowledge? How to increase impact on academics, universities, firms, economy and society? © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Most of the literatures related to university-industry (U-I) and technology transfer assume that the collaboration particularly the U-I joint research is beneficial to both university and industry which as a result underpins the sustainable development of economics and living standards of developed and developing countries. The U-I joint research for photovoltaic technology transfer in a developing country like Thailand should have been increased considering the fact that (i) the government implemented various strategies to support the renewable energy research and market development, (ii) the university aimed to be " research-based university and (iii) the Thai photovoltaic industry struggle for competitiveness and survival in the global market. However, evidence revealed that the university and industry conducted little number of U-I joint projects. In this paper, we investigate the factors influencing the effective U-I joint research for photovoltaic technology transfer (UIJRPTT). In an attempt to better understand the influence of the factors, the path model with factors related to characteristics and perspectives of the university and the industry as well as joint research mechanism and their linkages to higher growth and improved economic and quality performance of the U-I joint research is developed and validated. The developed model empirically explains interaction between the factors and the outcome factors and can assist the government, the university and the industry to devise target strategies to improve the growth and performance of UIJRPTT. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Based on a literature review, this paper investigates the potential of translation theory to energize the study of knowledge transfer between source and recipient organizational units. The central assumption is that translation theory is not only useful for analyzing knowledge-transfer processes, but also has the potential to guide deliberate interventions in such processes. Based on this premise, and drawing on insights from the neighboring academic discipline of translation studies, the author outlines the elements of an instrumental translation theory, with the aim of developing knowledge about how to conduct translations of practices and ideas to achieve various organizational ends in knowledge transfers. The instrumental theory is founded on two main arguments. The first is that knowledge transfers between organizations are rule-based translation processes. The second is that the way in which translators use various translation rules and perform translations may be decisive for outcomes of knowledge-transfer processes. This study develops a typology of three translation modes (the reproducing, the modifying and the radical mode) and four appurtenant translation rules (copying, addition, omission and alteration), and discusses which translation rules fit which conditions. The author identifies three critical conditional variables in knowledge transfers – the translatability of the source practice, the transformability of the transferred knowledge, and the similarity between source and recipient units – and discusses the appropriateness of each translation rule in relation to these variables. © 2016 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Copyright plays a central role in numerous activities within higher education, and educating a university community about copyright law should be a priority, if only to protect the institution from lawsuits. But, based upon a literature review, institutions devote a more resources to other intellectual property activities - plagiarism detection, technology transfer and illegal file sharing management - than for general copyright education activities. Utilizing Mintzberg's organizational model and its discussion of organizational placement and legitimacy as a conceptual framework, this study explores the current copyright education structures among the universities that comprise the Consortium on Institutional Cooperation, otherwise known as the CIC or the Big Ten, to determine whether organizational placement, credentials of individuals, and resources devoted to this activity affect the legitimacy of the office and the authority of copyright officers to fulfill their responsibilities. The results of this study suggest that organizational placement, while it plays a role, is not nearly as important as the credentials of the individual in the position in conveying legitimacy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Previous research has found that organizational innovations are important for organizations’ long-term competitive advantage and for technical innovations. In spite of this conclusion, organizational innovations remain poorly managed and poorly understood, especially the processes through which organizational innovations are created, diffused, and sustained. There is thus a need for a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms catalyzing organizational development and change. The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model for studying and better understanding the creation, diffusion, and sustaining of organizational innovations by using a system perspective. The three concepts “creation,” “diffusion,” and “sustaining” are highly intertwined and should not be explored in isolation, as organizational innovations are constantly being re-invented. The model for catalyzing organizational development and change could be visualized as five steps that form a circular pattern around an organizational-specific and path-dependent improvement trajectory rather than a single organizational innovation. The five steps are influenced by the external context, the internal environment, and the characteristics of the innovation itself. Further, different diffusion channels such as consultants, universities, and standardization forums function as mechanisms for knowledge transfer and triggering one or several of the five steps. The model is developed based on two literature reviews conducted over a 14-year period and findings from two empirical studies covering four Swedish manufacturing firms and one hospital. The model proposed here has already been used in practice in a study for the Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA. Likewise the model proved to be useful in analyzing both similarities and differences between different national programs for catalyzing organizational development. This comprehensive model, we suggest, has a wider and more general use and is applicable across the Triple Helix model. © 2015 Steiber and Alänge.

AB  - A considerable body of work highlights the relevance of collaborative research, contract research, consulting and informal relationships for university-industry knowledge transfer. We present a systematic review of research on academic scientists' involvement in these activities to which we refer as 'academic engagement'. Apart from extracting findings that are generalisable across studies, we ask how academic engagement differs from commercialisation, defined as intellectual property creation and academic entrepreneurship. We identify the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents and consequences of academic engagement, and then compare these findings with the antecedents and consequences of commercialisation. Apart from being more widely practiced, academic engagement is distinct from commercialisation in that it is closely aligned with traditional academic research activities, and pursued by academics to access resources supporting their research agendas. We conclude by identifying future research needs, opportunities for methodological improvement and policy interventions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Universities, public institutions, and the transfer of knowledge to the private sector play a major role in the development of medical technologies. The decisions of universities and public institutions regarding the transfer of knowledge impact the accessibility of the final product, making it easier or more difficult for consumers to access these products. In the case of medical research, these products are pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, or medical procedures. The ethical dimension of access to these potentially lifesaving products is apparent and distinguishes the transfer of medical knowledge from the transfer of knowledge in other areas. While the general field of technology transfer from academic and public to private actors is attracting an increasing amount of scholarly attention, the specifications of knowledge transfer in the medical field are not as well explored. This review seeks to provide a systematic overview and analysis of the qualitative literature on the characteristics and determinants of knowledge transfer in medical research and development. Methods: The review systematically searches the literature for qualitative studies that focus on knowledge transfer characteristics and determinants at medical academic and public research institutions. It aims at identifying and analyzing the literature on the content and context of knowledge transfer policies, decision-making processes, and actors at academic and public institutions. The search strategy includes the databases PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, and DiVa. These databases will be searched based on pre-specified search terms. The studies selected for inclusion in the review will be critically assessed for their quality utilizing the Qualitative Research Checklist developed by the Clinical Appraisal Skills Programme. Data extraction and synthesis will be based on the meta-ethnographic approach. Discussion: This review seeks to further the understanding of the kinds of transfer pathways that exist in medical knowledge transfer as well as what factors lead to the adoption of one pathway over another. The aim is to provide evidence for political and academic actors designing policies for the translation of medical knowledge and public-private cooperation.

AB  - Complications with garment sizing and poor fit inconvenience many consumers who become dissatisfied with such provision on the high street. It is evident that human measurement and classification of the human body based on size and shape are precedent to accurate clothing fit and therefore fundamental to production and consumption. With advancement in technology, automated 3D body scanners designed to capture the shape and size of a human body in seconds and further produce its true-to-scale 3D body model have been developed. The use of data generated is extensive; and include anthropometric dimensions and morphology for the creation of avatars and mannequins. This technology is currently viewed as the frontier in solving fit problems, for instance by generating accurate data for the development of size charts, enabling a pragmatic approach to the offer of mass customisation and also facilitating virtual model fit trials that enhance online clothing shopping experiences. Consumers have become savvier than ever and as the demand for well-fitted garments is increasing, 3D body scanning technology is being viewed as a significant bridge between craftsmanship and computer-aided design technologies. Currently being explored by academic research and not as yet widely implemented across retail sectors, it is expected to facilitate consumer satisfaction and reduce commercial waste due to 'ill-fit' returns. There is therefore a vital need to authenticate procedures and establish systems for practice. This paper seeks to assess the application of one such technology to human measurement for clothing provision and tests procedures for its implementation. The methodology presents a case study approach involving the use of one such state-of-the-art technology in the acquisition of measurement data at a metropolitan university in the UK, and advises on the application of the 3D body scanner in research and sampling activities.

AB  - This article explores the concept of energy security perceived and understood by a sample of government, business, civil society, and university stakeholders in India. Based on a literature review, the authors hypothesize what energy experts suggest energy security is for India. The article then tests these hypotheses through the use of a survey completed by 172 Indian respondents. The article begins by describing its methodology before summarizing the results of the literature review to distill seven working hypotheses related to energy security in India. These hypotheses relate to (1) security of energy supply, (2) equitable access to energy services, (3) research and development of new energy technologies, (4) energy efficiency and conservation, (5) self-sufficiency and trade in energy fuels, (6) nuclear power, and (7) the energy-water nexus. It then tests these hypotheses with our survey instrument before concluding with implications for energy policy in India and beyond. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Rural Scotland has an ageing population. There has been an increase in the number of people with dementia and as the proportion of people aged over 75 years continues to rise, this will increase still further. The Scottish Government has produced a dementia strategy and implementing this will be a challenge for rural Scotland. Methods: Transferring academic knowledge into practice is challenging. A Knowledge Transfer Partnership was formed between NHS Highland and the University of Stirling. A literature review was undertaken of the rural dementia literature; local services were surveyed and described; and interviews were undertaken with people with dementia and carers. Work was conducted on training, diagnostic service provision and local policy. Throughout the project, a collaborative approach was used, which aimed at the joint production of knowledge. Results: Involving University staff in local service development had a substantial impact. Reviewing existing research knowledge and setting it in the context of local services, and of experience of service use, allowed the relevant priorities to be identified. As well as identifying training needs and providing training, the work influenced local decisions on diagnostic service design and standards, and on policy. Conclusion: This embedded engagement model appeared to produce more rapid change than traditional models of use of academic knowledge. © C Stark, A Innes, P Szymczynska, L Forrest, K Proctor, 2013.

AB  - In the academic debate on infrastructures in the Global South, there is a broad consensus that (post)colonial legacies present a major challenge for a transition towards more inclusive, sustainable and adapted modes of providing services. Yet, relatively little is known about the emergence and evolution of infrastructures in former colonies. Until a decade ago, most historical studies followed Daniel Headrick’s (1981) “tools of empire” thesis, painting—with broad brush strokes—a picture of infrastructures as instruments for advancing the colonial project of exploitation and subordination of non-European peoples and environments. This paper explores new research perspectives beyond this straightforward, ‘diffusionist’ perspective on technology transfer. In order to do so, it presents and discusses more recent studies which focus on interactive transfer processes as well as mechanisms of appropriation, and which increasingly combine approaches from imperial history, environmental history, and history of technology. There is much to gain from unpacking the changing motives and ideologies behind technology transfer; tracing the often contested and negotiated flows of ideas, technologies and knowledge within multilayered global networks; investigating the manifold ways in which infrastructures reflected and (re)produced colonial spaces and identities; critically reflecting on the utility of large (socio)technical systems (LTS) for the Global South; and approaching infrastructures in the (post)colonial world through entangled histories of technology and the environment. Following David Arnold’s (2005) plea for a “more interactive, culturally-nuanced, multi-sited debate” on technology in the non-Western world, the paper offers fresh insights for a broader debate about how infrastructures work within specific parameters of time, place and culture. © 2017, Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Worldwide spending of enterprises on information technologies (IT) in 2011 is projected to total USD 2.6 trillion with 350 enterprises each investing more than USD 1 billion. Despite such large and rapidly growing investment figures, the success rates of IT deployment projects over the past 20 years remained relatively low: approximately half of IT deployment projects were unsuccessful. Literature review reveals that inadequate strategic information system planning (SISP) is one of the main reasons for low deployment success rates of IT deployment projects and, thus, one of the current critical IT management issues. For this reason researchers and practitioners in the SISP field are currently directing their efforts into expanding the traditional understanding of SISP as a pure IT planning activity. In addition to the activities dedicated to the planning of IT investments, new SISP models should also include the contextual activities that enable adaptation of the deployed IT to the environment and knowledge transfer from the environment. In this paper, the authors propose an extended SISP model that includes influences of environmental stakeholders. The developed SISP model was empirically tested on a sample from the population of 1000 largest enterprises in Slovenia. The authors believe that the findings of their research and the suggested extended SISP model will improve understanding of SISP success factors in enterprises and consequently enable them to manage their IT investments with greater success. © 2013 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - Knowledge transfer partnerships (KTPs) enable universities to work collaboratively with businesses and other organisations. KTPs have mutual benefits for both organisations, enabling the university to increase its commercial potential and business/service organisations to increase their capacity for growth, development and sustainability. This article presents a literature review of KTPs followed by a case study of a KTP between a university (University of Greenwich) and a charity (The Metro Centre), which provides services to people experiencing issues related to sexuality, gender and diversity and that primarily supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. An evaluation of this KTP has demonstrated gains and benefits for both the university and Metro, primarily in terms of increasing the evidence-base of the work of Metro and developing its research capacity. This has resulted in the acquisition of significant national funding for a range of projects and studies related to the aims of both the University and Metro.

AB  - Universities are increasingly institutionalizing activities related to technology transfer and one of the main institutional mechanisms that has emerged is the "technology transfer unit" (TTU). Many of them are focusing their activities on the management of the university intellectual property. Studies have investigated factors that seem to affect their performance, but few have looked in detail at internal procedures and techniques that are used in their processes related to technology evaluation and licensing. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of some of the several steps that comprises the processes regarding technology evaluation and licensing, providing an analysis of the critical issues that affect each step of the process. A review of the literature was made, complemented with interviews to seven university TTUs, which was used as a check and a complement to the literature review and as way of perceiving from an insider perspective, the problems and issues that this paper wants to emphasize and to state clearly.

AB  - Conferences and Themes HealthGrid 2010 (http://paris2010.healthgrid.org) is the eighth meeting of this open forum for the integration of grid technologies, e-science and e-health methods and their applications in the biomedical and healthcare domains. The principal objective of the HealthGrid conference and of the HealthGrid Association is the exchange and debate of ideas, technologies, solutions and requirements that interest the grid and the life-science communities and are likely to promote the integration of grids into biomedical research and health in the broadest sense. Participation is encouraged for grid middle-ware and healthgrid application developers, biomedical and health informatics users, ethicists and security experts, and policy makers to participate in a set of multidisciplinary sessions with a common focus on bringing healthgrids closer to real application in the health domain. HealthGrid conferences have been organized on an annual basis. The first conference, held in 2003 in Lyon (http://lyon2003.healthgrid.org), reflected the need to involve all actors - physicians, scientists and technologists - who might play a role in the application of grid technology to health, whether healthcare or biomedical research. The second conference, held in Clermont-Ferrand in January 2004 (http://clermont2004.healthgrid.org) reported on the earliest efforts in research, mainly work in progress, from a large number of projects. The third conference in Oxford (http://oxford2005.healthgrid.org) had a major focus on first results and exploration of deployment strategies in healthcare. The fourth conference in Valencia (http://valencia2006.healthgrid.org) aimed at consolidating the collaboration among biologists, healthcare professionals and grid technology experts. The fifth conference in Geneva (http://geneva2007. healthgrid.org) focused on the five domains defined by the European Commission as application areas for 'vertical integration' through grids in the biomedical field: molecules, cells, organs, individuals, and populations. For each of these five domains, an invited speaker gave a state of the art address followed by concrete projects. This was a loud signal to the community that the usefulness of grids to potential application domains could be demonstrated at least at the prototype level. This theme was also evident at the sixth conference in Chicago (http://chicago2008.healthgrid.org), which proclaimed its focus as 'e-Science Meets Biomedical Informatics'. The sixth conference was also a landmark in the history of the organisation HealthGrid - and its newly established affiliate HealthGrid.US - as the first conference to be organised outside Europe. As we put it at the time, this was a celebration of similarities and differences, a moment to validate models and principles beyond one's familiar shores. The seventh conference returned to Europe, taking place for the first time in Germany in Berlin (http://berlin2009.healthgrid.org). While most themes touched on in earlier conferences continued to be present, certain other themes came to the fore perhaps more clearly than ever before: accessibility, the fraught challenge of usability, and the question of a business case for healthgrids. Ethical, legal, social and economic issues are sometimes encapsulated in the acronym ELSE, with the wry joke that we would like "someone else" to take care of them; perhaps more clearly than before, the Berlin conference embraced and debated these issues directly. Along with these, a hint of 'cloud' also hovered over the discussion of core technologies - and a less metaphorical cloud burst over the open-air conference dinner to refresh participants. While the desire to promote healthgrid applications to real healthcare settings remains central to the community's ambitions, it is also true that the majority of adopters work in academic environments where research is their principal preoccupation. Judging from the full range of papers submitted this year, cloud computing appears set to make an impact, just when healthcare informatics appears readier to adopt that paradigm, perhaps in preference to grids. So it may turn out that grids will remain the infrastructure of choice for research and clouds for (the business of) healthcare. Conference at Orsay, Paris, 2010 The call for papers issued in January resulted in 42 submissions; after a review process in which all papers were read by two independent reviewers as well as at least one, sometimes two members of the Steering Committee, 19 papers were accepted for full presentation. In addition, several papers described work that is still at an early stage and not yet ready for presentation as a full paper, or presented work of considerable scientific merit but which had not yet been fully implemented in a grid. These were considered worthy of inclusion in the conference as posters and, in a shorter form, in the proceedings. Section One - Socio-Economic Aspects and Accessibility Xin Zhou et al. conducted an extensive survey of opinion about grids in the public sector. Among the significant findings were discrepancies between expectations of users and administrators, hinting at an inherent tension in the concept of grids as a means of full exploitation of resources. Hanene Rahmouni's report of semi-automated compliance checking, extending her earlier work on the SHARE project, leads to an optimistic picture suggesting that technology and the dread 'ELSE' issues are not entirely at odds. Yassene Mohammed and colleagues consider the means of technology and knowledge transfer in the grid world. They discuss the players, problems and media at work in the process of technology adoption among life scientists. Their analysis examines in particular the medium of exchange (including, e.g., newly trained user experts) and explores various explanatory paradigms of technology transfer. Femida Gawdry-Sridhar and Silvia Olabarriaga with co-authors compare developments in Canada and in the Netherlands in the light of the vision of the HealthGrid 'white paper' broad road maps of the SHARE project. They find grounds for optimism but also identify similar obstacles and resistances on both sides. Section Two - Future of Grids, Core Technologies & Data Integration Adam Kraut and colleagues compared clouds vs clusters in an 'embarrassingly parallel' biomedical application. This is justified on the grounds of compute-intensity of the application, but judged on usability and performance. This should certainly be a good challenge for the cloud paradigm; the results are somewhat unfavourable. TRENCADIS, which will be familiar to readers of this series, was originally built with a Service-Oriented Architecture. It has now been ported by Ignacio Blanquer et al. to gLite using features of DICOM Structured Reports and ontologies to integrate data from diverse imaging and associated data. Reporting from ACGT, Garcia, Karlsson and Trelles describe a catalog of service metadata to support discovery and integration of services. Their approach nicely highlights trade-offs between expressiveness and ease of discovery and composition. Ashiq Anjum et al. explore the proposed reuse of a highly sophisticated database designed to track the construction of a CERN experiment as a provenance engine in the neuGRID project. Benbelgacem, Niimaki and Abdennadher extend the work previously reported in 2008 on healthgrid adoption and adaptation of XtremWeb-CH and lead through these developments to the release of a new infrastructure, XWCH2. A large collaboration from the NeuroLOG project report on its data management layer and their successful federation of neuroimaging data. This has allowed them to achieve semantically tight integration of data from diverse, loosely coupled sources. The Décrypthon project has established a grid infrastructure for biomedical applications. Although the authors' focus was on the technology (middleware, query language) they illustrate it with a valuable application to neuromuscular disorders. Paul de Vlieger et al. report on an application that was foreseen even in the HealthGrid 'white paper' as one of the founding challenges for healthgrids. The idea is to integrate diverse, geographically distributed databases so as to be able to derive meaningful epidemiological information from the base data, in this case from various cancer screening programmes. Finally in this section, David Ritchie et al report on the use of special processors for certain biomedical tasks. In particular, the already efficient Hex protein docking algorithm turns out to run significantly faster on graphics processor units. This has certain interesting implications for technology choices in specialist grids for biomedical research. Section Three - Applications A team from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin report on the increasing need for imaging in liver disease. Segmentation of MRI images is sufficiently complex to justify use of a grid. The results are compared with an expert's segmentation. Lessons are also drawn for further innovation in healthgrids. Hausmann, Knoch et al. describe GLOBE 3D Genome Platform an interactive collaboration grid platform for the analysis and visualization of results from their novel COMBO-FISH method of labelling genomic sequences. Jason Haga and team from California and Japan began their work with the observation of inconsistencies in virtual screening using DOCK on a heterogeneous grid. They experimented with virtualization to overcome heterogeneity and show that variability in results is much reduced. This work again raises the issue of clouds. Arun Datta and colleagues describe a grid-based epidemiological application integrating information for childhood obesity surveillance. This is an increasingly pressing problem in better off nations. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Next to theoretical design of a Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) experimentally characterization is a major process within the overall development. Due to this a new test facility, a so called Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) test facility, for PPTs at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at University of Stuttgart is developed. The test stand is based on existing measuring instruments as well as know-how gathered during the long-term development and investigation of PPTs at IRS, i.e. ADD SIMPLEX, PETRA and PET. The HIL facility is distinguished by being compact, modular and extensible for future experiments enabling a characterization of miniature PPTs and Pulsed Electrothermal Thrusters (PET) in the energy range of some Joules. Main basis for the test stand is an already existing and well proven micro Newton thrust pendulum. In order to set up the HIL facility the pendulum is equipped with several measuring instruments to receive thruster specific performance data, i.e. thrust, capacitor's discharge current and voltage as well as magnetic field data of the plasma plume. Additionally, high speed imaging of the plasma plume will be performed. To investigate the thruster's behavior at different capacitances, capacitors can be disabled or engaged during test campaigns enabling, e.g. investigation of a complete or temporally failure of capacitors during a mission. The development of the HIL facility is in close connection to the new development thruster PETRUS (Pulsed Electric Thruster of the University of Stuttgart). PETRUS is a coaxial, PTFE based, low energy thruster designed and optimized for CubeSat applications like "CubeSat Atmospheric Probe for Education" (CAPE). As PPTs are characterized by a simple design and a high reliability, PETRUS shall be used as a primary propulsion system performing a controlled de-orbit maneuver. Furthermore, the modular design of PETRUS allows the investigation of thermal and magnetodynamic effects by using different attachments, e.g. nozzle or cylindrical acceleration path making it possible to: 1) verify or improve present simulation models and 2) investigate scaling laws of PPTs. This paper describes the development of a state-of-the-art HIL test facility characterizing low energy PPTs and PETs. Moreover, a new PPT based thruster (PETRUS) for CubeSat applications is introduced which is tested and characterized by using the HIL facility.

AB  - Generally, a risk-informed analysis will involve a relatively broad spectrum of disciplines and realistic engineering analysis as required in NRC guidance. Traditionally, engineering analysis in commercial nuclear power applications has lacked detailed uncertainty analysis and quantification. Instead, "worst case" or credible extremes are evaluated separately. Where uncertainty has been evaluated [16, 17], it is not clearly related to risk or scenario importance. Quantification of risk and uncertainty is a basic need in a risk-informed regulatory paradigm. The risk-informed pilot project developed and used a new integrative approach, which could be more suitable in the risk-informed regulatory setting. More specifically, in this project (a) underlying physical and chemical models for the post-LOCA PRA basic events, associated with the concerns raised in GSI-191, were developed outside the PRA and (b) uncertainties were propagated in the physical models in order to have their results ready to be incorporated into PRA. The probabilities of the basic events (and their associated uncertainties), as they were obtained from the models of the underlying physical and chemical phenomena, were then incorporated into PRA. The uncertainties in the probabilities of basic events were also propagated through the PRA scenarios. The risk-informed pilot project is unique in some aspects such as it : (1) advances the PRA methodologies and applications by the integration of underlying physical and chemical phenomena, (2) presents the state-of-the art integration of probabilistic methods (e.g., uncertainty analysis, statistical analysis, risk analysis) and deterministic techniques (e.g., experimental testing, computer-aided design, and computational fluid dynamics), and (3) arose from collaborative work by teams of experts from industry and academia. The risk-informed project started in academia, but without private sector industry support, practical implementation would not have been possible. The utility and, particularly, its staff members assigned to solve the problem, maintained close relationships with the academic faculty, making it possible to react quickly to challenging research needs and to search for scientific and practical solutions. It is absolutely essential to understand how to incorporate practical experience from industrial practitioners in a project like the pilot project in order to produce a truly implementable program that can be an on-going operating experience. The progress of the research and its implementation have also significantly benefitted from the discussions and feedback received from regulatory representatives. The methodology used in the pilot project can be applied for other risk-informed projects related to nuclear power plants. Some of the authors are currently proposing to apply a similar methodology to fire PRA [18] and seismic PRA [19]. Another important area is the incorporation of underlying safety culture and organizational factors into risk-informed regulation. One of the authors has worked in this area of research [20] and, is advancing the benefits for applications to the nuclear power industry.

AB  - Purpose – Mexico is an OECD member country that historically has allocated less than half a per cent of its gross domestic product to spend on research and experimental development. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the country’s science and technology policy through its main program, the National System of Researchers (SNI), an attempt made for the first time. The results obtained make it possible to see whether the SNI has succeeded in improving research in Mexico. The authors also look at whether the program provides ways of improving and strengthening the science policy model adopted by Mexico and whether it could be extended and/or introduced into other nearby countries with levels of development or characteristics similar to those of Mexico. Design/methodology/approach – After that, the authors will analyze the scientific productivity of SNI members in comparison to Mexican researchers as a whole so as to assess both whether the SNI selects the best researchers and whether these researchers carry out more research and of a higher quality. Finally, the authors will check whether the selection criteria of the assessment committees are internally consistent. To do this, the authors will carry out a bibliometric analysis of Mexican scientific production (overall and specifically of SNI members) and an analysis of the groups of researchers belonging to the SNI. Findings – The aim of this paper is to discover the impact and importance of the best program in Mexico as regards research policy, known as the SNI. Analyzing it will, in short, enable the authors to detect whether the program has been of use in improving the investigation potential and capacity for science and technology transfer of the research elite in Mexico; check whether the levels assigned to these researchers within the SNI are justified, based on research indicators (inputs and outputs); and assess the pros and cons of the SNI program with an eye to reviewing it in Mexico. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of using cross-sectional data is that information is not the same in each period analyzed. However, the SNI of Mexico has used the same information in all its evaluations. Therefore, the authors believe that using longitudinal data allows us to compare the evolution of SNI for various periods. This certainly is helpful for making decisions and, above all, provides first-hand information to the authorities who, in turn, should strengthen and make more efficient remedial measures regarding public policies on science and technology in Mexico. Practical implications – SNI assessment program will know the science and technology of Mexico and whether it is advisable to implement this program of science policy in similar economies or the same level of development as Mexico. Social implications – The contributions of this study are relevant to the extent that the evaluation system of researchers from Mexico is the basis for allocating research resources, making proposals to help improve the system for evaluating researchers and contributing to efficiency in the allocation of resources for research. Originality/value – This paper has also applied different techniques that have made it possible to look more thoroughly into the classification of all the researchers who were assessed positively by the SNI for period 1996-2003. These techniques have enabled us to obtain alternative classifications based on statistical algorithms and to gauge the level of internal consistency of the classifications made by the SNI, based strictly on the quantitative information supplied. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this research is to identify how the management of university institutes can be improved through adoption of an integrated performance measurement system based on the Balanced Scorecard. Design/methodology/approach: Through building on literature studies and management best practice, formulation of the performance measurement system was explored. The Balanced Scorecard solution was then designed and implemented at a university institute. Benefits and outcomes are discussed through reflective analysis of the case study investigation. Findings: The study identified how the development of scorecard reports that include economic and non-economic measures can improve the operational management of a university institute through providing tangible benefits to stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The scorecard was investigated at an industry-supported university institute and so features of the scorecard design and implementation may be less relevant to other types of organisations. Practical implications: This research paper provides details on how the scorecard has been modified to provide an accessible and durable measurement system. The paper includes specific guidance for practitioners who are considering implementing the scorecard. Social implications: The role of intellectual capital and soft measures as systemic determinants of performance is discussed and this is viewed in terms of university-industry collaborations. Originality/value: A comprehensive literature review underpins a two-year research project involving strategy mapping, design and implementation of the Balanced Scorecard. Advice on modification of the scorecard and provision of representative data and information from reports serve to further the scorecard research agenda. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Owners make several important project delivery decisions in early planning and design phases of a project that impact project performance. Ideally, these decisions should be based on objective consideration and empirical evidence, but they are frequently based on an owner's level of comfort or prior experience. Due to the importance of making informed decisions, several academic studies have investigated the relationship between project performance and potential predictive variables including delivery method, contract type and procurement strategy. Many of these earlier studies have begun losing relevancy in a changing industry, through the introduction of new concepts such as team integration, teaming tools, building information modeling (BIM) and sustainable design. To address this growing knowledge gap, a study was conducted to: (1) identify key project success criteria from the owner's perspective; (2) determine suitable metrics for reliably measuring performance outcomes related to the established success criteria; and (3) consider new concepts such as project integration, BIM, team behavior and sustainability. The research team conducted an extensive literature review on studies exploring the relationship between project delivery and outcomes to generate a comprehensive listing of statistically relevant predictors of success and tested performance metrics. Validation of this compiled listing was performed through an advisory board of industry experts. The advisory board provided critical feedback and assisted in the development a survey instrument for collecting project-specific data. The results of this study will enhance our current understanding of project success criteria and tracking metrics to support decision-making processes. More importantly, it provides a basis for further study, data collection and the creation of a project performance database.

AB  - The growth of the knowledge economy and the changing relationship between science and society, have triggered the emergence of a 'new role' for universities as catalysts for innovation within national innovation policy frameworks. The Triple Helix concept of knowledge generation and innovation introduces triadic relationships between government, academia and industry. These often incorporate state driven aims of innovation development and diffusion for greater societal and economic benefit as conditions of the funding programmes. This concept is witnessed in the UK low carbon energy innovation system, where collaborative relationships are formed to develop new technologies for application by industry and society. The dynamics of the Triple Helix model bring many challenges to policy makers and those engaged in knowledge transfer relationships, stemming from the inherent nature of knowledge and the complex human interactions involved with inter-organisational knowledge transfer. Low carbon innovation has an increased need for inter-disciplinary knowledge transfer where specialised pools of knowledge are brought together for the purposes of innovation, in environments typified by uncertainty and unclear user impacts. Obstacles are compounded by the complexity of defining knowledge transfer processes and the debate surrounding the transferability of knowledge. Significant additional challenges exist within low carbon innovation, where influencing technology adoption by the public is seen as a multifaceted problem with no easy solution and requires innovation outputs to be transformed to societal outcomes. This paper aims to explore the nature of these challenges through a review of the literature on knowledge transfer, the continuing transition of academia, government and industry within knowledge generation frameworks and the specific dilemmas faced by the low carbon innovation system. This literature review provides a foundation for future research which aims to explore the concept of knowledge transfer within the UK low carbon innovation system and gather empirical data pertaining to the optimisation of collaborative project performance.

AB  - Science Parks or Technology Parks (STPs) have been emerging as an strategy based on diverse actors (mainly government, academia or industrial associations) willing to promote economic local development through fostering technology and knowledge transfers among academia, well established companies and new technology based firms (NTBFs). Several countries like Korea, Taiwan and Spain have created STPs as a regional development strategy. In Spain almost half of the universities own STPs. Due to its importance for regional development STPs researches have been directed to explore the effects on factors performance such as Leadership, Strategy, Relations with higher education institutions and other knowledge generators, management, facilities management, staff and organizational structure, development stage and management. Previous analyses refers parks in developed countries and they are in mature development stages. The phenomenon of STPs in Colombia arises in the late 90s and their most development stage of its parks is incubation stage. Colombian STPs have not had a typical development process and the lessons learned of their development have had low levels of documentation in the scientific literature. In this paper, we report our experience in analysis of lessons learned of Colombian STP development process and includes lessons deriving depth analysis of the experiences of the Antioquia and Guatiguará parks. This search is oriented on mixed research approach and the case study methodology was selected due to the emerging nature of the subject within the scientific literature and limited information about the Colombian STPs. This work is a multiple case study based on the five STPs recognized by Colombian STPs Policy. Colombian STPs are surveyed in order to identify lessons learned and the survey was based on written questionnaires followed by semi-structured phone interviews to each park top managers. Interviews include STPs founders, managers and consultants involved in the development of feasibility studies of Colombian STPs projects and initiatives. This multiple case study considers the application of the following techniques: (i) written questionnaires, (ii) semi-structured interviews (iii) content analysis and (iv) structural analysis. Results include a literature review-based description of lessons learned, and the lessons effects on Colombian STPs' development from their leaders' perspective. There were reported more than 22 lessons learned reported by the administration of the surveyed STPs. However in this work we present only the 11 lessons that we verified by interviews and visits. We classify identified lessons according to previously identified factors. The discussion of the results contrasts lessons identified in Colombian STPs versus those reported in other countries.

AB  - Requirements of the industry are reflected into the curricula of the universities oriented to application oriented sciences. Nevertheless, a coordination of the teaching contents to the industrial requirements often does not work efficiently enough because, on the one hand, the dynamism of the changes of the useful teaching contents becomes sluggish at the universities compared with the industry, on the other hand it often does not come to the desired long-term collaboration between universities and industrial companies. In this work different collaboration examples are presented. Also the state of the art of a successful collaboration and the further development of certification program between university and a next-door international enterprise in Cologne, Germany, in the domain of the Electro-CAD application are presented. Special look is give on the technical part of data exchange management. Some examples of such collaboration in the everyday practice at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences by use of the E-learning systems ILIAS and EPLAN Electric P8 software are presented. © 2015 MIPRO.

AB  - Despite the flurry of scholarly research on champions, no prior article has explicitly addressed how different dimensions of championship behavior actually contribute to innovation success. In this article, based on an extensive literature review, the authors argue that champions display four behaviors, namely (1) pursuing innovative ideas, (2) network building, (3) persisting under adversity, and (4) taking responsibility for the idea. The authors use data from 123 university spin-offs to test proposed linear and curvilinear relationships between the four behaviors and an objective measure of innovation success, namely a longitudinal measure of sales growth. The results indicate that network building has the desired positive relationship with sales performance. Surprisingly, pursuing the innovative idea is not related to sales growth. Furthermore, the present study also reveals some dysfunctional effects of champion behaviors. Persisting under adversity and taking responsibility have the hypothesized inverted-U relationship with sales growth. The present study provides a more refined discussion of the benefits and dangers of championing behaviors. Our results show that linking technology to markets can be planned and controlled only to a very limited extent even if champions are working hard to sell the idea to potential customers. Moreover, any new idea is often competing with existing products and pursuing such ideas may result in opposition to the idea. In contrast, network building has the desired positive relationship with innovation success. Effective championing behavior keeps an innovative idea alive by mobilizing support and building coalitions around the idea with critical individuals or important third parties. Moreover, this study challenges the widespread "heroic" discussion of championing as fundamentally positive "across the board." The results show that persisting under adversity and taking responsibility are desirable up to some levels. Beyond such critical levels, these two champion behaviors may actually become detrimental to the innovation process. Being too persistent in the face of adversity or taking too much responsibility for the innovative idea might undermine the power of the champion's justifications for an innovation and thereby increase resistance to change. An "over-performing" champion may interpret opposing communications as an unwarranted and injurious response. By taking overmuch responsibility for the innovative undertaking, the champion is likely to discourage contributions from other team members who see no valuable opportunity to bring their expertise and knowledge to the idea. © 2011 Product Development & Management Association.

AB  - The state of the art of the second-generation of solar cells based on the CdTe and CuInGaSe2 thin film technology will be described. This type of cells reached, on laboratory scale, photovoltaic conversion efficiencies respectively of 16.5% and 20.3% very close to those obtained with bulk materials. In particular, the materials, the layer sequences and deposition techniques used for the preparation of these two absorbers are described. Particular emphasis will be placed on major innovations that have enabled us to achieve high efficiencies with polycrystalline materials, showing how thin-film technology is mature enough to be transferred to industrial production. Finally, we will discuss about a project of technology-transfer developed at Parma University for the production of photovoltaic modules at an industrial level. In the near future, with our process, Arendi S.p.A. will reach a productivity of 18 MW/year. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Technology Centres (TCs) are non-profit organisations created to contribute to the improvement of the productive sector, providing RTD support, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given TCs’ main function, most authors present an industrial perspective of their performance. However, the bibliometric techniques can offer not only an overview of these centres, but also additional information about their features: the evolution of their publications, the degree of national and international collaboration, the Spanish institutional sectors and the main disciplines involved, the regional differences and their connections. In this article, Spanish TCs’ documents downloaded from the Web of Science (2008–2012) are analysed, along with other indicators that can characterise these centres. The results show that national collaboration is important for TCs and even more when those links are local. This is in line with that stated by other authors, considering that geographical proximity is essential for knowledge transfer. Regarding the Spanish institutional sectors, the strongest relations are established with universities. For their part, firms have low participation in publications, although they show an upward trend over the years. Nevertheless, TCs’ documents are mainly issued on industrial related topics, in agreement with their primary mission as promoters of firms’ innovation. Finally, as expected, differences between regions’ performance are seen, explained in part by disparities between regional systems. Notwithstanding, top producers establish connections with regions without TCs, mainly collaborating in documents related to engineering, medicine and environmental topics. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The entrepreneurial university is regarded as an agent of societal change and an important instrument in the facilitation of the contemporary knowledge-based economy because it supports the generation and exploitation of knowledge through its three missions of education, research and academic entrepreneurship. Moreover, the entrepreneurial university boosts economic and social development by encouraging academic entrepreneurship among faculty members. Although research on the entrepreneurial university has increased considerably in recent years, there are as yet no conceptual syntheses of the literature and there is an absence of a holistic framework covering the range of factors required to promote academic entrepreneurship within the entrepreneurial university paradigm. This gap is addressed by identifying the determining factors in an entrepreneurial university and synthesizing them into an integrative framework, based on the corporate entrepreneurship research stream: the determining factors are divided into three groups – external, internal and strategic. This framework is based on a qualitative review of theoretical and empirical studies of entrepreneurial universities and an analysis of diverse frameworks and models. The paper thus provides a systematic overview that allows for consolidation of the literature on entrepreneurial universities, while drawing important implications from research and suggesting potential paths for future study. © 2014, © 2014 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Central America (CA) is geographically located to the south of Mexico and north of the South American continent, with a population of 30 million people and less than 600,000 square kilometers of area. The region is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean and includes these countries: Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The last two countries are the most developed. Panama is widening the canal and constructing thousands of new buildings and financial areas. Costa Rica has the largest microchip plant in the world (Intel) and competes internationally for high-technology industries (HP, Dell, pharmaceuticals, etc.) and service companies. Research and specifications for asphalt materials were very limited until the year 2000. The reason was that each country reduced their efforts in adopting AASHTO specifications for penetration and viscosity graded asphalt. The Marshall Design procedure was the only methodology used for designing hot-mix asphalt (HMA). The turning point for the asphalt industry was in 2000 when the Central American Manual for Highway and Bridge Construction (CA 2000) adopted the PG grading system and the Superpave method as an option for asphalt binder selection and HMA design. Additionally, in 2002, Costa Rica devoted one-percent of the fuel tax to perform applied research, project auditing, and technology transfer through the Transportation Infrastructure Program (PITRA) of the National Laboratory of Materials of the University of Costa Rica (LanammeUCR). This decision allowed the development of a state-of-the-art laboratory and inviting back to the country Master and PhD graduates to perform the mentioned activities. Today, LanammeUCR has all the Superpave equipment for binders and mixtures, dynamic devices for mechanical characterization of HMA (dynamic modulus, flow number, Hamburg wheel track, Asphalt Pavement Analyzer, beam fatigue), and equipment for materials characterization ranging from nano-scale (AFM, TGA, DSC, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy) to full-scale (a heavy-vehicle simulator, HVS). This investment in equipment and training of personnel made LanammeUCR the regional laboratory for this area. The most important current research lines are focused on developing specifications and material analysis representative of the tropical weather conditions and the weak soil foundation characteristic of the region. Examples of these research projects are: 1) calibration of the Witczak model for Central America's HMA mixtures; 2) development of a new moisture damage test for tropical weather; 3) adaptation of chip and slurry seals for local conditions; 4) nano-characterization of neat and modified asphalt binders; 5) development of fatigue and rutting models for HMA mixtures; and, 6) the most ambitious project, to develop an empirical-mechanistic pavement design guide for the CA region.

AB  - Despite the wealth of academic studies that analyze different policy measures and initiatives implemented by national or regional governments to support knowledge transfer from academia to industry, scant systematization efforts seek to integrate these disparate lines of research. The systematic review of academic studies on public policy measures in support of technology transfer presented by this article suggests a literature classification based on two dimensions: the type of policy measure analyzed, and the focus of the study (i.e., policy design vs. impact assessment). On the basis of this comprehensive review, we summarize the lessons learned thus far, identify research gaps that continue to limit insights into public policy measures for technology transfer, and highlight directions for further research. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this research is to: 1) discuss and analyze the adaptation of the innovation program in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) through an examination of 8 successful case studies; 2) to identify the innovation indicators in four categories, (i) culture, (ii) policy, (iii) industry, and (iv) economy; and 3) to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of innovation (a SWOT analysis) and their potential use worldwide. Prior Work: The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program (EIP) is a powerful engine for expansion and for addressing societal and global challenges. The innovation drives economic growth and job creation and is of significance not only within high-tech sectors but in all economic sectors. While economists and policymakers worldwide have recognized the importance of technological innovation for growth, the relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship has been especially appreciated recently because entrepreneurs play an important role in fomenting innovation. The results are part of the ongoing research project funded by a grant by Kuwait Foundation for Advancement of Sciences (KFAS-2012-1103-01). Methodology/Approach: The methodology is based on uses a qualitative approach consisting of literature review and eight international interviews in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Results: This paper provides ranking of innovation programs and a set of guidelines and recommendations for future adaptation. Implications: This paper provides value-added knowledge for both academics and practitioners who are interested insuccessful adaptation of EIP.

AB  - University-industry collaboration offers at best great opportunities both for the companies and the universities. Industry will benefit especially in terms of innovative co-creation potential and direct recruitment channel, and the university will benefit in terms of potential hands-on research environment, real-life teaching and learning possibilities and funding opportunities for research. Yet the university-industry engagement is far from easy, due to the varying starting points, aims and modus operandi. This paper examines the role of knowledge transfer in university-industry collaboration basing on the argument that effective knowledge transfer is one of the critical success factors in the collaboration as co-learning and co-creation of value do not happen without appropriate knowledge transfer. The focus of this paper is especially on identifying the knowledge barriers that are present within knowledge networks comprising of universities and their industrial partners. Knowledge networks are networks that have been established for the purpose of knowledge exchange (Verburg and Andriessen, 2011; Nielsen, 2002; llvonen and Vuori, 2013). Universities' role in such networks is often central, as they act as creators, intermediators, nodes, facilitators and resources (Myllärniemi et al, 2013). The paper builds on Riege's (2005) classification that divides the barriers into individual, organizational and technological. All of these categories exist within university-industry knowledge networks, but they are accompanied with specific challenges arising from the different features of academia and business (e.g. non-profit vs. profit, generalisability vs. restricted use of results, long-term scientific theory building vs. quick realisation of innovations). Through the methodologies of literature review and multiple case study the paper presents the KBs that are highlighted within university-industry knowledge networks.

AB  - Objective: The main goal of the article is to discuss and elaborate on the basics foundations of the concept of accountability in terms of public universities management. Research Design & Methods: The article is of descriptive character, based on literature review and its constructive critics. Findings: The article presents the concept of entrepreneurial university to relate this idea to develop the accountability practices in higher education. Subsequently, the limitations of trends related to the development of the entrepreneurial university and accountability are discussed. Implications & Recommendations: Higher education is increasingly becoming a business operation, in which competition plays a key role. Accountability at universities is established to implement a specific accounting and reporting system, which is a prerequisite for the existence of this accountability and responsibility. Accounting of higher education systems is a consequence of the marketization of universities. Contribution & Value Added: The article assembles the scientific developments in four main fields, namely (i) entrepreneurial university, (ii) university accountability, (iii) accounting and autonomy of universities, (iv) measures of university performance. © 2016, Cracow University of Economics.

AB  - Objectives: This study reports on the development of a critical process for health technologies incorporation concerning an Argentinean Provincial Ministry of Health (MOH) in collaboration with the University of Lanús from 2008 to 2010. Methods: We describe the approach developed to adapt selected international experiences to provincial scenario. Bibliographic review, regulations examination, key informants interviews and iterative adjustments after various stages of consultation and consensus building with main local players, contribution from foreign experts, and piloting of process and instruments for ultimate fine-tuning are described. We examine final proposal in the light of new updated studies. Results: Analysis of regulations revealed that rules governing the provincial system were historically linked to administrative resolutions in relation to procurement with poor consideration to clinical, epidemiological, organizational, and health policy aspects. Key informants from hospitals, MOH, and other governmental agencies agreed on the lack of a process capable of guaranteeing a decision about health technology incorporation based on a transparent use of the best available information, ready to deal with competitive pressures. This adaptation provided a structured and explicit process (introduction, implementation, and development) as well as essential and supporting tools. Conclusions: MOH adopted the proposal for its progressive implementation while institutional evaluation capacity develops. Further studies are needed on the value placed on health technology assessment-based processes and recommendations by clinicians, managers, policy makers, and patients. © Cambridge University Press 2014.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to contribute learning, knowledge creation and knowledge transfer obtained through a web-based role-play simulation environment as an intelligent approach towards organisational change. Such change occurs in the organisation during its transition to a new version of the ISO 9001:2015. Design/methodology/approach-This paper is based on a literature review and the experience of the authors and a team of international teaching and research staff, as well as on information obtained from satisfaction surveys. Findings-The actual version of the web-based Management System Role-Play Simulation (MS-RPS) considers the changes in structure and terminology of the ISO management system standards, enables the creation of a predictive strategy regarding organisational culture, minimises the negative impact of the change and helps people adapt more quickly to it. Research limitations/implications-The study is limited to the complexity of an actual system and the possible verification of empirical results. Another limitation is the measurability of any real enhancement achieved in the quality, safety and sustainability of production, as well as the business continuity and social responsibility of an organisation. Practical implications-One benefit of the training is the thorough knowledge that players within organisational management can gain in a short period. Reduced resistance to change is also stressed and the complexity and dynamism of the internal environment considered. Originality/value-MS-RPS is based on original web-based software. The primary model has been developed at the Technical University of Kosice. It was tested by students, but also by managers and other employees in several industrial organisations, as well as services, over 20 years. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this paper we use a network perspective to study the micro level of agricultural innovation systems and investigate the different roles and functions that collaborating actors have to perform to spread their innovation both horizontally and vertically. Based on a literature review, we distinguish between three separate network functions: (1) learning and knowledge co-creation, (2) upscaling and institutional entrepreneurship and (3) outscaling and innovation brokerage.We investigate how these different functions have been performed in the case of the Northern Frisian Woodlands (NFWs) in the Netherlands over a period of 17. years. We have constructed the two-mode affiliation networks of the actors involved in various multidisciplinary research projects and lobbying events. We have analysed these networks using Social Network Analysis and measured the participation rates, relative degrees and the main paths through time with the Search Path Node Pairs algorithm.The results show that the three functions are not evenly distributed over all participants in an innovation network. For each of these three functions there is a small group of people that form a core group of knowledge creators, institutional entrepreneurs and innovation brokers. The analysis of the main paths through these projects and events shows the close interaction between the lobbying and knowledge co-creation functions.The ability to perform more than one innovation function over a longer period of time is extremely rare, but those people who can pull this off are very important for the success of an innovation network. This paper therefore concludes that the organisers of innovation networks should take try to organise their collaboration in such a way that it becomes easier for individuals to perform multiple roles within an innovation network. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Low-power and high-temperature sensors and MEMS designs based on bulk, SOI and IC compatible materials and processes are presented here. Target markets are in general public sensors for UV, ozone, CO, liquids presence, e.g. in mobile devices. Or in health, sensors for the medical diagnosis (DNA, RNA, bacteria, viruses). Simple, low cost and low consumption devices are required in medical applications. In our laboratory aluminum oxide interdigitated capacitors have been developed and successfully tested on DNA hybridization test on HIV and cancer (TP-53), as well as on bacteria and humidity or condensation (integrated into a wireless breathing monitoring system), all of them showing comparable results to the state of the art using existing standard biological protocols procedures that open new opportunities for Medical Applications. For UV light based detections (UV Diode), that are ready for use, packaging must be customized. Customers are the kits fabricator to integrate our device for a fast electrical measurement (for DNA concentration, turbidity or fire detection). Our technology demonstrates high-performance CMOS integrated circuits; easy integration of special devices, sensors and MEMS; operation in harsh conditions (micro power, high-temperature, remote RF link, etc.); very low power consumption, miniaturized, wireless or high-temperature sensors for process control, monitoring and data acquisition. Furthermore, our devices deliver excellent performance compared to the state of the art. It is important to note that this article resumes some of our results from previous papers (see the references). More information can be found in the university website (www.dice.ucl.ac.be) or in www.sensoi.net. in a more commercial way.

AB  - The phenomenon of entrepreneurial universities has received considerable attention over the last decades. An entrepreneurial orientation by academia can lead to innovative and sustainable products and research mobilization which help in putting regions and nations in an advantageous position in emerging knowledge-intensive fields of economic activity. Many empirical researches focused on entrepreneurial orientation of university students, but study on antecedents and criteria of the entrepreneurial universities is scarce. The main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive criteria set for evaluation of entrepreneurial universities. In this context, environmental and internal factors of entrepreneurial universities were identified based on literature review and survey. Twelve academics and managers have participated in this study by weighing the criteria and scoring alternatives. Society, in particular, higher education institutions, and universities can use the results for creation of new businesses and spin-offs. Data was analyzed by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS). © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine organizational cross-culture differences in public-private research-oriented relationships. More precisely, it focusses on the analysis university-industry collaborations partnering for research agreements with the aim of fostering the transfer of knowledge and innovation. It analyzes the key organizational cross-cultural differences that could hinder the successful performance of these agreements from a relationship marketing (RM) perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a comprehensive literature review of organizational culture and RM, a quantitative study was carried out and a structural equation model was proposed and tested. Findings - Cross-cultural organizational differences in private-public sectors are proved to negatively influence relationship performance. Market orientation difference appears as the most significant barrier to relationship performance, followed by time orientation difference and to a lesser extent flexibility difference. Originality/value - By integrating organizational culture and RM literatures, the main contribution of this paper is the cross-cultural analysis of private-public relationships (in this case university-industry relationships) from the perspective of RM. Hence, this research will inform management seeking to develop successful public-private collaborations by enhancing their understanding of cross-cultural factors underlying relationship success and failure. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper describes the lessons learned during the first phases of the "Fly Your Satellite!" (FYS) CubeSat programme carried out by the Education Office of the European Space Agency (ESA). Within the FYS framework, the ESA Education Office supports university teams to conduct the verification campaign of their CubeSat, in order to introduce them to methods and best practices commonly used in ESA and other space agency programmes, with two main objectives: first of all, offer the students an important educational opportunity to perform the verification of their satellite with the support of ESA specialists, and also of improving student teams' mission success chances. Support for the launch opportunity will be offered to those teams which demonstrate their CubeSat's flight worthiness based on the review of their design, thorough testing, and of their verification documentation. The FYS programme offers to the participating student teams the possibility to have their work supervised by ESA specialists thus facilitating knowledge transfer from experienced professionals to students. Besides, CubeSat teams are able to access state of the art test facilities for the environmental tests campaign (vibrations and thermal vacuum). FYS is structured in 4 phases: the programme started with the Flight Model (FM) integration, and will continue up to the beginning of the mission operations. The participating teams are requested to provide to ESA their CubeSat design and testing documentation, for review by ESA specialists, and must comply with the international regulations applicable to spacecraft registration and space debris mitigation guidelines. The first two phases of "Fly Your Satellite!" focused on the review of the design, and on the preparation and conduct of the functional and environmental test campaigns, in both laboratory and space representative conditions. Throughout the first two phases of the programme, a number of issues as well as good practices were identified in almost all aspects of CubeSat projects from project management, to technical design (including testing campaigns), to compliance with international regulations. The experience gained during FYS Phases 1 and 2 as well as the previous small satellite programmes of the Education Office, enables the authors to indicate several lessons learned that are presented in this paper, with the aim of helping student teams and professors/researchers which are considering to engage in small-satellite development projects. In particular it is aimed at those teams that are willing to develop their spacecraft taking into account aspects of "good engineering practice", with the intention to include in the development a suitable verification campaign of the design requirements and by such, increasing the confidence in the success of their mission.

AB  - Commercialisation of the university researches and innovations is an integral part of a knowledge based institution. Thereby, due to the importance of commercialisation, certain institutions are working to speed up the diffusion process and technology transfer of new technology or new products or new services. In the world of globalization, universities are required to get involved in activities to commercialize university research and innovations to industries. It’s important that all activities and organizational structures related to commercialisation of academic research should be managed in a way which should increase commercialisation with minimum negative effect on education and research. It’s also desirable that it should also improve university’s overall capacity to perform different functions. The above mentioned facts make commercialisation of academic research a big challenge for university. The most of work highlights the relevance of collaborative research, contract research, consulting and informal relationships for university – industry knowledge transfer. We present a systematic review of research on academic scientists’ involvement in these activities to which we refer as ‘university research’. © 2015, Czestochowa University of Technology.

AB  - China became the second-largest economy behind the USA in 2010. While there is quite some macroeconomic research documenting the technological catching-up of China as a nation, there is only little research studying how individual Chinese firms are catching up. This paper draws on the open innovation perspective to explore how Chinese firms improve their innovative performance. Our empirical analysis is based on a sample of 91 native Chinese firms in high-tech industries. The results indicate that Chinese firms widely implement an open innovation approach to strengthen their innovative performance. These firms use: 1 technology in-licensing agreements to obtain access to technologies 2 long-term alliances with foreign partners to access state-of-the-art technologies 3 collaboration with local universities and R&D institutes to broaden their technological strengths 4 collaboration with the local industrial community to deepen their technological skills.

AB  - Purpose: We propose in this paper to analyze what are the factors that influence knowledge transfer both intra and intergenerational in family firms. The main objective is to establish a framework that can be used later in empirical research, although we maintain a completely theoretical approach in this paper Design/methodology/approach: This study, which is a comprehensive framework characterized the knowledge transfer literature in family firms in terms of the factors influencing them, was developed by an extensive literature review. Findings: Based on an extensive literature review, we conclude that knowledge is best transferred when family members value the following factors: trust between family members, commitment to the family business, intergenerational relationships, intragenerational relationships, psychological ownership of the family business, successor's aspects and training, predecessor involvement in the successor training, organizational culture and relationships with Family Business Associations. Research limitations/implications: The study demonstrates the extensiveness and variety of knowledge transfer research. However there is not the same situation in family firms' field. For academics, these different factors can be used as a map for future empirical studies. Originality/value: There is a notable lack of research into knowledge practices in small and medium-sized enterprises and especially in family firms. Besides, there is a gap in the understanding of an effective way to transfer these resources across generations; actually, existing studies on knowledge management in family businesses are scarce. The main value of our paper is to fill out partially this gap.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how sports science was institutionalised and rapidly deinstitutionalised within a Premier League football club. Institutional theory has been critiqued for its lack of responsiveness to change, but recent developments within institutional theory such as the focus on deinstitutionalisation as an explanation of change, the role of institutional entrepreneurs and the increasing interest in institutional work facilitate exploration of change within institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors deploy a longitudinal case study which ran from 2003-2011. Data was collected via observations, semi-structured interviews and through extensive literature reviews. Findings: Via this longitudinal case study, the authors illustrate that the antecedents of deinstitution can lie in the ways by which an institution is established. In doing so, they highlight the paradoxical role potentially played by institutional entrepreneurs in that they can (unwittingly) operate as agents of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation. Their study suggests that the higher the performance imperative within a field, the more likely the institution as a generic concept will be deinstitutionalised and the more likely to be appropriated and customised in order to gain inimitability and thus competitive advantage. Finally, the authors make an additional contribution by integrating the affective aspects of institutional work to their analyses; stressing the role played by emotions. Research limitations/implications: As with many case studies, the ability to generalise from one case, however detailed, is limited. However, it provides evidence as to the paradoxical role that can be played by institutional entrepreneurs - especially in highly competitive environments. Practical implications: The study suggests that the HR function has a potential role to play with regards to institutional continuity through a focus on leader and institutional entrepreneur succession planning. Originality/value: The paper makes an original contribution by highlighting both institutional and deinstitutional work within a single case. It highlights the paradoxical nature of institutional entrepreneurs in highly competitive environments and illustrates the importance of emotion to institutional maintenance and deinstitution. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose – The aim of this paper is to discuss how ISO 26000 fits within two predominant corporate social responsibility (CSR) instruments, GRI and UNGC. The past two decades have witnessed considerable changes in the CSR field with the introduction of new voluntary CSR instruments. Organizations adopting such tools may perceive some of the existing and emerging CSR instruments as redundant or complementary. Design/methodology/approach – The relationships between the CSR instruments analysed are treated through the lenses of institutional entrepreneurship and coopetition theories. The analysis presented is based on secondary data such as literature reviews, publications and online resources and databases from the UNGC, GRI and ISO as well as personal communications with representatives of ISO, GRI and UNGC. Findings – The paper shows that from the users’ perspective, CSR instruments should not be treated as separate alternatives, but rather as complementary to each other. At the same time, organizations that set up CSR instruments have to strengthen their existing collaboration as a network, in order to contribute more effectively to sustainable development. Research limitations/implications – The use of secondary data to discuss some of the ISO 26000 diffusion trends might provide an incomplete picture but still offer interesting insights. Practical implications – This study allows to better understand the linkages, overlaps and differences between three CSR instruments: UNGC, GRI and ISO 26000. At first sight, some of these instruments may appear as redundant but our analysis point out that they complement each other. They have different goals and are useful in different parts of one organization’s CSR infrastructure. These instruments help organizations to implement different CSR tools at different stages of integrating sustainability issues into their strategies and operations. Originality/value – CSR instruments have mainly been examined separately by scholars. In contrast, this study analyses ISO 26000, UNGC and GRI as a collaborative mechanism and predicts the fit of ISO 26000 within these well-established CSR instruments. The main contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the relationships between organizations that are developing and promoting prominent CSR instruments. In addition, we apply organizational theories to our analysis as a novel perspective. This study contributes to institutional entrepreneurship theory by showing how organizations playing the role of institutional entrepreneurs may encourage the early adoption of a new CSR instrument. It also contributes to the coopetition theory by applying this approach outside the traditional business setting. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Whereas political science has a long history in the higher-education provision of many countries, it was only in the early 1970s that it became a feature of the provision in Austria. Not only is Austria a latecomer to the political science profession, but it is also home to a rather small political science community with there only being three universities which have established political science departments: Innsbruck, Salzburg and Vienna. Today two university political science departments have mainstreamed gender into their curriculum, with this being the result of the success of feminist entrepreneurs in these departments. The provision at the University of Vienna is typified by one where professors, associates and external lecturers contribute to the curriculum in gender political science. This state of affairs is, however, far from secure as the Bologna process, the transformation toward an entrepreneurial university as well as budget cuts challenge these institutionalizations. This article seeks to explain this mixed picture through an analysis of the recent state of the art of teaching and gender research in Austrian political science before proceeding to point out the favorable factors which fostered the establishment of gender studies in Political Science. Finally, the article builds on the recent challenging conditions which jeopardizes gender studies within the discipline. © 2016 European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - Strategic alliances provide companies with a mechanism for enhanced knowledge transfer leading to improved products, and for universities, there can be access to sustainable funding sources for research. However, certain challenges exist in developing and managing these alliances, including contractual agreements being fit for purpose and ensuring academic research is relevant to industrial requirements. Following a literature review, a management framework has been developed that is based on the need for alignment between companies and universities in three core areas, namely technical, commercial and social. This alignment mechanism will be explored through a case study investigation of a strategic alliance between a university and an industrial organization. Findings include a need for a robust commercial approach including management of intellectual property; alliance governance arrangements and performance measurement; management across boundaries; and the importance of companies' absorptive capacity.

AB  - Europe is highly competitive when it comes to developing new knowledge, but it is less successful at turning this knowledge into the innovative products and services that drive world class economies. The EU wants Europe to become a more innovationfriendly continent and is currently working on a new strategy to create an "Innovation Union". This LERU paper presents the views of some of Europe's leading research-intensive universities (RIUs) as a contribution to the development of the EU strategy and the initiatives that will follow from it. Research-intensive universities, as the bedrock of internationally competitive, cutting edge research and an attraction pole for a vast and dynamic pool of talented researchers, have an important role to play in the Innovation Union. However, in recent decades their research efforts have been impoverished, with some notable exceptions, in comparison with other systems because of marginal-cost funding of research, the allocation of research funding on criteria other than excellence, and an obsession with bureaucratic even-handedness. The EU can help universities flourish by developing or promoting processes and infrastructures that stimulate and enable creativity. Efforts should be focused on five objectives: 1) stimulating excellence by investing heavily and wisely in competitive, frontier, undirected research; 2) attracting and nurturing the best talents for research of each generation; 3) creating a barrier-free space for European researchers to move around in; 4) ensuring the development of and access to major, state-of-the-art research infrastructures; 5) orchestrating collaboration in globally significant research programmes. When it comes to creating an environment that allows innovation to flourish, universities play an important enabling role in the innovation chain. RIUs in particular are hubs of creativity which attract research-intensive companies and investment into a region and help to catalyse innovation in local businesses. They have developed strong technology transfer offices (TTOs) that act as entrepreneurial hubs throughout the entire innovation network around RIUs. Within the university, TTOs are not just the centrepiece of the university's third mission operations. Because of the cognitive and financial spillovers that TTOs generate, their activities interweave across the first and second missions of research-intensive universities. If universities are to be more effective in enabling and catalysing innovation in Europe, action is required under three broad headings that reflect the interaction between supply and demand. We suggest that these should be the priorities for the university component in a European innovation union. These headings are 1) enhancing supply of relevant university capacity, 2) stimulating business demand and 3) improving university-business interactions. While universities in general and RIUs in particular play an important role in the innovation chain, they do not operate in isolation but are instead part of a larger innovation ecosystem. There are fundamentally four different, but interacting forces at work in driving innovation. These driving forces are: 1) competitively driven research, 2) dynamic entrepreneurship, 3) competitive, fair market environments and 4) adequate financial resources. We propose that the EU's efforts to create a better innovation-friendly environment should consist of a four-pronged attack aimed at stimulating these four driving forces and that they should focus on the combination and interaction of these forces. © 2010 Published by LERU.

AB  - Companies across different industrial sectors collaborate with universities in order to secure a knowledge advantage and benefit from technology transfer opportunities. This subject has been studied widely yet there is very little coverage of how to develop knowledge management strategies in this context. Following a literature review a knowledge management framework will be developed that includes the generation, capture, communication and application of knowledge. The framework will be explored through a case study investigation of a major collaborative programme between a UK university and an industrial company. The case study involved reflective analysis of how the knowledge management strategy was formulated and delivered to support the collaboration and also how performance was measured holistically across the collaborative programme. Findings point to the non-linear nature of collaboration and the merit in viewing knowledge flows from an integrated systems perspective. Copyright, American Society for Engineering Management, 2012.

AB  - There is a widely held view that the performance of firms depends not only on the ability of managers to exploit economic markets but also on their ability to succeed in political markets. To test the value of political activism, recent scholarship has probed the impact of corporate political activity (CPA) on firm performance. However, mixed findings and the fragmented nature of the field raise more questions than answers as to the nature of this relationship. This systematic review examines scholarly articles for evidence of the impact of CPA on firm value. The findings suggest that CPA is more valuable in emerging countries and that relational CPA strategies are more common in emerging (versus developed) countries where social capital underlies political and economic exchange. We also document the paucity of research on informational CPA strategies and policy outcomes in the emerging country context. We consider the implications of these findings and others for local and multinational enterprises, and offer suggestions for further research. © 2014.

AB  - Numerous studies and reviews about University Knowledge Transfer Offices (UKTO) have been written, but there are few that focus on Social Responsibility (SR). We present a systematic review of the research on both fields. We consider not only logics from agency theory and resource-based view, but also the dynamic approach from institutional theory, as they aim to generate sustainable economic and social value. The evolution of Knowledge Transfer Offices depends on their role as brokers of collaborations among different stakeholders, according to their mission and capacity to confront the innovation gap. We follow the line of SR viewed as a response to the specific demands of large stakeholders. Building upon recent conceptualizations of different theories, we develop an integrative model for understanding the institutional effects of the UKTO on university social responsibility. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Knowledge management in offshore outsourcing projects is a very important topic, but this area of research has got limited academic attention leading to lack of studies exist on the management of both client's and service provider's knowledge for developing embedded software. The main goal of this study is to fill in this gap by analyzing client's generic and specific knowledge as well as the service provider's generic and specific knowledge and how this knowledge could be effectively managed in this endeavor. We conducted an extensive literature review on the major topics related to this field. From the analysis, an integrative model of knowledge management for embedded software development through offshore outsourcing is developed which deals with both parties' generic and specific knowledge. We posit that through the provision of adequate training, where outsourcing client takes the main responsibilities in planning and conducting what kind of distinctive knowledge types should be delivered to service provider and how it should be performed, it is possible to facilitate effective knowledge transfer and management for the development of high quality embedded software through offshore outsourcing. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this paper is to identify the role of factors influencing the development of technological entrepreneurship using as example a company with academic origin in the IT sector. The scientific purpose of the study is to compile the views of scholars on technological entrepreneurship. Research Design & Methods: The first part of the study is of descriptive character and based on literature review, while the second part is empirical. The application of the empirical method of a case study has made it possible to characterize the essence of technological entrepreneurship and illustrate the development of the studied phenomenon in business practice. Findings: The concept of technological entrepreneurship is based on increasing innovation, new assets and competitiveness through more efficient use of research results leading to development of products and services. The process of creating technological entrepreneurship is conditioned largely by endogenous factors of organizations and also by the business ecosystem. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to further develop current theory of technological entrepreneurship through discussion on the methodological dilemmas associated with conducting research in this area. Contribution & Value Added: The article is an attempted synthesis of the concept of technological entrepreneurship as a process that combines the elements of academic and intellectual entrepreneurship with the entrepreneurship of commercial organizations implementing new technologies and innovative business solutions in the market environment. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

AB  - The effectiveness of an engineering curriculum is measured by how well students can apply and integrate their technical knowledge to solve real life problems. The current engineering curriculum has been designed to only to provide the theory, however, it doesn't provide the integration of how this knowledge can be applied. The courses that are taken as preparation for system engineering students include standard mechanical studies such as statics, dynamics, and structural analysis, but also, computer software and hardware courses that study C programming, circuit analysis and electronics. These types of collegiate engineering classes that are taken on a general level in all system engineering disciplines, are supposed to provide the theory that is needed to build a system; however, they do not teach the tools that are needed to know how to integrate these concepts together during the system development process. The downfall reflects in the student when they cannot develop a successful senior design project. As a solution, a state-of-the-art education is being presented as a project-based learning experience. This type of educational method has been designed to push motivated students into a fast pace, learn as you "build" environment in which students need to integrate educational theory with applications. While not being a requirement by the university, a directed independent study was performed by a junior level student in the summer of 2010. The objective of the study was to apply compartmentalized knowledge obtained from previous technical courses, such as circuits, logic design, and engineering mathematics, to design and build an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), given a set of requirements. At the end of this project, the student was evaluated in terms of his technical and educational accomplishments: the ASV was successfully built that met the given requirements, and the student has demonstrated a deeper understanding of how to apply and integrate educational knowledge to solve a real-life problem. The outcome of this project is a needed experience for any engineering scholar. It provides a stepping stone from the collegiate environment to professional development, while linking the integration of educational knowledge with practical design tactics. We envision that this type of project can be implemented effectively as a regular course so students can learn hands-on experience in system engineering design that cannot be found in a text book. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - Purpose: Literature shows that university spin-offs (USOs) have idiosyncratic strengths in comparison to other new firms; however, evidence also shows that Chinese USOs have a low survival rate, and only a small percent of them can grow into sustainable businesses. The purpose of this paper is to conduct an empirical study to inquire about the variable growth barriers to Chinese USOs, in order to address two major research questions of this paper: what are the major growth barriers, and how significant they are; and what supports should university and government provide to eliminate those barriers? Design/methodology/approach: In the first place, this paper attempts to explore the research questions through literature review and pilot interviews, based on which, a questionnaire for a survey was developed. Then, this study then attempts to address the research questions through a nation-wide survey in 2009 across 69 national university science parks. Findings: This paper finds that corporate governance issues, managerial concerns, and lack of infrastructure support are three major categories of barriers that thwart the growth of USOs in China. In addition, this paper also identified the support that is expected from universities and government agencies in order to cope with the barriers. Originality/value: This paper contributes to theory in three ways. First, it tests and validates some existing conceptual frameworks concerned with the growth barriers to USOs. Second, it sheds light on the specific growth concerns of Chinese USOs and identifies three kinds of barriers. Further, this study provides evidence for future policy making regarding USOs and university technology transfer activities in China. This research will be of interest to policy makers, academic entrepreneurs, and university administrators. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Most research suggests that nonprofit organizations (NPOs) should professionalize in order to become more efficient. Yet, a growing body of literature emphasizes the importance of preserving some of their original grassroots culture. Based on a qualitative meta-analysis of 19 in-depth cases from the past decade, our integrative model contributes to this debate in three important ways: first, we suggest that most NPO pathways of development are characterized by the acquisition of a dual nature i.e., a community setting a value-based mission (stage 1) and a professional structure involving formal and centralized coordination aimed at effectiveness (stage 2); second, that this dual system often leads NPOs to an existential crisis characterized by contradiction and indetermination (stage 3); and third, that this indetermination constitutes a window of opportunity for deciders to more deliberately arbitrate the orientation adopted by their NPOs (stage 4). We discuss the role of deciders, beyond institutional pressures, to explain why the nonprofit sector is still relatively diverse. We propose voluntarism and institutional entrepreneurship as important mainstays of nonprofitness. © 2014, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.

AB  - The emergence of the Web 2.0 created new opportunities for knowledge transfer between University - Industry - Society, such as the crowdsourcing phenomenon which has attracted great attention, and has created new possibilities for knowledge transfer that are still being evaluated. However, much of the existing academic research remains unused and unleveraged after being published, never creating the benefits for society that were expected from both the effort that was put in to produce it and the cost that was supported to allow for the research. This paper seeks to present a critical literature review evaluating the existing knowledge transfer mechanisms and pair it with the new possibilities created by Internet of Things to propose a new knowledge and technology transfer framework between University - Industry - Society that better leverages the usefulness of existing published research and applies it to the creation of new innovative solutions, thus creating an alternative knowledge transfer mechanism. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper discusses stakeholders’ relationships in a service learning project in a rural destination in Ecuador (Mashpi, province of Pichincha). A conceptual framework was developed examining three areas: stakeholder management, tourism development and service learning projects and knowledge transfer. Sixteen (16) stakeholders took part in the case study using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. A thematic analysis was conducted informed by the literature review. The first research theme related to stakeholders’ objectives, roles and perceptions about the involvement of other stakeholders. The second theme includes all the strategic management issues concerning the tourism development project. This includes issues of transferring knowledge from students and teachers to the community, a feature of service learning projects of this type. Thirdly, the relationships amongst stakeholders are outlined in a Venn diagram. Finally, the hindrances encountered in the projects connected to the other themes are discussed in this paper. The paper concludes that even though the project is found to be beneficial to all stakeholders, including students and teachers, enhancing the academic experience, it is fraught with challenges and several hindrances. One of the challenges is to plan activities in a way that takes into consideration the needs of the community involved in the tourism project, which are not aligned with the university scheduling. Problems of coordination and communication arise from a lack of strong leadership in the management of these projects. This includes a clear understanding of the various roles and responsibilities together with an analysis of the power and legitimacy of each stakeholder. © 2017

AB  - This article gathers some of the most important theoretical and conceptual references, systematized from the review and consultation of specialized literature on university Spin Off, through a documentary type methodological qualitative process with a tendency to observe closely, afterwards, the capacity that has the University of Cauca, a public Colombian higher education institution, regarding the organization of knowledge to transfer the results generated by its research groups towards the environment, in alliance with entrepreneurs and other groups of interest, where the following analytical categories among others, are highlighted: The evaluation of the diverse typologies presented by well-known experts based on their heterogeneity. The analysis of different organizational models related to this type of entrepreneurships. The factors of success and the failure of some universities Spin Offs. The stages that might have to be exhausted for the successful implementation of this kind of organizations and the basic aspects to be considered in the relationship between University-Firm-State. As closure, it is suggested that for all legal purposes, a university Spin-Off in Colombia is "a company based on knowledge, especially the one protected by rights of Intellectual Property, created in the area of the Higher Education Institution (HEI), as a result of research and development activities conducted under their support, in their laboratories and facilities or by researchers who are linked to them, among others" (Law 1838, Act of 2017). © 2019 ASERS Publishing.

AB  - The impact of corruption on entrepreneurial dynamics became an attractive topic for scholars after the appearance of public scandals that led to the delegitimization of many governments in the last 40 years. The research that explored the relationship between corruption and entrepreneurship has produced controversial results. It appears that the interaction of these two constructs is influenced by contextual factors both at an individual and national level of analysis. By using a bibliometric methodology and a fractional counting method to analyse the scientific literature on corruption and entrepreneurship, this paper identifies and analyses 180 articles recorded in the Scopus database. It represents a contribution by showing the state of the art of research on corruption and entrepreneurship and proposes future lines of research. Important results have been found about the evolution of the volume of articles and citations on this topic over time. Significant academic interest in this field commenced in the 21st century, and more specifically in the last ten years. This work also provides findings about the most prolific journals, institutions and authors, as well as the most relevant countries, with the United States and United Kingdom leading in terms of the number of publications. In addition, an in-depth analysis of authors' keywords has identified different trends, such as institutions, economic growth, shadow economy, regulation, Africa, culture, economic development, business environment, and informal economy. Finally, some future research lines are proposed, such as institutional theory, tax morale, corruption perceptions, European regions, risk aversion and institutional entrepreneurship. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

AB  - Academic practitioners need to enlighten their teaching practice by integrating learning theories into their instructional courses. However, traditional educational philosophies such as behaviourism, constructivism, and cognitivism are considered as the foundation of teaching and learning, they do not argue intrinsically as instructional design in the 21st century. Continues evaluation of learning for each generation holds pedagogy in high standard. Learning theories has undergone many changes, and therefore guidance in modern educational theory is important for continues learning. Lifelong learning, rapid development of science and technology principle stimulates educational growth, and requires new learning methodologies. Learning in the 21st century has undergone profound changes, due to an influence in mobile tools and new technologies. The study reviews traditional learning theories, including connectivism with viewpoint for the 21st century using scoping review to probe strengths and weaknesses and produce deductions into knowledge transfer. The study recommends connectivism as a suitable learning theory that allows teaching and learning with technology to be viewed in an optimistic perspective that relate to the ability of positive outcome. © Copyright International Association of Engineers.

AB  - The current integrative literature review explored the impact of interactive delirium care education in facilitating knowledge transfer to health care practitioners and improving health outcomes for older adults. Academic databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science, were searched using the terms delirium and simulation or interactive education. Selected articles were analyzed using Critical Appraisals Skills Programme tools. Twenty studies were reviewed and three themes generated to explain the current understanding of the impact of interactive delirium care education on outcomes for: (a) individuals with delirium; (b) organizational health care; and (c) health care practitioners. The current review demonstrated that interactive education is a promising contemporary approach for raising awareness about best practice delirium care by health care practitioners. Due to gaps in the literature, future educational research in the area of delirium care education needs to adopt a more consistent method of reporting fi ndings to ensure successful transferability across care settings. © SLACK Incorporated.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the abundance of research in open innovation, few contributions explore it at inter-organizational level, and particularly with a focus on healthcare ecosystem, characterized by a dense network of relationships among public and private organizations (hospitals, companies and universities) as well as other actors that can be labeled as “untraditional” player, i.e. doctors, nurses and patients. The purpose of this paper is to cover this gap and explore how knowledge is transferred and flows among all the healthcare ecosystems’ players in order to support open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual in nature and adopts a narrative literature review approach. In particular, insights gathered from open innovation literature at the inter-organizational network level, with a particular attention to healthcare ecosystems, and from the knowledge transfer processes, are analyzed in order to propose an interpretative framework for the understanding of knowledge transfer in open innovation with a focus on healthcare ecosystem. Findings: The paper proposes an original interpretative framework for knowledge transfer to support open innovation in healthcare ecosystems, composed of four main components: healthcare ecosystem’s players’ categories; knowledge flows among different categories of players along the exploration and exploitation stages of innovation development; players’ motivations for open innovation; and players’ positions in the innovation process. In addition, assuming the intermediary network as the suitable organizational model for healthcare ecosystem, four classification scenarios are identified on the basis of the main players’ influence degree and motivations for open innovation. Practical implications: The paper offers interpretative lenses for managers and policy makers in understanding the most suitable organizational models able to encourage open innovation in healthcare ecosystems, taking into consideration the players’ motivation and the knowledge transfer processes on the basis of the innovation results. Originality/value: The paper introduces a novel framework that fills a gap in the innovation management literature, by pointing out the key role of external not R&D players, like patients, involved in knowledge transfer for open innovation processes in healthcare ecosystems. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of higher education on the emergence of entrepreneurial intention (EI) and human capital (HC) as a component of intellectual capital (IC) that strongly influences the entrepreneurial process. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a literature review, a theoretical model that is focused on the theory of planned behaviour was defined to verify the impact of higher education on the development of EI and HC. To this end, the structural equation modelling methodology was applied to two samples of students and academics, which differ each other in terms of both education level and specific characteristics of entrepreneurship education activities. Findings: The main results show that there are significant differences between the two considered samples. In particular, the level and specific characteristics of entrepreneurial education are the key factors for the development of EI and HC. Practical implications: The research may be of relevance for universities and policy makers. Universities must devote more attention to training and practice-oriented entrepreneurial courses and collateral activities (projects, initiatives, actions), both for students (first mission) and academic aspiring entrepreneurs (third mission) to encourage the emergence of EI and HC formation. For policy makers, this study suggests the need to define policy guidelines and frameworks to support universities’ educational programmes and activities to strengthen the entrepreneurial process, so that they can be consistent with the EU and national entrepreneurship policies. Originality/value: This explorative research intends to contribute to the scientific debate by filling the knowledge gap that is due to the very limited number of studies that analyse whether and how EI can mediate the relationship between higher education and HC as an IC component. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Dramatic increases in the migration of human resources for health (HRH) from developing countries like the Philippines can have consequences on the sustainability of health systems. In this paper, we trace the outflows of HRH from the Philippines, map out its key causes and consequences, and identify relevant policy responses. Methods: This mixed method study employed a decentered, comparative approach that involved three phases: (a) a scoping review on health workers' migration of relevant policy documents and academic literature on health workers' migration from the Philippines; and primary data collection with (b) 37 key stakeholders and (c) household surveys with seven doctors, 329 nurses, 66 midwives, and 18 physical therapists. Results: Filipino health worker migration is best understood within the context of macro-, meso-, and micro-level factors that are situated within the political, economic, and historical/colonial legacy of the country. Underfunding of the health system and un- or underemployment were push factors for migration, as were concerns for security in the Philippines, the ability to practice to full scope or to have opportunities for career advancement. The migration of health workers has both negative and positive consequences for the Philippine health system and its health workers. Stakeholders focused on issues such as on brain drain, gain, and circulation, and on opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer. Concomitantly, migration has resulted in the loss of investment in human capital. The gap in the supply of health workers has affected the quality of care delivered, especially in rural areas. The opening of overseas opportunities has commercialized health education, compromised its quality, and stripped the country of skilled learning facilitators. The social cost of migration has affected émigrés and their families. At the household level, migration has engendered increased consumerism and materialism and fostered dependency on overseas remittances. Addressing these gaps requires time and resources. At the same time, migration is, however, seen by some as an opportunity for professional growth and enhancement, and as a window for drafting more effective national and inter-country policy responses to HRH mobility. Conclusions: Unless socioeconomic conditions are improved and health professionals are provided with better incentives, staying in the Philippines will not be a viable option. The massive expansion in education and training designed specifically for outmigration creates a domestic supply of health workers who cannot be absorbed by a system that is underfunded. This results in a paradox of underservice, especially in rural and remote areas, at the same time as underemployment and outmigration. Policy responses to this paradox have not yet been appropriately aligned to capture the multilayered and complex nature of these intersecting phenomena. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Increasingly, universities have become conscious of their important role as centres of knowledge generation and diffusion. Accordingly, they have put in place policies, methods and resources to increase knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) activities. However, succeeding in this endeavour is not that easy. An active involvement of researchers is fundamental. Literature examining researchers’ attitude towards KTT activities is limited, offering a partial view on the subject. This study aims at bringing new light to this issue. First, we identify those factors that influence researchers’ willingness to engage in KTT activities. From a comprehensive literature review, we distinguish between intrinsic motivations, extrinsic motivations and university support and services as critical elements. A scale is developed and validated. Second, the scale is applied to the case of R&D contracts. The sample consists of 249 researchers from one of the biggest Spanish universities. Results suggest that the proposed scale has a good fit, indicating that it can be considered as a good instrument for measuring researchers’ willingness to get involved in KTT activities. Policy implications and directions for future research are provided. © 2017 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study applies a systematic literature review and qualitative content analysis to identify and synthesize key factors that enable collaborative innovation between industry and universities. Using a keyword search in the Web of Science database, the review identified 40 papers that were frequently cited on the topic. Results were summarized into seven main themes or central factors stimulating collaborative innovation: resources, university organization, boundary-spanning functions, collaborative experience, culture, status centrality and environmental context. This article elaborates on these ‘enabling factors’ and uses them to summarize a number of results from the reviewed studies regarding facilitators of collaborative innovation. The discussion focuses on how these factors relate and the extent to which they are amenable to policy intervention. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide insights of a systematic literature review (SLR) of the entrepreneurship education and training as facilitators of regional development. Current and future trends in the field are identified. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers an SLR on the entrepreneurship education and training and advances through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis comprising the period 1973-2016. To collect data, only articles published in scientific journals were used in the SCOPUS database. Findings: The results highlight that both training and entrepreneurship education can be a strong strategic tool for regional development, and that it is important for entities such as academia, government and business to cooperate towards the same goal in order to strengthen the entrepreneurial intention of society. Findings reveal three clusters as trends of literature: entrepreneurial universities, entrepreneurial spirit and process of business creation. Originality/value: This paper contributes to fill the gap in terms of SLR on the importance of entrepreneurship education and training for regional development conducted by a bibliometric analysis. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This systematic review establishes what is currently known and, more importantly, what is not known about knowledge transfer (KT) between UK universities and industries. The review focuses on four central measures related to university-industry (U-I) collaboration for KT that have been previously identified in the literature: motivations; activities; barriers; and outcomes. Different rationales underpin existing studies and we frame these using two perspectives: the sociopolitical perspective and the contextual perspective. To date studies with a sociopolitical perspective have largely focused upon 'motivations' to engage in U-I collaboration but largely from academics' perspectives and tangible activities and outcomes have been the foci of the contextual perspective on KT but these have rarely been sector specific. We discuss these and other major findings in terms of policy implications for future research funding. © The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the impact of entrepreneurial orientation on the activities of state universities in the Republic of Serbia. Using the ENTRE-U scale, the researchers have graded the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of the employees at state universities in the Republic of Serbia. In the theoretical part, the detailed literature review is provided, which contributes to a better understanding of terms like entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial university. Using data from 282 respondents who work at the state universities in the Republic of Serbia, the researchers validate the ENTRE-U questionnaire in a specific context. With this, it is proven that the ENTRE-U scale is applicable not only for developed countries but also for the developing countries, such as the Republic of Serbia. The general conclusion is that with using the ENTRE-U scale, it is possible to predict the level of innovativeness, as well as the nature of innovative activities that are conducted at state universities in the Republic of Serbia. The entrepreneurially oriented universities differ from those which lack entrepreneurial orientation by the extent of their research mobilization, unconventional approaches, the level of cooperation with industries, and the way university policies are implemented. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Establishing collaboration strategies with interdisciplinary networks in research is a crucial success factor for the companies in any sector, especially in manufacturing for aeronautics. In the aeronautical supply chain, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) lack of these types of alliances with universities and other research institutions, which could give them access to shared and specialized knowledge, may strictly limit those companies to learning from their own experience. One way to break this dynamic for industrial companies is to be an active part of research, development, and innovation centres. In this paper, a study to create new advanced manufacturing centres is presented, centres whose activities are focused on Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 5-7. The approach is based on a project management methodology, and it is applied to the aeronautical sector in the Basque Country. An initial study of the international experience and state of the art in this type of facility, as well as an analysis of the current socioeconomic environment of the Basque Country are presented. A benchmark study was done to identify the key processes that this centre must promote for this initiative to succeed, or those areas of knowledge that can make or break the initiative. Finally, the results showed a definitive picture for establishing an advanced manufacturing centre in the Basque Country. This work lays both the foundations of knowledge in the sector and the difficulties noted, so it can serve as guidance for similar initiatives. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the variables that play a relevant role in the management of university-industry linkage and technology transfer in the context of a public university in Mexico. Design/methodology/approach: This study is quantitative, and the method is based on an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), to identify the group of variables that relates to university-industry technology transfer, by applying a questionnaire to full time professors and researchers. Findings: The EFA allowed for the analysis of the relationships within a group of variables, and found that the structure of the principal components presents a close connection to the literature review. The first, second and third factors, named institutional support in the linkage and technology transfer activities, research results management, and university linkage activities planning, respectively, explain the original problem in a greater percentage. Additionally, it is suggested to include other variables, to increase the explained variance percentage of the components. Social implications: The study of university-industry linkage and technology transfer allows for improvement in the institutional management of these activities, their entrepreneurship, and consequently, their use by companies, government and society. Originality/value: This study focuses on analyzing a group of variables in a questionnaire, in order to identify those that are related to the university-industry technology transfer management, in the context of a public university in Mexico. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Conflict in environmental governance is common, and bringing together stakeholders with diverse perspectives in situations of conflict is extremely difficult. However, case studies of how diverse stakeholders form self-organized coalitions under these circumstances exist and provide invaluable opportunities to understand the causal mechanisms that operate in the process. We focus on the case of the Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve nomination process, which unfolded over several years and moved the region from a series of serious conflicts to one where stakeholders came together to support a Biosphere Reserve nomination. Causal mechanisms identified from the literature and considered most relevant to the case were confirmed in it, using an 'explaining outcomes' process tracing methodology. Perceived severity of the problem, institutional emulation, and institutional entrepreneurship all played an important role in the coalition-building process. The fear of marginalization was identified as a potential causal mechanism that requires further study. The findings here contribute to filling an important gap in the literature related to causal mechanisms for self-organized coalition-building under conflict, and contribute to practice with important considerations when building a coalition for natural resource management and governance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Today's digital technologies, such as social media, business analytics, the Internet of Things, big data, advanced manufacturing, 3D printing, cloud and cyber-solutions and MOOCs, permeate every private and public organization. However, even if this phenomenon has been analyzed for entrepreneurship in general, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of digital technologies on academic entrepreneurship remains not only slightly addressed. With the aim of filling this gap, this paper proposes a novel contribution regarding the emerging concept of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. Based on a qualitative literature review, an interpretative framework for Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is deductively proposed that is composed of the following components: the rationale for the adoption of digital technologies for academic entrepreneurship (why), the emerging forms of digital academic entrepreneurship (what), the stakeholders involved through the digital technologies to achieve the academic entrepreneurship goal (who), and the processes of academic entrepreneurship supported by digital technologies (how). The discussion section provides a conceptualization of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. The paper closes with the identification of a research agenda for this promising and under-researched field. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nearly two-thirds of millennials aspire to start their own business or have already done so. Innovation and entrepreneurship are dominant forces driving innovation in a dynamic global economy, and universities have an essential role in cultivating the innovators and entrepreneurs of the future. In most universities, capstone senior design courses have an entrepreneurship component. We describe a cross-institution workshop designed to heighten student awareness of university resources supporting entrepreneurship. Drexel University and University of Pennsylvania STEM libraries collaborated with the professional society IEEE to organize a workshop highlighting the role of campus information resources in empowering entrepreneurs. The workshop was organized in a panel discussion format, featuring technology transfer professionals, librarians from both institutions, and examples of successful innovators and entrepreneurs. This allowed for active interaction and networking with the panelists. We review the state-of-the-art in entrepreneurship education, report student feedback, and offer lessons learned from this experience. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

AB  - The role of academic research in the economic growth process has been widely considered over the last two decades in the theoretical and empirical literature, particularly around the concept of knowledge-based economy. Meanwhile, the very recent notion of “blue growth” and the significant development potential related to marine environments have gained more and more concern for policy makers on different scales. It is therefore interesting to assess the academic research related to marine issues, owing to its potential contribution to this dynamics growth through knowledge transfers and academic spillovers. This paper provides a global evaluation of the marine academic production, using a spatialized, open and transdisciplinary approach. In particular, this approach is to mobilize indicators to assess scientific production, transpose it to the territorial scale and make a global comparison of “research territories” in the case of marine science, with a specific focus on European cities. The results show that the five main centres are Tokyo (Japan), Paris (France), San Diego (USA), Moscow (Russia) and Woods Hole (USA). A dense European territorial coverage in marine science centres also appears, and new world major centres such as Chinese and Brazilian ones emerge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the main factors that influence the efficient use of cogeneration systems is the heat demand variation. The second influencing factor is generated by the restrictions imposed by the related legislation. Besides this two, the poor stage of the consumer’s insulation and of the heat distribution network, or the lack of the main know-how energy management concepts seriously affects the good functioning of a producer-consumer energy mix. The university together with the university Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHP) represent a supplier and consumer system. In this paper, are presented a few major energy management decisions that has been taken and applied to the university CHP and campus. This package of energy management solutions has been taken to increase the performances of university CHP and to bring them in accordance with the state of the art. At the present, in order to optimize the operating regimes of the cogeneration plant, authors have studied the correlation between functioning load of the plant and the possible solutions that could be applied to increase the plant performances. Those solutions have to be strongly correlated with the consumers’ heat demand. In this regard one proposed measure is to sell the heat into the district heating network of the city. Another proposed solution for which there has been performed a technical-economic analysis, is the implementation of a new equipment that can generate centralized cold in order to supply a part of the University Campus buildings. The new cooling system will use as primer energy source the heat recovered from the CHP plant. In this special case study, two main important problems occurs, both being related to the type of the consumer: public institution where the demand for cooling suffers huge variations and where occupants have little incentive to follow the rules of good energy management. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

AB  - In this study, we develop a firm-dominated incremental cooperation model. Following the critical review of current literature and various cooperation models, we identified a number of strengths and shortcomings that form the basis for our framework. The objective of our theoretical model is to contribute to overcome the existing gap within academic literature and theory pertaining to University-Industry (U-I) cooperation (in the context of small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)) while improving practice in real world context. The uniqueness of the new cooperation model provides a number of benefits over the previous ones in relation to better communication channels and an incremental process that aids in the elimination of risk and cost. Therefore, the probabilities of success for this model, especially in the context of SMEs, should be underlined. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The Internet has changed the skills required from managers, but not fundamentally, so any existing good manager can also become a proficient e-manager. The open nature of the Internet drives its success, and e-businesses allow their partners, suppliers or consumers an extraordinary degree of access to databases and their inner work. In its turn, this revolution in communications has shifted the focus on selecting adequate workforce skills and knowledge. This is where academic education finds its niche, by using e-activities widely for all e-learners ready to step up own careers and capitalise on entrepreneur ideas, and wishing to become proficient e-managers. Getting intelligent proactive graduates to share know-how takes more than money or state of the art software, although both can help; it requires people with lifelong study skills, best cultivated in academic environments, able to move in step with fast-emerging contemporary challenges. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Institute of Innovation and Industrial Management operates a learning factory (LeanLab) since 2014 to enhance academic education, company trainings and hands-on research in the fields of industrial engineering and logistics. The aim is to enable practice oriented learning in an environment close to industrial reality for facilitating effective knowledge-transfer. An extension with state of the art technologies relevant for future manufacturing sites is currently planned. Learning factories are suitable platforms for applying, testing and spreading technologies and should thus guarantee better and more targeted technology-development and transfer. Moreover, training sessions for workers will be designed to prepare them for the Industry 4.0 environment in the factory of the future. These trainings will focus on the development of the skills and qualifications necessary for workers to cope with the increasing complexity in industrial environments. This paper presents the actual state of the LeanLab and illustrates the next concrete steps towards an Industry 4.0 learning factory. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - University-industry (U-I) collaboration has gained increased attention in recent years. Several best practices and models have been proposed to address the problem of establishing U-I collaborations and improving their effectiveness. It is important for the stakeholders to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of their collaborative efforts in order to identify and adopt improvements. One way to assess effectiveness is through the maturity models approach that has been applied successfully in other areas such as quality assurance, knowledge management, and business processes. Our literature review indicates a lack of existing collaboration maturity models. In this paper, we present the University-industry Collaboration Maturity Model (UICMM) - a collaboration maturity model based on the thorough review of best practices for collaboration described in existing literature, and existing maturity models relevant to collaborations. UICMM is intended to be a useful benchmarking tool for a range of stakeholders including universities and industry to assess and benchmark their collaborative efforts. The underlying hypothesis while developing this maturity model is that a higher level of maturity will lead to increased collaboration and improved outcomes. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The substantial acknowledgement of university–industry (U–I) collaborations as promotor of economic progress, innovativeness and competitiveness fostered a continuous research engagement. At the same time, the U–I literature experienced a notable increase in the past decade, transforming into a multi-faceted and ambiguous research field, characterised by highly complex interlinks. The recent transformation hinders a comprehensive understanding of the latest developments in research directions and their clear delineation. Therefore, the purpose of this bibliometric literature review is to examine the evolution of the field and identify the primary emerging patterns. This paper employs co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling techniques to analyse the U–I publications dataset. The findings indicate that the U–I collaborations research can be systematically clustered, resulting in an interconnected ecosystem consisting of three levels: individual, organisational and institutional, respectively. Thus, this review presents the immense contribution that the analysis of U–I collaborations makes to various research streams. Building on these findings and employing qualitative content analysis on the clustered publications, the paper develops a research agenda that encourages future investigations of previously overlooked features of U–I collaborations in general, and their role across levels of analysis, contexts and stages of the collaboration process in particular. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The world is shaped by an education system that reinforces unsustainable thinking and practice. Efforts to transform our societies must thus prioritise the education of educators – building their understanding of sustainability and their ability to transform curriculum and wider learning opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to focus on university educators and critically review the professional development and policy landscape challenges that influence their effective engagement with Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The paper is informed by a pan-European collaboration involving 33 countries that identified emerging scholarship and practice in this area and assessed the lessons learned from ESD professional development initiatives. It sets the context for a special issue titled “Professional Development in Higher Education for Sustainable Development” that draws together a collection of articles focusing on professional development of university educators across the world. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a critical review of existing practice, international policy frameworks and literature relating to ESD, professional development and higher education. It examines innovative initiatives worldwide that seek to improve the capability of educators in higher education to integrate ESD into academic practice at individual, disciplinary and institutional levels. A rigorous process of selection was applied and overseen by an international expert group. This ensured that the initiatives sought educational change in ESD, and not simply the embedding of content about sustainability into learning opportunities. It also assured that the initiatives had a clear and intentional professional learning process to underpin the engagement of participants with ESD. Findings: ESD has grown in visibility and status worldwide, with a clear increase in activity in higher education. The sector is viewed as a significant force for change in societies, through the education provision it offers to future professionals and leaders in all sectors. However, universities currently lack capacity to integrate ESD effectively into mainstream teaching practices and the training they provide for academic staff or to integrate ESD into their institutional teaching and learning priorities. Many ESD activities remain focused on teaching issues arising in sustainable development research and delivering specialist modules or courses in sustainability. Very few countries and institutions have significant staff development programmes to enhance the ESD competences of university educators and build their academic leadership capabilities for ESD. The contributions to this special issue show the need for greater understanding of the multi-level task of integrating ESD into professional development activities, not just for individual impact in the classroom but to advance institutional change and decisively influence the teaching and learning discourse of higher education. Originality/value: There are few research studies and documented activities on ESD professional development in higher education available in the literature. This paper attempts to explore what ESD professional development involves and describes its complexity within the higher education sector. The special issue provides a collection of innovative research and practical initiatives that can help those involved in education and learning to develop ESD as a priority for future university innovative pathways. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper analyzes the influence of relational capital in business internationalization, focusing on university spin-offs. Design/methodology: A literature review based on the theories of relational capital and networking from an international perspective. A theoretic model is then developed. Findings: The analyses in this paper show that relational capital influences the internationalization of university spin-offs in a positive manner. In addition, the firm's performance in its international activities depends on its capabilities to create and maintain relationships with the relational capital agents. Research limitations/implications: This is a theoretical paper; because of this, it would be advisable to complete it using a hybrid methodology, i.e., qualitative and quantitative analyses. Moreover, it would be useful to consider other sectors besides the technology sector. Practical implications: Following the literature review, which is limited to studies that jointly address these issues, a strategic analysis tool is developed that aims to improve the management of the relational capital to create value. This is carried out as part of the decision-making process related to the effect and links among the elements of the aforementioned capital, taking into account an international perspective. Social implications: In the current globalized economy, intangible management is more important than it used to be, in order to obtain competitive advantages in the business world. Furthermore, internationalization becomes an escape route in the face of a difficult economic situation, in which small companies must overcome significant problems in the local market. Originality/value: Nowadays, business internationalization is very important, and in this context, relational capital management plays a critical role in achieving competitive advantages. In spite of this, the literature review is restricted to studies that jointly address both issues (relational capital and internationalization). This makes for an interesting challenge, which is what this paper attempts to examine, through application in one of the most influential sectors in economic development. © 2019 OmniaScience.

AB  - Within recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of the University's role in economic development. This has resulted in University Technology Transfer (UTT) taking place within an increasingly complex network of regional stakeholders. This complexity has resulted in quadruple helix models where the triple helix model of academia, industry and regional government now includes societal based innovation users as a fourth helix. Despite this development, extant research is fragmented and lacks coherent frameworks and conceptualisations which fully depict the dynamic and evolving nature of UTT. Accordingly, this article reviews Mode 2 UTT from a quadruple helix perspective to identify key themes to develop a research agenda which reflects progression from a triple into a quadruple helix ecosystem. © 2016 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The paper describes the process of designing and launching a new model of entrepreneurship education in engineering by a British university. The main driver behind this initiative has been engineering department's strategy to deliver education aligned to the global state-of-the-art practices, focused on user-centered design, technology-driven entrepreneurship, problem-based learning and a focus on rigor in the engineering fundamentals. This complemented the university's initiative to embed entrepreneurship across all its programmes. Traditionally the entrepreneurship education originated in business or management schools. In the last decades many educational institutions have introduced entrepreneurial education in the engineering curriculum. There are three main models used by the first academic institutions in the United States for entrepreneurial education. A decade later, another study undertaken on more than two hundred universities in five countries suggested five models of entrepreneurship education for engineering students. The paper is focused on the new and more complex model that has been developed, consisting in an entrepreneurship initiative pursued independently by engineering and the business school, supported by the university's innovation and business support team, and by external partnerships with entrepreneurship centres based in schools of engineering. Moreover all university's students are exposed additional extra-curricular entrepreneurship training. The Engineering & Entrepreneurship undergraduate programme was launched in September 2018. The paper discusses the process of designing the engineering & entrepreneurship programme's innovative structure, content, and assessment, within the frame of the evolution of similar programmes. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

AB  - Universities facilitate academic entrepreneurship or their ‗third mission‘ by making available supporting mechanisms such as science and technology parks, incubators, and entrepreneurship programs. Botswana‘s STEM University seeks to develop a technology park in which it will commercialize the research and intellectual property developed by its faculty members, students, research centers and the country‘s private sector through incubation and other processes. As a business support process, technology business incubation nurtures start-up companies and mitigates the risk of their early failure. In this enabling environment, start-ups can concentrate on technology transfer and later ―hatch‖ or leave the incubator financially viable and self-sustaining. Pursuing academic entrepreneurship and the university-model of technology business incubation present benefits for the country, the local community and the university in terms of economic development, economic diversification, job creation, technology development, viable firms, successful products, and the enhancement of university income and prestige. However, university and faculty culture, and the extent of faculty members‘ knowledge and skills in entrepreneurship and social capital may temper this potential. Utilizing a narrative review of the literature, this paper sought to identify critical issues a newly-participating university should be aware of as it seeks to adopt the university-model of business incubation to facilitate its transformation from a primary focus on its traditional research and teaching missions to one also based on the formal commercialization activities characterizing academic entrepreneurship. The paper informs on approaches the university may adopt to encourage academic entrepreneurship among its faculty members. © 2020, Sciedu Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Higher education institutions are called to expand their role and responsibilities, by enhancing their entrepreneurial mindset and redefining relationships with stakeholders. In order to cope with these new challenges, they have started to operate in a strategic manner, by performing marketing and merchandising activities. Indeed, in a sector characterized by the presence of competitive funding models, several forms of accountability, and performance indicators, universities have become open systems and have started to operate like enterprises, considering students as customers. Given this premise, the aim of the paper is to individuate marketing and merchandising strategies in higher education and to evaluate their effectiveness in order to foster stakeholders engagement. This is in line with the entrepreneurial university model that represents the starting point of the theoretical study, then a literature review of “marketization” in higher education institutions is presented, showing how this field is not yet completely investigated. Data refer to the Italian context and are analyzed through a qualitative method. Findings suggest that most Italian universities perform merchandising strategies, but currently there is not sufficient information to evaluate their effectiveness in higher education, it was only possible to make hypotheses. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objectif: Identifier la production scientifique des CHU dans la base de données internationale Web of Science et produire les indicateurs bibliométriques comparatifs permettant de la positionner parmi les acteurs de la recherche biomédicale en France. Méthodes: Afin de disposer de données fiables, la première étape a consisté à unifier toutes les variantes d'adresse des 32 CHU/CHR dans le Web of Science sous la forme d’ « Organization-Enhanced ». Les indicateurs bibliométriques (nombre de publications, indice de citation normalisé Top 1 %, Top 10 %, part d'articles en collaboration) ont été calculés pour analyser la production des CHU et des organismes membres d'Aviesan (Alliance nationale pour les sciences de la vie et de la santé). Résultats: En termes de volumes de production, les CHU sont le 3e producteur national de publications, après les universités et le CNRS; ils contribuent à environ 17 % de la production française et à 2,5 % de la production européenne (UE28). Au cours des 10 ans, l'impact de ces publications augmente plus vite que le volume. La visibilité et l'impact des publications des CHU reflètent leurs activités de recherche, d'enseignement et de transfert. Conclusion: Cette étude a permis d'objectiver la production scientifique des CHU et de démontrer la place majeure qu'ils occupent dans la recherche biomédicale française, jouant un rôle incontournable dans le transfert d'innovations à la pratique clinique. Objectives: The aim of the current study is to identify the output of French university hospitals in the Web of Science database and to perform a comparative bibliometric analysis to characterize their position in the national biomedical research landscape. Methods: The first stage consisted in creating the unified “Organization-Enhanced” records in the Web of Science for 32 university hospitals, in order to ensure the reliable aggregated data. The research output of university hospitals and organizations members of the French National Alliance for Life Sciences and Health (Aviesan) are analyzed using bibliometric indicators, including the number of publications, category normalized citation impact, top one percent and top 10 percent of the most cited papers, international collaboration rate. Results: In terms of publication output, university hospitals rank 3rd in France, after universities and CNRS. They contribute to about 17 % of the total national production and to 2.5 % of the European publications (EU28). Over the 10 years period, the impact of the papers produced by university hospitals grows faster than volume. Visibility and impact comply with the university hospitals’ core assignments: teaching, research and knowledge transfer. Conclusion: This study provides objective data showing a leading position of the university hospitals among the biomedical research organizations in France, playing a major role in patient-based research. © 2018

AB  - The software industry is strongly influenced by knowledge and innovation. The ability to develop new solutions and services is considered essential to firm survival and growth. The innovation process, being long and costly, relies heavily on interorganizational relations and the interaction between different types of actors (e.g., intermediary support organizations, universities, R&D centers) that can advance knowledge transfer and innovation. Consequently, innovation is seen as an open and interactive process. Many researches related to economic geography have demonstrated that the different types of proximity can be an important tool to facilitate interactions and knowledge exchange. The Information and communication technology (ICT) sector is recognized as a key driving force for Lebanon’s economy. It is a fast growing sector with an estimated market size of USD 436.2 million in 2016. Furthermore, Lebanon is emerging as a leading exporter of software development and services in the region. The methodology of this paper is mainly based on a literature review and interviews based on semi-structured interviews, which were conducted face to face, or by phone. The first objective of this paper is to analyze the characteristics and dynamics of innovation within the Lebanese software industry. The second objective is to provide a framework to analyze how the different types of proximity affect the innovation and the interactions inter-actors within this industry. The paper demonstrates that innovation in the Lebanese software sector is often driven by the demand and the client’s needs and request. In addition, we noticed that in Lebanon, the local R&D structures or the universities do not support this sector. Furthermore, the support offered by the Lebanese government is still weak and this is manly related to the complexity of the political and social system in Lebanon. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - A significant body of work already highlights the relevance of curriculum, internships, trainings, Soft skills, collaborative research and informal relationships, to university-institution linkages. This study identifies relevant sources and applications of university-institution linkages which leads to entrepreneurial skills. The impacts of sources are systematically reviewed to examine their relevance to entrepreneurial formation. We present a conceptual model developed through systematic review of exploratory researches by academic and industry researchers. We considered research work conducted after the year 2000 which contributed to the development of university-entrepreneurial frameworks in WOS and SCOPUS. Each identified source and application is validated by two significant reviews. This study concludes by identifying future research needs and gaps for imparting entrepreneurial skills, in all educational institutions. The theme of 'Structured Entrepreneurial Course' is to be amalgamated into the course structure, depending on the course outcome of academic programmes. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - An overview of current trends and laws that addresses the ethical problems in Big Data and AI is researched in this paper while recommending an ethical knowledge management strategy and direction for these activities. AI, data analytics and Big Data are technologies that are affecting the management of knowledge world-wide and a code of laws and practices that extends worldwide is needed. A literature review investigates the connections between the use of Big Data, AI and Analytics and the ethical considerations. The use of a stated data protection code of conduct backed up by legal constraints is developing but in its infancy. Academic researchers and business practioners of knowledge management should be interested in developing an ethical approach to this new set of technologies that puts access to knowledge on the desk of every knowledge worker while protecting the individual from unethical and illegal misuse of their data. This paper presents a set of principles for governing this new frontier of ethics and legality from the literature. Knowledge management needs a seat at the table for this new technology of knowledge acquisition and used to further develop knowledge management strategies for ethical AI and Big data use. © Copyright The Authors, 2018.

AB  - The focus of this paper is to review the qualitative case methods that have been used in technology transfer research over the last 20 years from 1996 to 2015. Case methods allow for more in-depth analyses and provide the opportunity to place research into a certain context due to the selection of e.g. specific sectors, institutions, countries, etc. Using a systematic literature review of five of the top journals in the field of technology transfer research, namely Journal of Technology Transfer, Research Policy, Science and Public Policy, R&D Management and Technovation, it yielded 107 articles using the search terms: “Technology Transfer” AND (“Case Study” OR “Case Method” OR “Qualitative”). Our findings indicate a clustering of themes using qualitative case methods around technology transfer mechanisms and TTOs, academic entrepreneurship, university-industry collaboration, commercialization as well as R&D and firm knowledge transfer. We also identify trends in case method technology transfer research with respect to authorship, location of papers, sectoral contexts, data collection, numbers of cases and data analysis software. We conclude our paper discussing the implications of trends and themes and suggest that researchers need to reflect on used terminology and their utilization and postulate a need for more plurality of data collection methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, university patenting has grown dramatically as a result of the US Bayh-Dole Act (1980) and efforts among universities to encourage faculty to pursue intellectual property. Recent reviews of the literature show that university technology transfer is primarily conceptualized in terms a relatively linear process of disclosure, patenting, and licensing. While this is the general pattern for university patenting, many faculty inventions are also patented outside the university. Using data from a national survey of academic patenters, this paper estimates probit and negative binomial regression models to assess individual and organizational factors that contribute to patenting external to the traditional technology transfer process among university scientists. Findings indicate that external patenting is a function of the science, scientist's training, and the lack of a department culture of encouraging patenting via technology transfer offices. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Over the past decades, public policy has promoted the establishment of science parks to support the development and growth of technology-based firms and, as such, spur economic prosperity. However, despite the worldwide proliferation of science parks and scholarly interest, their contribution is yet to be fully understood. This paper presents the current state of knowledge on science park contribution using the Input–Mediator–Outcome framework and is based upon an analysis of 175 journal articles published between 1988 and 2018. Furthermore, the paper uncovers critical methodological and theoretical deficiencies in the literature, and identifies promising avenues for future research, which will provide important insights to both academics and practitioners. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Although Landscape Character Assessment (LCA) has gained a significant recognition around the globe, the understanding of the challenges faced by planners and decision- makers in incorporating LCA processes and outputs in land-use planning remains insufficient. This paper presents a snapshot of the barriers to effective LCA-based land-use planning in Israel, with regard to four distinct phases of the process: (a) the knowledge development phase, i.e., the formulation of a credible LCA approach; (b) the approach adoption phase, i.e., the willingness to incorporate LCA processes and outputs into land-use planning; (c) the knowledge transfer phase, i.e., the actual incorporation of LCA outputs into land-use planning; and (d) the application management phase, i.e., the transition of LCA- based plans into action. To investigate the barriers, the study combines a literature review with thematic analysis of eight Israeli LCA-based land-use plans from all planning levels, and individual in-depth interviews with 35 senior planners and decision makers involved in the design and implementation of these plans. The study reveals that within the general trajectory of mainstreaming LCA approach in Israel over the past two and a half decades, significant gaps exist between LCA knowledge, LCA-based land-use planning, and on- ground action and results. The extent of the gaps differs across plans and planning scales. The gaps are rooted in the complexity of the LCA approach; language barriers; scientific and technical limitations; inconsistency and subjectivity; different academic, planning, and decision-making traditions; limited institutional capacity; vagueness and over-flexibility of approved LCA-based planning principles and instructions; and lack of sufficient involvement by stakeholders. This paper offers suggestions as to how these gaps might be bridged in the Israeli context. In conclusion, the study recommends the following: developing a legally binding, generic, credible, and continuously updated LCA-based planning guide, that should be written in the native language; establishing a national and comprehensive free-access online information center for sharing LCA knowledge; strengthening of institutional capacities at all planning levels; enhancing planners' and consultants' LCA skills; and inclusion of all affected stakeholders in the process. Broadening the understanding of the obstacles and solutions to effective application of LCA processes and outputs in land-use planning and management practices can contribute to operationalizing this approach in various contexts and eventually, advance the reduction of anthropogenic pressures on valuable landscapes. © 2016

AB  - Introduction: Technology transfer aims at supporting the transfer of results from software engineering research from academia to industrial application. Objective: This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis. Results: Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer. Conclusion: Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Latin American countries have adopted different models of units or transfer offices associated with improved competitiveness; however, it is unclear whether they have been successful or if they have been designed while taking into account the context and particularities of the region. This article aims to summarize the concept of transfer offices and the context of the generation of knowledge through patents in Latin America, and identify strategies that have been suggested in the literature to set up and operate this type of offices, based on the Latin American context. Design/methodology: Through a systemic literature review, academic articles indexed in the ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases were analyzed to identify the literature related to the context of technology transfer and transfer offices. We cited and analyzed in depth a total of 40 articles. For a review of the Latin American context, 29 documents were reviewed and referenced. Previous documents were taken from specialized networks of the Scientific Information System REDALYC and libraries of universities, such as the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, among others. Additionally, we added reports and publications by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), and REDEMPRENDIA. Statistical data provided by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) were used for the analysis of patent generation cases in Latin American countries. Subsequently, the literature of the systematic review was compared with studies by authors and Latin American entities, which give a regional context to this work. Finally, strategies were discussed and identified for the consolidation of transfer offices that impact the generation of knowledge in the region. Findings: The results of the literature review conducted revealed that several authors have proposed extensive mechanisms for transfer offices in Latin America that reject the general practices based on patent generation, due to the low generation of patents in the region. These mechanisms permit the generation and transfer of knowledge through different means. Therefore, the results of this article allow for a definition of strategies that has been adjusted to the reality and needs of Latin America, in order to consolidate the transfer offices. Originality/value: The contribution made by this article is focused on identifying possible strategies for consolidating transfer offices that contribute to the technological development of Latin American countries, taking into account the cultural context and limitations of the institutions of higher education. © 2018, OmniaScience.

AB  - This study describes the development of a university technology transfer supply chain network sustainability tool that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) can use to become more self-reliant financially. HBCUs lag behind their peer non-HBCUs because historically they have been under-served and were originally established largely as teaching and blue collar trade schools. Increased involvement in research oriented activities such as technology transfer will likely enable HBCUs to grow into new or stronger research institutions. The literature review revealed several problem areas with non-HBCUs university technology transfer include a resource planning issues. These problem areas for non-HBCUs would be challenging for HBCUs as well. Problems with university technology transfer have led to unethical behavior among faculty inventors and university technology transfer specialists at non-HBCUs (C. Hamilton, Schumann, D., 2016). Despite these problems, the non-HBCUs are generating licensing revenues. Systems dynamics is the process of combining the theory, method and philosophy necessary to analyze the behavior of a system in order to provide a common foundation that can be applied whenever it is desired to understand and influence how things change over time. Applying the systems dynamics approach, a budget resource planning tool was developed using a linear programming optimization technique. This study illustrates that classic industrial uses of linear programming optimization techniques can uniquely be used to optimize budget resource planning for sustainable HBCU supply chain networks and other emerging research institutions. © 2017 American Society for Engineering Management.

AB  - Background: Preference experiments are used to understand how patients and stakeholders value aspects of health care. These methods are gaining popularity in dentistry, but quality and breadth of use have not been evaluated. Objectives: To describe multiattribute stated preference experiment use in dentistry through illustration and critique of existing studies. Data Sources: Systematic literature search of PubMed, Econlit and Ovid for Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, and All EBM Reviews, as well as gray literature. Study Eligibility: Multiattribute stated preference experiments eliciting preferences for dental service delivery, treatments, and oral health states from the perspective of patients, the public, and dental professionals. Outcomes of interest were preference weights and marginal rates of substitution. Study selection was independently performed by 2 reviewers. Appraisal: Ten-point checklist published by the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research was used for quality assessment. Synthesis: Descriptive analysis. Results: Searches identified 12 records published between 1999 and 2015, mostly in nondental academic journals. Studies were undertaken in high-income countries in Europe and the United States. The studies aimed to elicit preference for service delivery, treatment, or oral health states from the perspective of the patients, dentists, or the public via discrete choice experiment methods. The quality scores for the studies ranged from 53% to 100%. Limitations: A detailed description and critique of stated preference methods are provided, but it was not possible to provide synthesized preference data. Conclusions: Multiattribute stated preference experiments are increasingly popular, but understanding the methods and outputs is essential for designing and interpreting preference studies to improve patient care. Patient preferences highlight important considerations for decision making during treatment planning. Valuation of health states and estimation of willingness-to-pay are important for resource planning and allocation and economic evaluation. Preference estimates and relative value of attributes for interventions and service delivery inform development and selection of treatments and services (PROSPERO 21.3.17: CRD42017059859). Knowledge Transfer Statement: Understanding patient, professional, and public preferences is fundamental for evidence-based decision making and treatment delivery. Preference elicitation methods can be used to estimate the value given to health states, service delivery, individual treatments, and health outcomes. By describing and appraising the methodology and application of multiattribute stated preference experiments in dentistry, this review provides an essential first step to wider use of well-designed, high-quality preference elicitation methods. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2018.

AB  - “Open Teaching & Learning” in a University/academic environment becomes increasingly more important and needs to be designed in the most efficient and effective way to ensure a balanced return-on-investment. This issue is of particular importance when it comes to complex learning areas. In this context, the paper addresses opportunities applying new learning technologies within a multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural environment to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art learning methodologies (knowledge transfer process) to ensure a higher learning engagement of all employees, taking into consideration function, age, culture and technological abilities. The results arising from this paper will identify the pedagogic and business impact of an individualized application of a knowledge transfer strategy. After a review of literature on the subject, the paper concludes with a proposal of the optimal knowledge transfer strategy. This strategy is to be integrated into the existing pedagogic provisions of a multi-disciplinary / multi-cultural R&D (learning) environment of a global PTS company. The strategy can also be used in an academic environment to aid problem solving and engineering knowledge transfer. © 2017, Lift and Escalator Symposium Educational Trust. All rights reserved.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is thus considered as one important determinant to generate knowledge-based economic growth. Since today’s entrepreneurship deals with heterogeneous groups, the norms and values that govern interactions and relationships among people and institutions must be given due emphasis. In recent years there is growing empirical evidence that social capital contributes significantly to development and sustainability. However, literature on the role of social capital in enhancing the performance of the entrepreneurial university in Malaysia is scarce and perhaps almost absent. The main objective of this study is to identify the impacts of social capital towards the performance of an entrepreneurial university. Specifically, this study focuses on exploring the potentials of social capital in enhancing the performance of the entrepreneurial university in Malaysia through four main elements namely: trust, networking, shared values and shared vision. A literature review was conducted to identify and develop appropriate research instruments to be utilized in this study. Quantitative method approach was used in this research. Selected respondents was taken among the six public university which is University Technology Mara (UiTM),UniversityTeknikal Malaysia Melaka(UTeM), University Utara Malaysia(UUM), University Putra Malaysia(UPM), UniversitiTeknologi Malaysia(UTM) and University Malaysia Perlis(UNIMAP) as they are among the five finalists of MOHE Entrepreneurial Awards (MEA) in 2012. Subsequently, this study employed a descriptive and inferential analysis to test the conceptual framework in order to understand the impacts of social capital on the performance of an entrepreneurial university. This study providesrecommendations for university management to review specific policies initiatives and strategies related to social capital towards enhancing the performance of entrepreneurial universities in Malaysia. © 2019 SERSC.

AB  - Since 1980 universities have been able to commercialize inventions that their faculty researchers create as per the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act (P.L. 96-517). Research universities can now own and license these inventions to small and well established companies. Since 1980, research universities have used tech commercialization to support their regional economies with product development and sales, and academic entrepreneurship resulting in university spinoffs and start-up business formations. This results in job creation. The technology transfer offices (TTOs) which were established at many research universities to manage this process have been studied quite extensively. However, the foundational elements that fuel successful TTO performance has not been studied comprehensively. Instead, there are numerous fragmented studies that date back to the early 1980s. In addition, there is no agreed upon common theory for studying university technology and how these elemental inputs related to performance outputs. Thus, herein it is advocated that the resource-based view (J. Barney, 1991) and theory on environmental munificence (Castrogiovanni, 1991, 2002) be used as a theoretical framework for researching university technology commercialization. Competitive resources in a more munificent environment can make it easier for an organization to survive and prosper. © Copyright© (2018) by American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM).

AB  - The ability to process optical signals without passing into the electrical domain has always attracted the attention of the research community. Processing photons by photons unfolds new scenarios, in principle allowing for unseen signal processing and computing capabilities. Optical computation can be seen as a large scientific field in which researchers operate, trying to find solutions to their specific needs by different approaches; although the challenges can be substantially different, they are typically addressed using knowledge and technological platforms that are shared across the whole field. This significant know-how can also benefit other scientific communities, providing lateral solutions to their problems, as well as leading to novel applications. The aim of this Roadmap is to provide a broad view of the state-of-the-art in this lively scientific research field and to discuss the advances required to tackle emerging challenges, thanks to contributions authored by experts affiliated to both academic institutions and high-tech industries. The Roadmap is organized so as to put side by side contributions on different aspects of optical processing, aiming to enhance the cross-contamination of ideas between scientists working in three different fields of photonics: optical gates and logical units, high bit-rate signal processing and optical quantum computing. The ultimate intent of this paper is to provide guidance for young scientists as well as providing research-funding institutions and stake holders with a comprehensive overview of perspectives and opportunities offered by this research field. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The increasing importance of academic entrepreneurship as a key mechanism for new innovative advancements and regional economic developments fostered a development of this research domain. The burgeoning literature examining key antecedents and consequences of academic entrepreneurship resulted in complex, multifaceted concept development, which hinder both the possibilities to grasp the crucial interlinkages and a comprehensive assessment of the latest theoretical contributions. Thus, to decrease the current risk of the field’s further fragmentation and to support the comparison with the new emerging patterns, this paper seeks to develop new bibliometric insights and outline a nuanced research agenda for further advancements. To conduct a quantitative literature review, this paper employs bibliographic coupling on a sample of 615 Web of Science peer-reviewed articles on academic entrepreneurship. To conduct a comprehensive interpretation of the bibliometric findings, I perform additional hierarchical clustering of the frequent terms and content analysis of the publications. The results indicate that the academic entrepreneurship research field is based on four interconnected clusters: (1) the anatomy of an entrepreneurial university and its main components, (2) university spinoffs and technology commercialization, (3) the identities of academic entrepreneurs and their motivations and barriers in entrepreneurial activities, and (4) knowledge transfer and regional economic impacts. These findings are of high importance to academics who seek to enhance entrepreneurial processes and to policymakers interested in stimulating academic entrepreneurship. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents a systematic literature review of the intersection between intellectual property (IP) management and technology transfer offices (TTOs) in the context of universities in order to understand how TTOs manage IP. IP management is an important issue, as it both enables and restricts the utilization of research results and impacts the competitiveness of technology-based businesses. The literature review shows that previous studies of IP management in TTOs tend to adopt a simplistic view of IP management, recommending that all valuable inventions should be patented. Moreover, academic research into TTOs and actual TTO practices both appear to focus on improving efficiency and outputs measured in terms of numbers of patents, licenses and spin-offs. We call this established view the appropriation mode of TTOs and question it based on the logics of publicly funded research and modern IP management. In its place, we suggest the utilization mode of TTOs, in which TTOs manage IP from publicly funded research in order to govern innovation processes and enable utilization of research results in a broader sense. Several recommendations are provided for both researchers and practitioners. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Research on the entrepreneurial university has been receiving increased attention in recent years. The growing literature stock has been leading to a rather unstructured research status quo, characterised by foci on particular elements and actors of the entrepreneurial university. Hence, our paper aims to systematically integrate the fragmented literature on entrepreneurial universities. Relying on the stakeholder theory, our paper provides a stakeholder-based conceptualisation. We identify seven research streams and devised an integrative systematic university-centred view on the entrepreneurial university itself and its core stakeholders within its organisational boundaries and beyond, such as researchers, firms, the economy and society. We illustrate and discuss the findings and conclude with a future research agenda. Due to its systemic nature, our integrative stakeholder-based conceptualisation of the literature on the entrepreneurial university enables the identification of important future research directions that particularly address the linkages between the stakeholder groups and the overall ecosystem.

AB  - Cloud computing and the service-oriented business model are transforming the way software is developed, delivered, and used. Servicization of digital products creates new challenges for software companies to be able to reap the benefits of this change. Pricing is recognized as an essential component of software product management that affects the overall performance of the product and the company. Existing academic research on SaaS pricing is fragmented and separated from a wide range of practitioner literature. As a result, a comprehensive body of knowledge on SaaS pricing is missing. Our paper reports the results of a multi-vocal literature review on 76 identified pieces of "white" academic literature and 149 items that belong to "grey" literature. The goal of our study is to answer the question on whether we know how to price SaaS by summarizing the existing knowledge from different research areas and practice on SaaS pricing, and identify the areas which require further investigation.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored, from the perspective of its staff, the extent to which a Jordanian University has become entrepreneurial and to examine the knowledge management factors which are most important in making this transition. Methodology: Following a systematic review of the current literature, and using a quantitative methodology, supported by a pragmatist theoretical approach, this study used an online anonymous survey to gather the views and perceptions of university academic staff about the entrepreneurial maturity of their own institution specifically, and more generally about the knowledge management factors which can promote entrepreneurialism in academic institutions in developing countries. Findings: The findings indicated that although the case example university was perceived as progressing well towards its aim of becoming an Entrepreneurial University, it was evident that institutions such as this face a number of barriers which is perhaps more prominent in a developing country like Jordan, where higher education is still more commonly viewed through a traditional lens. However, the findings indicated a good level of support for the use of entrepreneurial centres to act as business incubators, and there was an appetite for forging stronger links with businesses and on learning outside of the traditional university context. Furthermore, the findings suggested that the focus towards entrepreneurialism had led to improvements in knowledge transfer and application processes in particular, but that going forward academia and industry alike need to continue to adapt and change, align and strengthen knowledge management, and work collaboratively to achieve the archetype "third mission" with mutual benefits for all. Originality: There are limited studies of university entrepreneurialism within developing countries and the exploration of barriers and enablers that impact upon entrepreneurship within universities more generally. This study therefore makes a makes a valuable contribution towards the strategic debate on entrepreneurial universities. © 2019, Allied Academies.

AB  - The paper conducts a systematic literature review on the development process of universities towards the entrepreneurial model to provide a conceptual framework and a strategic research agenda. From the analysis of the body of literature on the topic, exploration and exploitation emerge as critical processes in the development of entrepreneurial universities. Nevertheless, the way they are balanced within universities is an under-researched topic. Adapted from the concept of organisational ambidexterity, this paper develops the notion of university ambidexterity to analyse the development process of entrepreneurial universities. To achieve this research aim, a conceptual model is developed by integrating the learning processes of exploration and exploitation to the previous theories used to analyse the entrepreneurial university. As already emphasised in other studies focusing on the role of ambidexterity in different research contexts, this paper proposes an idea of balance over time. The universities need to balance exploration and exploitation in their evolutionary path towards the entrepreneurial model, but it may be not necessary to invest in exploration and exploitation processes simultaneously. On the contrary, it may be most important to oscillate between periods of exploration and periods of exploitation to achieve ambidexterity over time. As a result, the tensions between exploration and exploitation processes generate a twisting learning path for entrepreneurial universities. Finally, the paper proposes an integrated conceptual framework which consists of six constructs, namely internal organisational environment, external environment, university exploration, university exploitation, university ambidexterity, entrepreneurial university performance. The proposed research hypotheses on the interrelationships between the mentioned constructs and the mediating role of university ambidexterity constitute potential areas of investigation to direct future empirical research and further develop the body of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurial universities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To share experience from a large, ongoing expert reading teleradiology program in Europe and Asia aiming at supporting referring centers to interpret high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with respect to presence of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)-pattern in patients with suspected Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Method: We analyzed data from 01/2014 to 05/2019, including HRCTs from 239 medical centers in 12 European and Asian countries that were transmitted to our Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) via a secured internet connection. Structured reports were generated in consensus by a radiologist with over 20 years of experience in thoracic imaging and a pulmonologist with specific expertise in interstitial lung disease according to current guidelines on IPF. Reports were sent to referring physicians. We evaluated patient characteristics, technical issues, report turnaround times and frequency of diagnoses. We also conducted a survey to collect feedback from referring physicians. Results: HRCT image data from 703 patients were transmitted (53.5% male). Mean age was 63.7 years (SD:17). In 35.1% of all cases diagnosis was “UIP”/”Typical UIP”. The mean report turnaround time was 1.7 days (SD:2.9). Data transmission errors occurred in 7.1%. Overall satisfaction rate among referring physicians was high (8.4 out of 10; SD:3.2). Conclusions: This Eurasian teleradiology program demonstrates the feasibility of cross-border teleradiology for the provision of state-of-the-art reporting despite heterogeneity of referring medical centers and challenges like data transmission errors and language barriers. We also point out important factors for success like the usage of structured reporting templates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The history of universities is marked by transitions in the direction of education and increasing its responsibility to society. Some revolutions caused by social problems provided the emergence of so-called entrepreneurial universities, where in addition to the educational role, universities now have mission is to improve the economy and social development. The incentives the creation of small businesses as the spinoff emerged and today transformed business research with high earning potential, adding value to institutions, which in turn also profit because they are the basis of these developments. In Brazil, although there is great universities, incentives, investments and resources are still limited in relation to developed countries. Knowing the great need to implement an entrepreneurial and innovative policy in this country capable of promoting a capacity to give effective support in the areas of teaching, research and extension, as well as progress and encourage entrepreneurship, empower students to transform technological research in business, this study aims to analyze the differences between the entrepreneurial university in Brazil and practiced in the United States, while pointing out solutions to reduce the gap between the models. As a methodological approach, research has descriptive character and makes use of qualitative data obtained through a literature review. © 2017 revistaESPACIOS.com.

AB  - Research conducted at the university can have considerable commercial potential. However, turning those discoveries, innovations, and inventions into commercially viable products can prove extremely difficult. Based on a systematic review and narrative synthesis of the literature on translational research: the different models, its practice, and the efforts to streamline it, the author proposes a novel translational research & development framework to better link university science and engineering research to commercial outcomes, i.e., to create a more seamless transition from research to business. The author identified the best practices in translational research (as encountered mostly in biomedical research), adapted them for use in more general science and engineering research contexts, and combined them with well-established best practices in project management, new product development, business development, science of team science, and intellectual property management. The result is a robust, structured framework that can help university investigators bring their ideas to market. The proposed framework is also relevant to university investigators who might not intend to turn their early-stage innovations into businesses, but rather advance the development of the innovations to the point where they become attractive for others (e.g., entrepreneurs, industry), to embrace the challenge of developing the innovations further for the market. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays, E-Learning becomes a preferable medium for learning. Digital technology has made it more attractive and useful with additional user-friendly features. Basically, E-Learning involves massive infrastructural resources to operate. It also includes the effective combination of hardware and software along with the involvement of individuals to make the system successful for the students. Since the students and teachers have become agile using state-of-the-art communication technology in teaching learning process, they look for the efficient and smooth knowledge transfer. Many researches have encountered the barriers for the successful implementation of E-Learning in the universities. There is little research that uncovers the interaction of E-Learning barriers. The present study aims to provide the Interpretive Structure Modelling (ISM) and Matrice d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Applique'e a' un Classement (MICMAC) based analysis to study such barriers of E-Learning. A digraph representing ISM model has been established to help the stakeholders to understand the barriers to successful implementation of E-Learning. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The literature examining university spin-offs is expanding rapidly. While most studies have examined the antecedents of spin-off creation at universities, the impact of spin-offs commercializing university research cannot be properly assessed without considering how these firms develop, grow, and perform over time. This study provides a systematic review of a recent research stream addressing the development, growth, and performance of university spin-offs. By critically analyzing 105 research papers published since 2000, this paper makes two main contributions. First, we present a conceptual framework outlining the variety of outcomes used in the literature to assess the development, growth and performance of university spin-offs, as well as the determinants of these outcomes at different levels of analysis. Second, we critically assess gaps in the extant literature and discuss promising directions for future research. We conclude that the university spin-off phenomenon provides an excellent empirical context for conducting research that contributes to more general theoretical discussions related to entrepreneurship, innovation and management. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this digital age where state-of-the-art technologies are evolving swiftly, innovative learning pedagogies have to be accelerated to empower more effective knowledge transfer and engage in lifelong learning. The conventional e-learning approaches have become insufficient to handle the requirements of upgraded learning processes especially in the higher education. The emergence of Cloud computing delivers a significant breakthrough and has gained considerable acceptance in e-learning field. However, despite the readiness of Cloud infrastructures for collaboration and wide accessibility such as Web 2.0 tools, the progress of redefining learning objects to suit e-learning in Cloud environment is not so encouraging. So far, there has been rather little activity being carried out to ensure that e-learning applications are being designed in such a way that promote flexibility use of the learning content. With the availability of Internet and Cloud computing, an e-learning framework utilizing Cloud technology is envisioned. This paper describes a study on the effects of content design and usability on the acceptance of proposed Cloud-based e-learning framework. The study was conducted on a group of 350 IT undergraduates in one of the private universities in Malaysia to evaluate the acceptance of the proposed frameworks. The students were given one trimester to experience the usability of the learning modules developed based on the proposed Cloud-based e-learning framework. As an instrument to analyse the effects of content design and usability on the framework acceptance, a questionnaire consisting twenty four questions was devised and used. There are two independent variables, namely Content Design (CD) and Usability (U), and one dependent variable, namely Acceptance (A), in the research instrument. The results were analysed and reported by running the data in a few statistical tests using SMARTPLS 3.0. The results from this study observed that Cloud-based e-learning modules developed based on the proposed Cloud learning framework is positively accepted by IT undergraduates in the private university. This implies that the proposed Cloud-based e-learning framework can be engaged in the development of a new e-learning infrastructure or application in the future. © The Authors, 2018.

AB  - Universities have played a significant role in stimulating technological change and innovation, the focus has been commercialization of technical knowledge generated within science, technology and mathematics disciplines. Universities have increased disseminating knowledge as well as integration with industry in the form of entrepreneurial university. The transformation of university mission has supported university-industry-government interactions in creating commercial entrepreneurial spinoffs while it neglected to interact with a critical stakeholder of the university: society. To our knowledge, the transfer of knowledge generated within universities into social enterprises / social entrepreneurs has not been studied in the literature. This paper will present the gap in the literature review that might be an invitation for researchers to focus on the topic. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

AB  - Open innovation represents a present major strategy for companies aiming a development dynamic based on novelty. Open innovation highlights the concept of networking as enterprises position themselves in an inside and outside double process of knowledge acquisition and diffusion to foster their own new activities development and possibly those of their partners. This co-innovation approach may involve close known partners (customers, suppliers, regular interlocutors among others), entities purposely contacted (this includes academic structures specifically associated to a project, distant companies holding complementary know how and start-ups) and also occasional or fuzzy contributors (members of social networks, specialist mobilized by internet innovation intermediaries among others). Open innovation is associated with some theoretical problematic including the question of the necessary abilities of people in charge of this process. Beyond the technology and business competencies required within any innovation process, this paper focuses on possible complementary skills linked with the plurality of structures involved. The aim is to elaborate a competence’s list of reference dedicated to people piloting open innovation, and, to test this referential through new learning modules. The first step of the research consists in testing the hypothesis of the existence of specific open innovation management abilities. Based on a literature review and considering the work of the standard organization) in the field of innovation management (ISO/TC279), the research focuses on sensing practices that are typical of open innovation dynamics. These practices are then linked with a set of competences (knowledge and know how) thanks experts and company members interviews and according to a bibliographic analysis. Hence a competence referential is proposed for open innovation managers. In a second step, this referential has been valorized to design a new pedagogical module added to the syllabus of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure en Génie des Systèmes et de l’Innovation (ENSGSI) a French engineering school dedicated to innovation and management of technology. The paper gives the results of a two years’ experience about open innovation learning with students at final engineering level (master degree). The module uses the pedagogical concept of formative assessment: five evaluation sequences are integrated to the module. Each associating the students themselves, professors and employees of companies applying open innovation strategies. This transverse assessment is discussed all along the module by these three groups of people involved in order to get a continuous feedback. The outcomes of this evaluation process are detailed and analysed in constructivist terms: do the module gives students new abilities and are the competencies adapted to the launching phase of an open innovation process? In conclusion, the hypothesis of specific abilities relating to open innovation is validated. But the generic status of each of the competencies seems questionable. The wide range of openness situations suggests a necessary contextualization when identifying the pertinent targeted competencies of open innovation managers. © IAMOT 2019.

AB  - This article applies scientometric techniques to study the evolution of the field of entrepreneurship between 1990 and 2013. Using a combination of topic mapping, author and journal co-citation analyses, and overlay visualization of new and hot topics in the field, this article makes important contribution to the entrepreneurship research by identifying 46 topics in the 24-year history of entrepreneurship research and demonstrates how they appear, disappear, reappear and stabilize over time. It also identifies five topics that are persistent across the 24-year study period––institutions and institutional entrepreneurship, innovation and technology management, policy and development, entrepreneurial process and opportunity, and new ventures––which I labeled as The Pentagon of Entrepreneurship. Overall, the analyses revealed patterns of convergence and divergence and the diversity of topics, specialization, and interdisciplinary engagement in entrepreneurship research, thus offering the latest insights on the state of the art of the field. © 2018 Yanto Chandra.

AB  - Background: Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of death in children under age five. Healthcare policy and other decision-making relevant to PTB may rely on obsolete, incomplete or inapplicable research evidence, leading to worsened outcomes. Appropriate knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) strategies are an important component of efforts to reduce the global PTB burden. We sought to develop a 'landscape' analysis of KTE strategies currently used in PTB and related contexts, and to make recommendations for optimising programmatic implementation and for future research. Methods: In the University of California, San Francisco's Preterm Birth Initiative, we convened a multidisciplinary working group and examined KTE frameworks. After selecting a widely-used, adaptable, theoretically-strong framework we reviewed the literature to identify evidence-based KTE strategies. We analysed KTE approaches focusing on key PTB stakeholders (individuals, families and communities, healthcare providers and policymakers). Guided by the framework, we articulated KTE approaches that would likely improve PTB outcomes. We further applied the KTE framework in developing recommendations. Results: We selected the Linking Research to Action framework. Searches identified 19 systematic reviews, including two 'reviews of reviews'. Twelve reviews provided evidence for KTE strategies in the context of maternal, neonatal and child health, though not PTB specifically; seven reviews provided 'cross-cutting' evidence that could likely be generalised to PTB contexts. For individuals, families and communities, potentially effective KTE strategies include community-based approaches, 'decision aids', regular discussions with providers and other strategies. For providers, KTE outcomes may be improved through local opinion leaders, electronic reminders, multifaceted strategies and other approaches. Policy decisions relevant to PTB may best be informed through the use of evidence briefs, deliberative dialogues, the SUPPORT tools for evidence-informed policymaking and other strategies. Our recommendations for research addressed knowledge gaps in regard to partner engagement, applicability and context, implementation strategy research, monitoring and evaluation, and infrastructure for sustainable KTE efforts. Conclusions: Evidence-based KTE, using strategies appropriate to each stakeholder group, is essential to any effort to improve health at the population level. PTB stakeholders should be fully engaged in KTE and programme planning from its earliest stages, and ideally before planning begins. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Goal: This article aims to analyze the productions in scientific journals of international bases, in English, Portuguese or Spanish, about entrepreneurial university and third mission, focusing on the productions of Brazilian authors, through a systematic search of the literature. Design / Methodology / Approach: We use the SSF-Systematic Search Flow method, which is applied in systematic and integrative reviews. Results: An entrepreneurial university, committed to the development of its region, is the key factor in achieving regional innovation, a key institution in knowledge-based societies. In the age of knowledge, the university is as important as industry and government; fundamental for the development of knowledge and innovation. As a result, we identified research challenges and opportunities, contributing to the construction of a panorama of Brazilian scientific production in international journals on the themes entrepreneurial university and third mission. Limitations of the investigation: The most important limitation in this study was the long-time collection of research data. Practical implications: Universities must strengthen their relationship with industry and government to transfer knowledge and, at the same time, demonstrate their contribution to the community, fulfilling their third mission, as a vector for regional socioeconomic growth. Originality / Value: We see the opportunity to consolidate studies on the relationship between the third mission and the entrepreneurial university appropriate to the Brazilian reality. © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

AB  - This paper is an effort to develop an effective engineering education model in the university for a continuous Knowledge Creation (KC) and utilization. Universities are facing new issues due to the increase in distance & online education. Therefore, they are trying to attract and retain students by providing facilities like learning factory (LF). Learning factory being a platform for knowledge creation & learning, it also creates an environment for interaction between students, academics, and industrial participants. It is essential to understand how knowledge creation takes place within learning factory settings. Knowledge creation is a process of generation of new ideas, and studies are broadly within industrial organization thus ignoring educational context such as within university. Therefore, it is crucial for the university to take this challenge and address these gaps, which is above mentioned, i.e., identifying a model and its applicability. We have conducted qualitative research, which includes a detailed literature review, workshop, informal interview and focus group with participants. A literature review has shed lights on the advanced model of knowledge creation, and this model is based on a framework of the unified theory of dynamic knowledge creation through SECI mode, ‘Ba,' knowledge assets, and Leadership or simply known as Nonaka's model. The workshop reports on knowledge creation and applicability of this model in learning factory setting. The finding shows that a unified theory of dynamic knowledge creation model fits our existing learning factory setting with minor adjustments to serve our local industries. In summary, this paper applies the unified theory of dynamic knowledge creation model for the learning factory settings and from findings; it highlights the importance of the application of the knowledge creation to develop the education system and the role of management in learning factory settings. The results of this research should interest both management of university and industry for shaping their learning process and continuous knowledge creation. © 2018 Academic Conferences Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to understand, in the state of São Paulo academic environment, the differences between the profiles of academic entrepreneurs, nonacademic entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data from a more comprehensive research, whose objective was to evaluate the scholarship programmes of São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). For data collection, the authors used an online questionnaire, pre-filled with information from the Lattes Curriculum of the sample individuals, as well as information obtained from FAPESP and from coordination for the improvement of higher education personnel. The response rate of the questionnaires was 21 per cent. The authors sought to explore the variables regarding entrepreneurial activities carried out by former scholarship holders, by relating them to other key variables identified in the literature review and explained in the hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that entrepreneurship rates decrease with the higher academic level of the researcher; in general, academic entrepreneurs come from families with a good financial situation, and applied sciences are the areas of knowledge with more entrepreneurs. Originality/value: Despite the great number of theoretical and empirical studies found in the literature on entrepreneurship and academic entrepreneurship, there is still a shortage of practical studies on this latter topic in Brazil. This gap is even more evident when the authors consider the significant growth of entrepreneurial activity in the country in the past years. This paper contributes to fill this gap, and it aims to understand, in the state of São Paulo academic environment, the differences between the profiles of academic entrepreneurs, nonacademic entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. © 2018, Adriana Bin; Muriel de Oliveira Gavira; Jessica Botelho Figueira; Taynan Mariano Bezerra de Carvalho; Sergio Luiz Monteiro Salles-Filho and Fernando Antonio Basile Colugnati.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to carry out a literature review in order to know whether and to what extent the studies conducted so far have addressed relational capital in universities and, then, to provide a new framework for good practice that combines research, education, external universities (third mission) and internal relations. Our investigation aims to answer the following RQ: “How is relational capital formed in universities? How is it managed?” From a methodological point of view, we start with a literature review on relational capital and then we develop a case study. As far as the literature review is concerned, a search on Scopus was conducted, using a set of selected keywords, because it guarantees a high quality for publications. Selected papers have been analysed in an attempt to identify the main issues. The case study is a research strategy particularly suitable for an in-depth examination of current real-life events. The case chosen focuses on the foundation and development of the scientific observatory on gender issues entitled “Ipazia”. All relationships built in order to merge research, teaching and third mission within universities will be analysed and discussed. The analysed case study allows us to investigate whether and how the use of relational capital enables universities to combine research, education and third mission. Meanwhile, our research highlights how “Ipazia” can be seen as an activator of relationships for gender studies. Our research project aims to extend the analysis of relational capital in universities. This project could allow us to gain a greater understanding of a relevant subject, especially for those, scholars or politicians, who are involved in developing, managing and measuring relational capital in universities. Finally, this paper contributes to the expansion of the literature on gender studies, and for this reason, it offers a new perspective applied to a topic of high relevance such as relational capital in universities. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between two types of informal ties and radical innovation in the context of China’s university spin-offs and the moderating roles of knowledge breadth and depth in such relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature on informal ties, internal knowledge base and radical innovation provides the theoretical foundation of the research framework and hypotheses. Using a sample of 158 China’s university spin-offs, the authors conduct a regression analysis on the theoretical framework and hypotheses. Findings: The results show that business and university ties are positively related to radical innovation. Moreover, the effects of business and university ties on radical innovation are contingent on knowledge breadth and depth in opposite ways. In particular, the positive effect of business ties on radical innovation depends significantly on internal knowledge depth rather than on knowledge breadth, and the positive effect of university ties on radical innovation will be affected by internal knowledge breadth rather than knowledge depth. Practical implications: Managers of university spin-offs must examine informal ties they already have and identify their nature, content and embedded advantages and promptly adjust their strategy of informal ties to adapt to their firms’ internal knowledge base. Originality/value: This study highlights the positive role of managers’ personal connections with different external parties in facilitating radical innovation and advances the understanding of informal ties by proposing that the effects of informal ties on radical innovation are contingent on a firm’s internal knowledge base in the context of China’s university spin-offs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: First, to review the state-of-the-art in patent citation analysis, particularly characteristics of patent citations to scientific literature (scientific non-patent references, SNPRs). Second, to present a novel mapping approach to identify technology-relevant research based on the papers cited by and referring to the SNPRs. Design/methodology/approach: In the review part we discuss the context of SNPRs such as the time lags between scientific achievements and inventions. Also patent-to-patent citation is addressed particularly because this type of patent citation analysis is a major element in the assessment of the economic value of patents. We also review the research on the role of universities and researchers in technological development, with important issues such as universities as sources of technological knowledge and inventor-author relations. We conclude the review part of this paper with an overview of recent research on mapping and network analysis of the science and technology interface and of technological progress in interaction with science. In the second part we apply new techniques for the direct visualization of the cited and citing relations of SNPRs, the mapping of the landscape around SNPRs by bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis, and the mapping of the conceptual environment of SNPRs by keyword co-occurrence analysis. Findings: We discuss several properties of SNPRs. Only a small minority of publications covered by the Web of Science or Scopus are cited by patents, about 3%-4%. However, for publications based on university-industry collaboration the number of SNPRs is considerably higher, around 15%. The proposed mapping methodology based on a "second order SNPR approach"enables a better assessment of the technological relevance of research. Research limitations: The main limitation is that a more advanced merging of patent and publication data, in particular unification of author and inventor names, in still a necessity. Practical implications: The proposed mapping methodology enables the creation of a database of technology-relevant papers (TRPs). In a bibliometric assessment the publications of research groups, research programs or institutes can be matched with the TRPs and thus the extent to which the work of groups, programs or institutes are relevant for technological development can be measured. Originality/value: The review part examines a wide range of findings in the research of patent citation analysis. The mapping approach to identify a broad range of technology-relevant papers is novel and offers new opportunities in research evaluation practices.  © 2017 Anthony F.J. van Raan.

AB  - When dealing with complex software systems, models that conform to different modeling languages are used to describe these systems from various perspectives. This is even more prevalent for Systems of Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems, because of multi-disciplinary co-engineering processes. Such situations often lead to information scattering across many heterogeneous and interconnected models, or to overlappings and redundancies that may create inconsistencies in system descriptions. Thus, engineers may have difficulties to efficiently comprehend the studied systems as they need to explore all these models in full detail. View-based approaches in software engineering have been proposed to tackle these issues. They mostly follow a strategy of proposing a fixed set of predefined viewpoints to be used in different application domains or scenarios. This offers several advantages such as improved understanding, or more integrated and comprehensive tool support. However, these approaches lack the flexibility required in many scenarios where the useful model views go beyond a limited set of viewpoints, and may change over time as the development process moves on. Recent advances in model-based engineering have fostered the possibility of having more flexible view-based approaches, based on metamodeling and model transformation techniques for instance. These model view approaches typically support the creation of custom views over heterogeneous models. However they differ in their mechanisms to create such views (calculated on-demand, stored as separate models, etc.), the expressivity of the view definition language, the support for view updates, etc. Given the plethora of existing approaches-most of them only providing partial solutions-it is difficult to know how each approach compares to the others and what are their respective trade-offs. This makes it difficult to identify which one(s) may be better suited for given needs, thus hampering the usefulness of such model views approaches in practice. In this paper, we provide orientation via an extended study of the state-of-the-art in the area of model viewpoints/views. We believe this research line is becoming more and more crucial not only for the modeling community, but also from a more general software and systems engineering perspective. Thus, we motivate why many future applications of modeling will depend, one way or the other, on some kind of mechanism for dealing with viewpoints/views on models. Furthermore, we describe what are the solutions available at the time of writing and how they currently compare to each other. To this intent, we categorize them according to a detailed feature model that aims to shed more light on this topic. Finally, we propose a research agenda highlighting related challenges we have identified as important to tackle in the future. In addition to overall scalability issues, such challenges includes (i) dealing with terminology problems that quite often hamper the combination and reuse of existing initiatives, (ii) addressing the well-know but still complex view updating problem(s), (iii) better supporting incremental view maintenance in the general case, (iv) improving the generation of adapted view concrete syntaxes, and (v) working on security-related aspects (e.g., view access control). This paper acts as an entry point for both academic researchers and industrial practitioners, and intends to trigger a broader discussion within the community. This should allow enriching our current feature model and extending the approach comparison in the future. Most importantly, we hope this work will raise the awareness on research challenges around viewpoints/views on models and their practical usages. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - To enable the transition to renewable and sustainable energy systems, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)can successfully commercialize new technologies, yet doing so is highly challenging. Moreover, governmental policy makers tend to support measures for early-stage ventures or university spin-offs, based on the assumption that sustainable energy technologies primarily arise from early-stage technology development. Attention has recently been shifting to SMEs, which can help accelerate the energy transition. By combining a literature review with an explorative multiple case study of 20 SMEs in the Dutch sustainable energy sector, this article identified barriers and drivers for technology commercialization by SMEs. A country-specific barrier is the large consumption of natural gas by Dutch households, which strongly inhibits the successful scale-up of new technologies. The study found several managerial, financial, technological and policy-related barriers and drivers which affect technology commercialization of sustainable energy technologies by SMEs. These barriers and drivers were further assessed in an actor-based analysis, which suggests that the various barriers and drivers arise from the interactions between policy makers, industry partners and end-users. The paper also discusses the policy implications of the barriers and drivers identified, and outlines several challenges for future research. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - The main objective of this study is to summarise and analyse the level of scientific interest from researchers from the Baltic Sea Region in interacting with each other on scientific and research projects in university-industry interaction field. This study will use bibliometric analysis based on actual joint initiatives and their published results. The growth of interest from both universities and industry in joint initiatives and changes in the nature of their cooperation (Butcher & Jeffren, 2005) has led to a significant increase in the Baltic Region and the number of scientific publications has doubled in the years 2010-2014. However, compared to the number of similar published studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Japan, those results far outnumber the achievements of the Baltic regions. At the same time, there has been significant increase in the number of studies undertaken by Sweden, Germany and Finland in the period from 2012 to 2014, facilitated by active international and interdisciplinary cooperation and involvement in the research by a large number of authors. The results of the evaluation indicators through this bibliometric analysis can assist in the specific targeting and allocation of available finance and funding into promising fields of research and aid in communication and cooperation between stakeholders and interested organisations. © 2017 Elena Murashova et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2017.

AB  - Colombia as state is emerging its space capacity, by considering the formulation and implementation of several active initiatives, in both civil and defense domains. The country made an early entry in the small satellite scene with the launch of its first academic 1U nanosatellite - Libertad 1 - in 2008. More recently, the Colombian Air Force launched its first educational 3U advanced nanosatellite - FACSAT1, in November 2018. The mentioned projects have contributed as the initial building blocks of the future capacity in this matter, in order to project Colombia as a space-faring nation and leader in the Latin American region, by considering its strategic geographical position and the composition of its human critical mass. The Colombian Air Force, through its FACSAT small satellite educational program, is allocating budget and coordinating efforts involving national universities, different government agencies, civil authorities, and Minister of Defense actors, to strengthen the national policy while the next generations of small satellites will be launched into orbit. What is more, an intense technology transfer program is underway through international cooperation to acquire state-of-the-art know-how and ensure implementation of best practices. The strategy above described is followed in many emerging and developing countries, where military forces can act as the best-input channel for international cooperation and drive the creation of space capabilities and know-how. This applies not only for national defense, but also for other usages such as research in different topics in terms of climate change effects, whether, agriculture, and so on. The FACSAT small satellite educational program is a long-term investment that aims at developing all the capacities needed to give Colombia frequent access to space. This paper will present an overview, the context of the country and the efforts undertaken with respect to national policy, regulatory matters, academic outreach, R&D capacity building, as well as the general defense framework allowing this to happen. Besides, it will also feature a focused presentation of the FACSAT1 and FACSAT2 Earth Observation projects. These two first projects are contributing and benefiting the Colombian society, especially from the processing and exploitation of imagery, to convey services with great value in different arenas, as never done before.

AB  - The world population is increasingly urbanized. There is a need to analyze current smart urban challenges and opportunities, and to study how to incorporate smart systems into an agenda of urban competitiveness. The smart city approach is a recent theme, aiming at improving the quality of life of citizens in urban territories. Born like a bottom-up movement, it is now becoming critical in urban planning and development in cities all over the world. The smart city success depends on how cities achieve higher innovation profiles and competitiveness levels – on being entrepreneurial smart cities. Universities are one of the most significant cities’ agents on building up active strategies to reinforce an entrepreneurial urban dynamics. Grounded on a vast and deep literature review on both scientific papers and practitioner or institutional reports, the paper tries to address the role the entrepreneurial university might bring to the formulation and implementation of smart cities strategies, pointing out to some instruments that can be used to enhance urban competitiveness and sustainability. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - An entrepreneur is a key to initiating entrepreneurial activities. Various countries have taken different steps for promoting technopreneurship. On this backdrop we have attempted to explore the promotional efforts in various countries and the factors which enhance propensity of technopreneurial activities. To address these research questions, we have identified research articles on technopreneurship in different countries and systematically reviewed them. Few European countries have begun providing entrepreneurship education at the higher stages of academia. In some nations governing bodies are set up to help budding entrepreneur grow their business, incubators are set up in various national institutes, and the concept of the entrepreneurial university has also emerged. Investment in Research and Development has also been looked as initiating step for technopreneurship in many countries. This will create an ecosystem of technopreneurship and will help improve the economy of a nation by generating more number of jobs after setting up of more number of MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) in the field of high technology. These programs are also likely to help an individual think more towards the improvement of the community and not only about profit making. We have found that the efforts by various countries are dependent on their regional priorities. However, there is more which can be done to research the key issues for not getting the desired impact of such programs. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Literature has been paying greater attention to the main drivers of academic researchers’ engagement with industrial partners. However, there is a lack of understanding of how academic researchers’ perceived outcomes and constraints affect their collaboration with firms. The novelty of this article is its analysis of how researchers’ perception of the benefits, results, and Barriers associated with collaboration affects academic research groups’ engagement with industry. We use a comprehensive database on University–industry collaboration from a survey with academic researcher groups in Brazil, and we use a time lag to analyse the number of collaboration of the research groups. We find that perceived intellectual benefits and commercial results are important drivers for researchers’ engagement with industry, and economic benefits and transactional Barriers are obstacles to increase collaborative projects with firms. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In the knowledge society, universities have assumed new missions and relations in order to contribute to economic and social development, while preserving their own sustainability. This article aims to explore scientific literature on innovation and entrepreneurship in the academic setting, describing how the field is organized, main terms and definitions, theoretical frameworks, and empirical models, in order to direct future research. A systematic literature review was conducted, in which articles indexed at Web of Science were initially submitted to a bibliometric analysis. Then, the content of a set of articles best fitting the objectives of the study was analyzed. Bibliometric analysis shows an increasing literature, with publications over more than 40 years. There are studies from many disciplines, with those in business and economics prevailing, mainly related to management and originating from the USA and Europe. Content analysis shows a fragmented literature, with definitions not showing a clear relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship, or their use within universities in coherence with their traditional definitions. Both theoretical frameworks and empirical models are very heterogeneous, but four groups of studies were identified based on their theoretical frameworks, and also based on their empirical models. With only a few exceptions, empirical models do not share many components and variables, and there are no clear boundaries between the different models. Despite the increasing literature, it is still fragmented and undertheorized, requiring more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the economic and the social aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship within universities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Developments in the fields of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) are continuous and new innovative technological solutions for the provision of more accurate and trustworthy feedback are employed on a regular basis. The last decade, the European Union has funded more than 140 million euros for research in innovative ITS and C-ITS technologies through the HORIZON 2020 funding mechanism.Taking into account the significance of ITS and C-ITS technologies, in the frameworks of the CAPITAL project, an ITS knowledge database has been introduced in order for a common framework to be provided for the deployment of ITS and C-ITS. The ITS knowledge database is presented in the form of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) through the CAPITAL Online Training Platform, developed in the standards of other online training platforms. The solution of MOOCs has been chosen due to the fact that more and more platforms, either university platforms or not, are already introduced for providing educational programs.The ITS knowledge database consists of nine independent topic studies, with each one aiming to describe the current state of the art of ITS and C-ITS. The aforementioned topic studies are the following:•Introduction to ITS and C-ITS.•ITS and C-ITS user services.•TMC and roadside technologies for ITS.•Communication technologies for ITS and C-ITS including relevant standards.•Impact assessment of ITS and impacts of selected ITS and C-ITS systems•Financial incentives, business models and procurement models for C-ITS deployment.•Cost-benefit analyses of ITS services.•Guidance in deploying ITS and C-ITS.•Data protection and privacy.The topic studies mainly take the form of literature reviews and they are presented as video lectures. They address all ITS stakeholders, divided by their know-how level into three categories: 1st level ITS start-up communities, 2nd level intermediary communities and 3rd level professional users. The educational and informational material is customized for each individual know-how level. Every trainee has the possibility to evaluate the concept of online training tools as well as the effectiveness of this specific tool both before and after the attendance to each course. Moreover, various quizzes have been developed based on the material of each lecture separately in order to measure the level of knowledge and the information that the trainees gain after each lecture.Within this paper, a first thorough analysis of the feedback of the participants-trainees is being presented and a consequent evaluation of the effectiveness of the platform is being executed in order to identify the efficiency and the success of such an online tool. The level of awareness and demand for ITS technologies is being measured through descriptive statistics that conclude to useful results for both the material of the courses as well as the usefulness of an online training tool for ITS. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Universities are now viewed as key economic actors within regions and are central actors in shaping and influencing entrepreneurial ecosystems. This has meant that universities now have to become more entrepreneurial in offerings, outlook and culture. However, a core actor in this process who is often overlooked is the academic. The ability of an academic to effectively transfer knowledge to industry is key to universities achieving their entrepreneurial mission and ambition. This paper explores the changing roles of academics to identify key distinctions between entrepreneurial academics and academic entrepreneurs. This is done through a systematic literature review spanning 25 years drawing on selected high impact journals in innovation, entrepreneurship and higher education studies. We categorise the types of activity that academics typically engage in and identify the motivations and challenges they face. From this, we identify two types of academics, the entrepreneurial academic and academic entrepreneur. We posit that there is a need for both types of academics to contribute to the success of the entrepreneurial university and conclude by outlining some avenues for future research.

AB  - Purpose: The collaborative work between universities and enterprises is increasingly important given the growing competitive environment, transformed by intense global competition, rapid technological change and shorter product life cycles. In this article several case studies are analysed, as well as relevant academic literature, to get an insight concerning the current relationship status between enterprises and universities. Methodology/Approach: The methodology is grounded on the literature review on University-Industry Partnerships, selected from indexed sources, and targeted to case-based experiences where practical feedback is given. Findings: It is shown that university-industry knowledge transfer contributes significantly to an increase of quality, productivity and economic value of businesses. It is found that the lack of controlling mechanisms and lack of efficient communication paths have a strong negative impact in collaboration. Key collaboration factors that support stronger relationships were compiled and discussed in support of better mitigation strategies. Research Limitation/implication: The limited availability of case studies reporting on operative improvements introduced by policy changes hinders the effectiveness of the findings. Originality/Value of paper: The paper analyses the collaboration of the university with industry based on case studies with a focus on value creation and how to gain a competitive advantage through collaboration.

AB  - Universities are increasingly recognised as key actors in the knowledge-based urban development process, occupying a crucial role of knowledge creators and transmitters. This paper takes a critical view of these roles and reviews the extant literature to present a synopsis of relevant work examining universities and open innovation, the uncertainties involved in the process of knowledge transfer, and the spatial scope of university-industry links. The paper proposes a number of areas for future development: Understanding the heterogeneity of universities and how this influences their potential roles in knowledge-based urban development; a better understanding of how uncertainties in the partner selection process may prevent efficient university-industry collaboration to promote knowledge-based urban development; further exploration of the micro-level processes involved in knowledge transfer between universities and firms; and a broader understanding of the roles of proximities in facilitating these links. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In the field of international human resource management, a widely held assumption identifies expatriation as a completely enriching experience which provides employees with knowledge of high value and contributes to enhancing general management capacity [24]. This research investigates the effect of expatriation on knowledge transfer as a driver for innovation and performance. The study uses the case of international faculty in a higher education institution to shed light on the interplay between sharing international experiences, facilitating knowledge transfer, and generating value. Following a thorough literature review, research on knowledge transfer processes within the education sector remains limited. We still have little guidance on the mechanisms enabling knowledge transfer inside universities, particularly when promoting faculty mobility or hiring international faculty and researchers. This research adopts a single case study method while using Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, an international higher education institution, as a context of investigation. The study involved international faculty from the schools of engineering, business, and humanities and also Moroccan faculty who received their education abroad to explore the processes of experience and knowledge sharing among diverse workforce and how such processes could lead to creating a space for knowledge transfer that enables in turn better innovation and performance. The findings of this research show the limited knowledge transfer dynamics inside internationally-oriented higher education institutions and demonstrate the importance of adopting human resource development practices as facilitating mechanisms to support knowledge transfer while involving and benefitting various stakeholders. The study suggests different developmental venues for universities to support knowledge transfer from international faculty including teamwork, training and faculty orientation, collaborative research projects, resources and incentives, and industry-oriented educational and consulting programs. This research has the potential to lay the foundations of a theoretical framework integrating knowledge transfer and value generation dynamics within the context of higher education. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - The study of institutional change is a core research area in organization theory and is of increasing relevance for scholarship in other disciplines. In this article, we review the substantial number of studies that have examined the ways by which institutions are created, modified, or transformed, highlighting the lack of integration of prior works that emphasize exogenous shocks, institutional entrepreneurship, and practice-based change. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, we then develop a novel typology of pathways of change that more comprehensively brings together this diverse literature, accounts for the richness and heterogeneity of institutional change processes unveiled by studies to date, and provides a more synthetic framework to guide future research. Based on our analysis and theorizing, we discuss important new scholarly directions that will enhance our understanding of different kinds of institutional change processes and outcomes, as well as contribute to further development of the institutional logics perspective. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a justified, legitimate and validated model on entrepreneurship education programmes (EEPs), by combining recent research and scholarship in leading edge entrepreneurship education (EE). Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of recent EE research and scholarship is followed by an empirical study to develop a model of EEPs. This was adopted by employing an emergent inquiry perspective incorporating participatory action research, using frame analysis and NVIVO to develop and analyse themes. Findings: This research identified three unique dimensions currently excluded from the theoretical and scholarship of EEPs, being distinct contextualisation, entrepreneurship ecosystems and recent content innovation in entrepreneurship. It also identified updates to current EEPs dimensions, such as online technologies, authentic alignment, causation, effectuation and bricolage, technology transfer the entrepreneurial university. Research limitations/implications: The discussion and model presented in this paper may be a starting point for future empirical studies on EEPs, by developing additional validation, justification and legitimisation. Practical implications: The study indicates that EEPs are integrative and dynamic, and always limited to contextual and contemporary inferences; providing guidance to developing such programmes. Hence, the applicability to update the original framework developed by Maritz and Brown (2013) as Part 2 of illuminating the black box of EEPs. Originality/value: This paper provides a first of its kind empirical study in the development of EEPs frameworks and models, deepening the theory, scholarship and development of such models. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Academic entrepreneurship and the process of establishing new firms are rooted in technologies and knowledge resulting from the research carried out at universities. Thus, they have served as engines of growth in the USA since the Bay-Dole Act, and presently Europe and China are trying to catch up. The article aims at recommending a research agenda at the intersection of the functions of knowledge transfer from universities from the perspective of academic entrepreneurship and the role of universities' third mission. Talent management teams are crucial to managing knowledge and technology transfer successfully in today's global world. Hence, research on this intersection should endeavor to find out antecedents, consequents and the processes of how the talented people clustered in detached teams, the human capital of spin-offs and born global organizations can become the source of competitive advantage as regards managing entrepreneurship within the university. The literature review search was conducted in SSCI-Web of Science Core Collection databases focusing on journal articles and review with the limitation that conference papers, books and other scientific contributions not abstracted there were not included. © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

AB  - In the age of New Space, the number of small satellites launched is growing rapidly and it is projected up to 7,000 small satellites are to be launched by 2027. Although majority of these satellites are planned to be manufactured in advanced countries, growing number of developing countries are expected to join the wave as well. There have been many advanced countries and companies willing to provide training and technology transfer to new entrants who do not have domestic capability. However, most of emerging countries are still experiencing difficulties in establishing sustainable self-standing capability. This presentation is about the journey of Satrec Initiative (SI), a small satellite company from Korea, spun-off from a university research center which also started as a recipient of space technologies. It is about the lessons learned along the journey, and how SI moved on to become a donor by exporting and transferring space technologies. The early members have acquired the seed technologies from the universities in the UK, US, and Japan. After 30 years, SI has become one of the most important small satellite companies in the world developing wide range of technologies: from world-class Earth observation satellites to state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms for satellite imagery analytics.

AB  - How actors embedded in institutions can change those institutions is known as the paradox of embedded agency. Although academic interest in embedded agency has increased in recent years, what enables actors to engage in embedded agency is still not well understood. One resource that may assist actors in realising embedded agency and overcoming political resistance by opponents to change is management accounting, as management accounting can—among other functions—serve as an important information resource for actors willing to engage in embedded agency. Although the existing literature may not explicitly refer to embedded agency, published research studies are likely to already contain some evidence of the role of management accounting as a resource in institutional work. Thus, this study seeks to survey and re-analyse the existing literature for evidence regarding how management accounting may be used as a political resource that enables embedded agency. For this purpose, the study uses systematic literature review methods and demonstrates why and how management accounting may serve as a political resource in institutional change. The study develops six roles concerning how management accounting may be used as a political resource in the identification of a need for and gaining others’ support for and the implementation of institutional change. It further shows that management accounting may be at interplay with other factors in enabling embedded agency. Finally, the review findings suggest that management accounting may be an important resource not only in legitimising institutional change ex post but also in identifying the need for change, gaining others’ support for change and implementing change. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper explores how sustainability can be achieved through open innovation in the current 4th industrial revolution. Through a literature and practice review, we identify micro- and macro-dynamics of open innovation in addition to the dynamic roles of industry, government, university, and society. In particular, the industry continuously adopts open platforms to create and maintain ecosystem innovation. The government's role has changed from regulation control toward facilitation. Universities have become proactively engaged in multiple areas, from technology transfer to knowledge co-creation. Societies and customers have started to form new concepts, R & D, and commercialization, resulting in a shared economy. Based on the analysis, we propose a conceptual framework to understand open innovation micro- and macro-dynamics with a quadruple-helix model for social, environmental, economic, cultural, policy, and knowledge sustainability. Furthermore, this provides an overview of the special issue, "Sustainability of Economy, Society, and Environment in the 4th Industrial Revolution", which aims to respond to the 4th industrial revolution in terms of open innovation and cyber-physics from manufacturing to the service industry. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Information is valuable to decision makers in both public and private sectors. The New Public Management (NPM) reform in the public sector has stressed the importance of performance information to politicians, public managers, and citizens. Information economics has acknowledged the meaning of information as a market determinant. However, as a discipline, information economics has not developed a cost concept that describes the negative value of an incorrect decision caused by the non-use or misuse of information. A systematic theoretical approach describing the factors causing such non-use or misuse is also currently missing in information economics. This article aims to fill these two research gaps. It defines infonomic costs (ICs) as the negative value of information non-use or misuse, denoting the benefits lost by the decision maker. By conducting an exploratory literature review, another new concept called the information expectation gap (IEG) is created to depict why the non-use or misuse leading to ICs occurs. The IEG also explains how information and knowledge asymmetries come into existence. The conceptual work presented here offers novel understanding and terminology to both academics and practitioners. Practitioners can utilize the IEG concept in information system management because it displays several dysfunctions that they may face in their information systems. For academics, this research opens up new theoretical conversations about the different types of information system dysfunctions that cause market errors and adverse policy decisions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In recent years, universities have focused more on the creation of spin-off companies as a means of transferring the knowledge generated by their research activities. At the same time, this has generated an increase in academic research on this business structure in order to identify the best strategies for their management and the most efficient university policies, amongst other things. In this study, we have identified and evaluated the literature on university spin-offs published in journals included in the Social Sciences Citation Index of the Web of Science in order to identify what, by whom, where and how it has been researched. The number of studies was marginal until 2000 but has grown exponentially since 2010. Our systematic review classifies research findings into three levels—individual, firm, and institutional context—each with respect to characteristics, antecedents, and outcomes of entrepreneurial activities. Reviewing the content of these articles allows some gaps in the research to be identified and conclusions to be reached about possible future research in this field to supplement, update and extend the results obtained to date. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative is a paramount national strategy of China, which greatly promotes the technical innovations like those in the nuclear energy industry. The Chinese HPR1000 reactor, with independent intellectual property rights, has been exported to various countries all over the world. China's nuclear energy industry is undergoing a rapid development, which demands large numbers of experts specializing in the nuclear energy. Thus, qualified PhD students play a pivotal role in this process. Moreover, the nuclear energy industry encounters ceaseless real-world state-of-the-art problems, and academic researches generally feed on them that would finally become the PhD students' theses and dissertations. Therefore, the paradigm for intimate university-industry partnership is required. The university-industry collaboration system provides an effective approach to cultivating high-level talents for the nuclear energy industry. Since 1996, Tsinghua University (THU) has cooperated with companies such as China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to enroll 60 students orientated to the nuclear energy industry every year, approximately10%-15% of which would subsequently pursue doctoral degrees. This paper will illustrate, build, optimize and investigate the training mode for PhD students majoring in the nuclear science and engineering based on the university-industry collaboration system in THU. The newly established training mode includes some vital elements like the nine-year persistent system, four-supervisor cooperative cultivation and project-oriented exploratory research.

AB  - Many businesses seeking enhanced innovation have corporate research teams that engage in collaborative research projects (CRPs), with external entities such as universities, public organizations, or customers. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests mixed outcomes of CRPs in terms of corporate research impact, which implies successful transfer of novel knowledge generated within CRPs to company-internal business networks to develop radically innovative products. We use the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP) and meta-analysis to analyze six CRP networks. Our findings indicate that the network’s relational characteristics (tie strength) and structural characteristics (network range) are important determinants of knowledge transfer at the fuzzy front end of innovation. © 2018 Project Management Institute, Inc.

AB  - This article provides a critical review and discussion of current literature on technology transfer, incubators, and academic entrepreneurship. Drawing upon the notion of robustness in social systems and public choice theory, we review, code, and taxonomize 166 studies to assess the likelihood that these initiatives will generate innovation and economic growth. We find that academic entrepreneurship initiatives are characterized by conflicting goals, weak incentive structures for universities and academics, and are contextually dependent upon factors such as university strength. Our results suggest that there are critical boundary conditions that are unlikely to be fulfilled when universities and policymakers enact policies to support academic entrepreneurship initiatives. Policymakers therefore need to be cautious in the potential design of such initiatives. We discuss how technology transfer from universities might be better achieved through alternative mechanisms such as contract research, licensing, consulting and increased labor mobility among researchers. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Universities, colleges, and other learning institutions receive funding for research studies and data collection involving laboratory and field site work. Students are hired to work in the laboratory or field to gain experience, fulfill their educational requirements, and reduce the financial burden for their education. The safety of student researchers is commonly regarded as a top priority and is an important part of their education for their future careers. While on-campus laboratory safety for students is commonly stressed by many universities, field site safety is rarely mentioned. A study led by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) was conducted with assistance from Oregon State University (OSU) and Portland State University (PSU) to create a safety training manual and video for student workers and researchers who perform roadway engineering fieldwork. The study revealed safety education and training needs for students. To carry out field data collection, students may be required to work on a roadway, in the right-of-way, or close to live-traffic environments. Workers and researchers present on roadways are exposed to hazardous conditions which present the need for safety training to increase the skill level, hazard awareness, risk perception, and quick reactions of those conducting work operations. Unlike work conducted by permanent employees, work conducted by student workers and researchers typically involves temporary, short-term assignments, so students often only receive informal safety training when required to collect data in the field. Formal safety training resources are needed to provide students - who are the future employees of the transportation industry - with adequate knowledge and skills to ensure that they know how to work safely on roadways. This paper describes current practices related to student worker safety training and the results of a survey conducted to collect the perspectives of onsite engineers and experienced managers on student safety training needs. Conclusions and recommendations are reported based on safety training in university curricula, a comprehensive literature review, and the survey results. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Universities are facing the challenge of updating the contents of their current study programs and adopting novel education strategies in order to prepare the next generation of engineers who can adapt to the highly competitive labor market of Industry 4.0. This new industrial era requires skills and competencies in state-of-the-art technologies which are constantly and rapidly evolving. This research presents an alternative approach to the current teaching–learning methodologies, focusing on the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as an educational tool and its contribution towards the upcoming industrial challenges, via what we call interactive education for future engineers (IE). Our IE strategy is supported by interactive simulation using the latest VR technologies, currently being Facebook’s Oculus Rift hardware and software. With this approach, we seek to enhance the “know-how” of our students by training them in the practical skills they will need for the technological innovations of the evolving labor market. Our work has been implemented in engineering courses at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, aligning with the university’s educational model “TEC21” which aims to increase the students’ self-learning capabilities using interactive teaching and hands-on practical work to develop new abilities and competencies in an expanded variety of domains. So far, our results have shown that the use of IE not only improves the way professors teach, but reinforces skills, competencies, enhances creativity and strongly motivates the students in their daily learning. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Long-term physical, cognitive, and psychosocial problems resulting from moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) can prevent individuals from returning to preinjury lifestyles because of significant challenges with employment, leisure, and relationships. While physical activity (PA) is proposed as a cost-effective method to alleviate problems after moderate to severe TBI, there is no review to date that synthesizes the evidence for PA in the community-based context. Further, although sex- A nd gender-based considerations in research are considered requisite to good science, there is no review on PA and TBI that has included this explicit focus. Objective: The purpose of this review is to map and synthesize the current evidence identified through a systematic search of community-based PA interventions for individuals of all ages with moderate to severe TBI and provide an overview of that evidence by asking the following research questions: (1) what are the characteristics of community-based PA programs for individuals with moderate to severe TBI, (2) what are the reported health-related outcomes and measurement tools used to evaluate them, and (3) what considerations have been given to sex and/or gender? Methods: Searches will be conducted of six academic databases for peer-reviewed articles. Two reviewers will independently screen the articles for inclusion and extract data for the analysis. The extracted data will be coded according to the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template checklist and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist to provide sufficient detail for replication. Results: The abstract screening was completed by two reviewers and the extracted data were analyzed. A qualitative synthesis and description of community-based PA interventions for individuals with moderate to severe TBI will be provided. Conclusions: This scoping review will generate new knowledge from published and publicly available literature. Dissemination of the results will include activities related to knowledge transfer for community-based PA after moderate to severe TBI for future research and practice. Evidence-based recommendations, future directions, potential limitations, use of online/digital components, and the possible need for a systematic review will be discussed as well. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - In the modern age of Industry 4.0 and manufacturing servitisation, energy saving and environment consciousness are regarded as vital themes in manufacturing processes to reduce carbon tax and achieve sustainable development. For the past 20 years, the concept of green manufacturing has grown from infancy to a fully formed framework agreed upon by world-leading enterprises. With the unprecedented development of the information technology today, the industrial data collected could assist in the in-depth study on green manufacturing, which ranges from the operations of machining tools all the way to supply chain management. The wide scope of research promises a tremendous amount of annual publications in this field. To better facilitate follow-up research work, the present study provides a systematic overview of green manufacturing-related areas, including research progress and the developed features. The article set retrieved from the Web of Science contains 5989 documents related to green manufacturing. It is revealed that Journal of Cleaner Production is the most productive journal, archiving documents within the scope of green manufacturing. P. R. China tops the list of the number of documents with 1357 documents (22.66%), while Zhejiang University is the most productive institution. As the cooperation network indicates, P. R. China and the United States maintain the strongest collaborative links with other countries/regions. Finally, possible future directions are recommended based on the findings in the study. For instance, additive manufacturing technology and industrial IoT both have a great potential in green manufacturing; the weak link between the disciplines of manufacturing engineering and environmental science is expected to be strengthened, and a stronger international cooperation is believed to be beneficial to the field for the otherwise isolated countries/regions. © 2021 Zhejiang University of Technology.

AB  - Social entrepreneurship (SE) had been introduced in the university as one of the efforts to nurture future social entrepreneurs. SE courses established at the university level with a combination of cooperation from the local community and industry give a more effective impact on the local community. The knowledge and skills taught from universities regardless of the academic or cultural background can be used to balance the social problems in the community with the development of social innovation to solve the issues. However, several challenges delayed further development of a successful SE programme in higher education. This research employs the systematic literature review (SLR) which utilizes in-depth and absolute evaluation of related literature on the research topic. Four challenges have been encountered include; the design of SE curricula, financial and funding problems, lack of professionals to teach SE courses, and prohibitive social and university environment issues. This research has also suggested some best practices include; more SE awareness programmes, university management in solving funding problems, preparing SE coaching professionals, and setting up more university-industry collaborations. This paper proposes suggestions to counter the challenges and leverage the social network as an innovative technological alternative and giving more opportunities for improved social benefits. © 2020 National Institute of Education, Singapore.

AB  - University-Industry collaborations in R&D have grown significantly in recent years. In more developed economies, governments encourage, by finance, collaboration and the exchange of knowledge between private industry and universities. However, it is still a challenge for organizations and universities to identify the best practices adopted to establish and sustain collaboration. This has led to the growing need to establish practices and principles to guide the initiation, implementation and assessment of successful collaboration. Therefore, maturity models can be a way of establishing and sustaining collaboration as it helps organizations and universities to evaluate their processes against best practices and propose actions for improvement. This paper introduces preliminary results of ongoing research to create a maturity model for the sustainable university-industry relationship. This model based literature review and on a six-year experience of the relationship between the University of Minho and Bosch Car Multimedia (Braga). © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The paper investigates the types of academic consulting practices being done across the world based on the systematic review literature. The paper aims to propose a theoretical framework of academic consulting and also discusses various factors and sub-factors that influence academic consulting. Strong literature support was found for these factors and subfactors. This paper proposes several hypotheses that establish the key relationships between the factors and academic consulting and the key innovative output of the consulting method. The proposed theoretical framework exhibits how the consulting method having impacts on the institution, industry, and individual. To test the theoretical framework, we conducted a pilot survey by taking 100 respondents from academic institutions (PhD research scholars, assistant professors, associate professors, professors) in four metropolitan cities of India and also researchers who are in research and development (R&D) units of any industry and applied chi-square test on the collected data and results validate the theoretical framework of the consulting method. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

AB  - The underlying challenges of knowledge management and technology transfer and their respective contributions to the development of society are well-known and widely discussed issues in business management. This paper aims to (1) build on the state-of-the art literature on knowledge management and technology transfer, (2) to identify the most relevant, recent studies, and main researchers working on the field worldwide, and (3) to unveil topics of recent development in the field, as well as overlap the themes. To this end, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and Scopus databases were screened for studies that explored the relevance of knowledge management and technology transfer. This research focused on the most recent studies comprising the periods of 2013–2018, while employing Metodi Ordinatio as a quality ranking method, producing thus 50 studies submitted for further analysis and appraisal. The study sought to analyze the co-occurrence of keywords on the theme, the number of citations, number of publications per country, year and journal, and the overlap between areas. This paper also enabled an analysis of the steps required for knowledge management and their relationship to technology transfer. The results showed that most studies focused on the private sector and on technology transfer for attaining innovation, customer orientation and acquiring technological abilities. The university–industry relationship was also observed, in which the focus is on universities creating and transferring knowledge in order to foment the economic and technological power of industries. The findings can assist public and private companies, non-governmental organizations, university and industry applications in terms of knowledge management and technology transfer. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, academics should enhance entrepreneurial capacity to leverage digital-based advances and knowledge capital to support academic economic growth. A scoping review based on the Joanna Briggs Institute’s guiding principles, using Krueger’s intention-based entrepreneurship model as the theoretical framework, was undertaken to determine the extent of the literature related to characteristics, attributes, behaviours, enablers, and barriers of academic entrepreneurship in Higher Education Institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Twenty articles were identified and included. The most common academic entrepreneurial characteristics included hunger for success, desire for independence, innovation, creativity, futuristic thinking, and self-esteem. For entrepreneurship to flourish, donor support, strong regulatory systems, political and macroeconomic stability were necessary. Characteristics such as innovation, creativity and futuristic thinking were tied to academic entrepreneurship. Further research on enablers and barriers is suggested to guide academics in LMIC universities with their transition to entrepreneurship as their engagement with society develops. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Innovation is a fundamental driver for economy, and entrepreneurship is one main vehicle by which innovations can create value. Universities are one main component of the national innovation systems and entrepreneurship ecosystem. In that sense, universities, have a fundamental role in fostering innovation culture, producing required knowledge, nourishing talent, supporting startups to become entrepreneurial, and serving industry. The aim of this paper is to study how universities become entrepreneurial. The concept of entrepreneurial university was closely examined through literature review and study tours and interviews at four universities: TU Graz in Austria, University of Turku and Aalto University in Finland, and TU Berlin in Germany. The results produced highlighted the different entrepreneurial activities these universities perform and what it takes to become an entrepreneurial university. For a university to become entrepreneurial, it needs to acquire strategic commitment in terms of leadership buy-in, adjustment of organizational structure, culture and policies, and detailed planning. The university also needs to allocate or acquire the necessary financial, human, physical and digital resources. In addition, the university needs to deliver entrepreneurial awareness, education, and research. Moreover, the university also needs to support startups at their different stages through various services. Furthermore, the university must have a strong industry orientation in terms of being aware of industry needs, having a solid Intellectual Property's policy, technology commercialization infrastructure, and performing collaborative research with industry. Finally, the university needs to have a regular impact assessment and evaluation followed by an action plan for improvement. Copyright © 2021 by Naudé Scribante.

AB  - The geometry measurement of involute gears is a key step within modelling, manufacturing, and performance evaluation to assure the delivery of high performance and cost-effective gears and gearboxes. Current challenges in manufacturing metrology can be summarized in five keywords: fast, accurate, reliable, flexible, and holistic. Moreover, modern non-generative production methods such as five-axis milling may need different inspection strategies for reliable quality assurance. Standardized strategies refer to the most relevant 2D-sections, single helix, and profile line inspection, which has been state of the art for many decades. These methods are still relevant and continue to deliver high performance gears, but other options are becoming available. Modern coordinate metrology systems such as CMMs or GMMs gather holistic information about dimension and surface form of gears with high point density and accuracy in a short time. Currently, however, we do not know how to use this holistic information. This paper introduces a 3D evaluation strategy for cylindrical involute gears used at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. The focus is on describing the holistic evaluation of synthetic and measured data. Considering the complete gear surface in one common model allows us to a) determine deviations along the whole flank, b) obtain more relevant and stable geometrical fitting parameters, c) find correlations between gear fitting parameters and d) properly understand possible manufacturing errors. The paper also shows how Newcastle University's Design Unit used holistic evaluated data to investigate gear surface harmonic analysis methods. Harmonic analysis of 2D profile and helix measurement data is routinely used by some industries to control gear noise and characterize machine tool performance, but the evaluation of 3D surface measurement data has not been investigated. A review of some candidate methods using synthetic and measured data is presented and some of the challenges interpreting the results is discussed.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is becoming understood as a set of competencies needed for many professions and, as a result, requires to be integrated into higher education even in such seemingly distant areas as, e.g., public administration, sport, agriculture, tourism, etc. Therefore, there is a need for research-based guidance on how to introduce and develop entrepreneurial education as an enabling approach to the transition in higher education that could serve as an integral part of a paradigm shift towards an entrepreneurial university. This paper aims to support that transition and to address related challenges by the presentation of a new progression model, which provides guidelines for the development of courses at the tertiary level with an entrepreneurial university approach. The construction of the new applicable model is central to the purpose of this study and based on a systematized literature review. Additionally, the input–process–output–outcome framework, originally constructed for the evaluation of educational programs, was adapted to the incorporation of an overall framework into the new model. In the results, the paper redefines some of the relevant core terms, such as “entrepreneurial education” and its “progression model”. The research outcomes offer broad practical and theoretical applicability to a range of stakeholders— educators, students/learners, industry/business, policy makers, and researchers. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Spin-off are considered as the most important factors of technological innovations in the industry. Hence, in many industries, spin-off are used to realize technological developments. Space Industry is considered to have a very high level of spin-off potential due to its leading-edge nature, a large palette of involved industries and technologies in it, the basis of high-tech management skills, as well as the level of intellectualism in the labour force involved. Space spin-offs having higher productivity are the ones involved outside the space industry, especially in academic, government and commercial sector. According to the available literature, there are four types of spin-offs: Start-up, direct technology transfer,university spin-offs and corporate spin-offs. This paper analyses space spin-offs and their success rates comparing the mother company size and the spin-off type. The research is done in the form of a meta-analysis of the available literature about space spin-offs summarizing the success rates of space spin-offs to act as a guide for space companies aiming to start spin-off and help them decide the best spin-off option for their situation. © 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

AB  - This study presents a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications investigating entrepreneurial universities in the business and management fields. The authors collected 511 documents from the Web of Science and analysed them using Bibliometrix, an RStudio package for performance analysis and science mapping. The study aims to provide an overview of the evolution of research about this topic and describe the structures (i.e., conceptual, social, and intellectual) characterising it. It discusses the results to identify the main areas addressed so far and highlight gaps in the literature, offering avenues for possible future research. The results show that publications on entrepreneurial universities started over 30 years ago and show an increasing trend, more than tripling in the last 10 years. Considering authors and documents as a unit of analysis, the US and Europe perform well in terms of productivity and relevance, but the phenomenon is globally relevant. The contribution to socio-economic development, especially in developing countries, is a hot topic for future studies. Despite increasing production rates, research on this topic remains fragmented, justifying the need for more systematisation. Furthermore, the paper offers policy makers and practitioners a useful baseline for developing entrepreneurial universities and considering their technological, managerial, and organisational implications. © 2020

AB  - Many municipalities and local road authorities seek to implement automated evaluation of road damage. However, they often lack technology, know-how, and funds to afford state-of-the-art data collection equipment for collection and analysis of road deficiencies. The paper describes the development of a localized road damage detection model using the transfer learning method and assessment of its usability for training the detection model from a local road image dataset of a limited size. Localized road damage dataset is created by capturing 3,923 Czech and Slovak road images containing 5,072 instances of detected road damage using a smartphone installed on the vehicle's windshield. Then, a supervised neural network was trained using the road damage dataset labeled by experts. A pre-trained MobileNet model developed by the University of Tokyo and transfer learning method were employed to accelerate the training process and to improve the model's performance when a relatively small, localized dataset is used. Finally, the performance of the developed road damage detection model was analyzed. The results show that it is possible to capture road damage into preset classes with accuracy based on the F1-score ranging between 45% and 98%. Further improvement in the detection rate can be achieved by increasing the training dataset size. The developed road damage detection model is publicly available on https://github.com/amraz39/RoadDamage DetectorCZ and it shows the high potential of employing deep neural networks in the detection of road damage by local road agencies. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Digital technology always accelerates change, altering organisations culturally, socially and technically. These modifications are known as “digital transformation” (DT). On a much greater scale than DT, the world was changed in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, which re-organised society in the way of thinking, acting, producing, consuming and creating new business. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) were no different, since these institutions had to make changes to the student–lecturer interaction; teaching–learning, where DT had a relevant role, above all in academic entrepreneurship. Therefore, this study aims to propose a framework showing the structural pillars of the link between digital transformation (DT) and academic entrepreneurship (AC) (DT-AC Framework). This framework identifies the new patterns, methods, skills and other discoveries in aspects such as management, information systems and culture sciences. The intention is not to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic imposed global structural changes, but because of it, lecturers and students found their DT accelerated and intensified, and so it is necessary to investigate the pillars supporting academic entrepreneurship. The results show that DT was already emerging as a basic element of academic entrepreneurship before the pandemic, but the process has speeded up. This bibliometric study indicates the structural pillars that support entrepreneurship following the Covid19 pandemic, as created from DT in universities, providing an extensive systematic review that indicates the cause and effect of the academic entrepreneurship process. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue in favor of the open hardware philosophy (open-source hardware – OSH) as a technological innovation and academic entrepreneurshipmodel in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process. Findings: As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education. Research limitations/implications: There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models. Originality/value: The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature. © 2020, Vinícius Rosa Cota, Cleiton Lopes Aguiar, Bezamat de Souza Neto and Miguel Benegas.

AB  - The Booktower complex, the central library of Ghent University (1933–1947), is a celebrated masterpiece of modernist architect Henry van de Velde. In addition, the tower also counts as one of the first European towers in reinforced concrete, next to several other noteworthy structural and technical achievements. This paper revisits the process of designing and building the Booktower, evaluating the architect’s collaborations with engineers including Gustave Magnel and Jean-Norbert Cloquet but also the contributions of skilled contractors like Gillion and Van Pottelbergh, specialists in the use of reinforced concrete. This paper scrutinizes the collaborations in the design team by assessing contracts, plans, correspondence and other archival materials. The research develops a rich perspective on the respective roles of architects, engineers and contractors, demonstrating how their collaboration was largely conditioned by the university and how each came up with state-of-the art methods to meet the challenges of the project. © 2021 the Author(s).

AB  - This paper highlights the capacity for Institutional Theory [IT] to render in-depth understanding of change processes associated with the adoption and implementation of international accounting standards by countries and organisations. Although the fact of requiring the adoption of IFRS could be characterised as a form of coercive power, recent developments in IT help to explore the extent to which adoption and diffusion of IFRS is shaped by agency, the interests of actors involved in the adoption process, and the role of institutional entrepreneurs and institutional work. We provide a structured review of literature that uses an IT framework in the context of adopting and implementing IFRS. The review brings together various streams of IT and current debates in the management and organisation literature. This allows us to outline an agenda for future research that proposes six new research questions for investigation. These research questions are intended to encourage greater regard for the capacity of the theoretical toolkit of institutional logics to explore institutional entrepreneurship, institutional work, and the institutional dynamics of change processes associated with the adoption, maintenance and disruption of accounting systems. © 2020 Asociación Española de Contabilidad y Administración de Empresas (AECA).

AB  - Recent work on Region Innovation Systems (RIS) has emphasised the importance of universities. Until recently, however, related insights into the dynamics of this relationship in respect of the specific role of the science park have been limited. This paper presents a systematic review identifying the key roles of each actor in relation to innovation. We link the dynamic roles performed by the university between science parks and the RIS. Our results enable us to identify how the key activities performed by the university change during its interrelations within the RIS and with the science park. Our analysis of the literature distinguishes between three sets of relationships through which the university plays differing roles: RIS-university, RIS-university-science park, and university-science park. Respectively, the University’s relationships between these different RIS actors focuses on: resource sharing, brokerage, and commercialisation-exploitation. Secondly, we find that within each of these relationship types the university can perform three types of roles: on knowledge co-creation, acting as conduit, and inter-organisational relationship building. Distinguishing between these differing relationships and roles enables us to identify a total of nine dynamic roles performed by the University, which include: provision of information, channels of communication, infrastructure, regional networking, building research collaboration, acting as knowledge intermediaries, economic development, technological change and commercialisation processes, and start up creation and commercialisation. The review identifies several gaps in the literature in need of further research, and suggests that university relationships with RIS, interlinked with those between the university and science park itself, are important factors affecting science park innovation performance. © 2021, Crown.

AB  - Public-to-private technology transfer, featuring translational efforts from academia to market, does not achieve homogeneous results across the board. European universities and public research organisations (PROs) prove less performing than colleagues from the USA and this lag has been a major policy issue for European institutions in the last two decades, since R&D investments do not yield appropriate returns in terms of intellectual property, licenses and spin-out companies. Barriers to successful technology transfer are relevant and technology transfer offices (TTOs) as intermediaries in the technology market are underperforming. While studies have been conducted in technology management literature to identify barriers, so far there seems to be a lack of a holistic tool that help measure and improve TTO’s performance. In an effort to provide such tool, we use the CCODE® methodology and adapt it to TTOs. Based on an extensive literature review, we identify five factors that are generally considered determinants of the performance and develop what could be the basis for a diagnostic tool able to help single TTOs and their PROs identifying areas where changes could be made to improve their performance.

AB  - Solving grand societal challenges such as equitable healthcare provision and climate change will require institutional entrepreneurs - people who can challenge prevailing regulations, behaviors, and ways of thinking. As the pinnacle of educational achievement, the doctoral degree should be the fire in which such fledgling institutional entrepreneurs are forged. Doctoral education has, however, been criticized as overspecialized and divorced from reality. We systematically review the doctoral education literature in our search for doctoral education programs that challenge institutional norms by bridging sectoral and disciplinary divides. We ask whether such programs can help to nurture institutionally entrepreneurial researchers. We find that students must manage ambiguous identities and wide networks but that such programs have the potential to equip them for both sense-making and sensegiving activities of institutional entrepreneurship. © 2021.

AB  - This paper provides a review of the existing literature about the co-evolution of emerging economy multinational enterprises (EMNEs) and institutions and proposes directions for future study. We find that many existing studies involving the institution-EMNE relationship focus on the impact of institutions on EMNEs, and the research on their co-evolution is very limited in terms of emerging economies involved and theories and research methods applied. Given varieties of the institution-EMNE relationship we call for more studies by applying more contextualized theoretical perspectives and innovative and multiple research methods to advance our knowledge about the topic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Universities are widely perceived as a source of state-of-the-art scientific knowledge and firms opt to work with them to advance their competitive advantages in innovation development. However, collaborations often meet unproductive performance and unsmooth interactions due to gaps in research capability, goals, and working protocols. To reduce the risks of deterioration in collaboration, executives need to foresee possible gaps in advance so that relevant solutions can be planned. This paper introduces the 3-phase analytical approach to manage the university-industry collaboration (UIC). The first phase involves assessing the matching quality of university partners. Next, the assessment result is diagnosed to detect the matching quality gaps. Then, the third phase applies the assessment results to 1.) position university partners into the proper mode of collaboration; Orchestrated collaboration, Assistive collaboration, Attentive collaboration and Mismatched collaboration, according to their complementarities and compatibilities and 2.) craft a strategic roadmap guiding the relationship development toward effective UIC with selected partners. This 3-phase approach helps managers realize possible difficulties and systematically prepare solutions in advance. © 2022 PICMET.

AB  - Using technical measures is almost unavoidable in large-scale complex engineered systems design. Technical measures play a critical role in design and management, where the set of technical measures is relied upon as an indicator of the project state for decision making, risk assessment, evaluation, and forecasting. Given the criticality of technical measures, it is important to know how to choose the “right” measures. This research answers the question: what guidance is published on how to select technical measures for the design of large-scale complex engineered systems in academic literature? A systematic review is performed, identifying relevant sources through a formalized process that includes all sources that satisfy predetermined inclusion criteria, rather than including sources that support a desired finding, resulting in evidence-based data to understand the current guidance for technical measures selection. One hundred ninety-eight guidance statements for selection for technical measures for the design of large-scale complex engineered systems are identified from the systematic review and analyzed via content analysis. It is identified that the current guidance for the selection of technical measures is high level, most often focusing on qualities that the measures should exhibit and identifying from where the measures are derived. Specific, practical guidance is lacking, leaving the selection of a critical piece of systems design largely up to the best judgment and experience of the systems engineer. The contribution of this research is an overview of published guidance for the selection of technical measures and identification of gaps in guidance that future research can address.

AB  - The importance and the definition of an entrepreneurial university (EU), together with the factors that lead to its existence, have been widely discussed in the literature. Moreover, in recent years, the EU has also been the target of some public policies. This study aims to identify the different theoretical approaches to entrepreneurial universities prevalent in the literature. Using information from the Web of Science database, we performed a co-citation bibliometric analysis, which made it possible to identify six distinct EU approaches: the triple helix model, the knowledge society model, the global perspective, the researcher-entrepreneur model, the dual personality approach, and also a frenzied approach. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: The lab report is a commonly assigned genre in engineering lab courses; however, students often have difficulties meeting the expectations of writing in engineering labs. At the same time, it is challenging for engineering faculty to instruct lab report writing because they are often under-supported in writing pedagogies and usually unfamiliar with the extent of students' prior writing knowledge. Literature review: Literature on technical communication in engineering addresses the importance of a rhetorical approach to writing instruction, as well as an emphasis on genre. Extending this literature, research into writing transfer provides valuable insight for better understanding how undergraduates negotiate the engineering lab report as a new genre within this distinct rhetorical context. Research questions: 1. How effective is a transfer-focused writing pedagogy in supporting students' understanding of the genre conventions of engineering lab reports? 2. How does the transfer-focused writing pedagogy impact students' writing quality in five categories (rhetorical knowledge, organization, evidence, critical thinking, and disciplinary conventions)? 3. What are the rhetorical features that engineering students improve or struggle with the most with lab report writing? Research methodology: Four engineering instructors and two English instructors participated in this study to design and develop the lab report writing instructional module, and implemented the module materials into their engineering lab courses. The module, consisting of lab report writing instruction and assessment resources, shares a rhetorical approach and foundational writing terms with first-year composition courses to emphasize a writing-transfer pedagogy. We collected and analyzed undergraduates' lab report samples to evaluate the impact of the module on students' writing performance. Two sets of lab reports were collected for analysis: the sample sets before (control), during the 2015-2016 academic year; and after (experimental) implementation of the module, during the 2016-2017 academic year. Results and conclusions: Data collected via pre- and post-implementation writing artifacts show that a rhetorical approach to teaching lab reports helped students better understand the expectations of the lab report as a discipline-specific genre, and it developed students' understanding of the rhetorical features of engineering writing. The pilot module positively impacted the quality of students' lab reports, a finding that suggests that using a transfer-focused writing pedagogy can successfully support the transfer and adaptation of writing knowledge into gateway or entry-level engineering laboratory courses. © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Technology transfer offices (TTOs) play an important role in innovation ecosystems. There is a global strive to make these offices more efficient and improve their performance. This study aims to reason the key factors influencing the performance of TTOs at the members of the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU). To reach this aim, the comparative literature review of the factors influencing the performance of the TTOs was performed first. The survey along with the semi-structured interviews interviewing leaders of the TTOs with the aim to validate the relevance of the factors was conducted afterwards. The discussion on the key factors influencing the performance of TTOs at ECIU members is presented at the end of the study. The study reveals the following as the key factors influencing the performance of TTOs at the ECIU network: i) TTO strategy; ii) relationships with investors; iii) networking; iv) functioning of a special TTO unit dedicated to working with industry; and v) business experience of TTO staff. It also brings an extension to the technology transfer literature by discussing organizational issues of technology transfer in the European context. The study reveals that the key factors influencing the performance of TTOs at ECIU members are quite similar regardless of the age of TTOs or the country of operation. © 2021, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

AB  - The paper explores the introduction of glued laminated timber technology to the Norwegian construction market in the late 1950s. The paper concentrates on the activities of Norwegian construction conglomerate Moelven Brug, which in the 1950s brought back the production of laminated timber in Norway after 40 years of absence in the country. Building on the work of Norwegian glulam pioneer Guttorm Brekke (1885– 1980) and on state-of-the-art academic research and industry know-how from the United States of America, Sweden, and Belgium, in the post-war period Moelven Brug quickly established itself as the market leader for laminated timber in Norway. By mapping these scholarly and professional exchanges, the paper traces the shifting ontological understanding of timber in Norway from a “natural” to a “scientific” material and its transformation into a complex assemblage of different substances subject to control and standardization through a series of variables and parametric values. © 2021 the Author(s).

AB  - Despite the growing interest of sustainability transition studies on the role of business actors in shaping transitions, the institutionalized logic of the capitalist enterprise underlying such agency has been overlooked. However, such logic might be understood as a dominant regime that leads to unsustainable systems. We intend to contribute to transitions research by focusing on the agency of social enterprises as non-dominant actors searching for challenging and transforming the institutionalized logics in the business system. Therefore, we disentangle the institutional mechanisms driven by social enterprises by proposing a theoretical model built upon a literature review of sustainability transitions from institutional perspectives, offering a set of explanatory propositions to allow empirical examination. Those mechanisms and propositions operate at three levels: inside the individual, inside the niche, and at the interplay between the niche and the business regime. Finally, we include a real-world example of a social enterprise to illustrate the model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research and technology commercialization at research-intensive universities has helped to develop provincial economies resulting in university startups, the growth of other new companies and associated employment. University technology transfer offices (TTOs) oversee the process of technology transfer into the commercial marketplace and these organizational units can be considered in the context of enabling effective knowledge management. However, what enables productive TTO performance has not been comprehensively researched. Therefore, this research study adopted the knowledge-based view as the theoretical construct to support a comprehensive investigation into this area. This was achieved through employing a systematic literature review (SLR) combined with a robust meta-analysis. The SLR identified an initial total of 10,126 articles in the first step of the review process, with 44 studies included in the quantitative synthesis, and 29 quantitative empirical studies selected for the meta-analysis. The research study identified that the relationship between TTO knowledge management and knowledge deployment as well as startup business performance is where TTOs secure the strongest returns. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Australia is a world leader in the development and application of Remote Operations technology at an industrial scale. The Australian Remote Operations for Space and Earth consortium (AROSE) undertook an in-depth national review of advanced technology, capabilities and processes in the field of Remote Operations. The study included applications across many industry sectors including Agriculture, Defence, Health Services, Manufacturing, Resources (Mining and Energy), and Space. The aim of this multilateral capability study was to support the growing Australian Space industry to solve common Space exploration challenges utilising Australia's world leading Remote Operations. This paper provides an independent capability baseline to catalyse cross industry growth in Remote Operations. The report outcomes will facilitate technology transfer and collaboration between traditional sectors and the burgeoning Australian Space industry. This paper was developed in collaboration with leading industry and academic experts in Agriculture, Defence, Health Services, Resources (Mining and Energy), and Space industries, who either utilise or supply Remote Operations capabilities and/or enabling technologies. Our methods included, but are not limited to, stakeholder interviews, consultation with subject matter experts, literature reviews, and the aggregation of public data. It was clear from this capability study that end-to-end Remote Operations in Australia is world-leading and cuts heavily across multiple major sectors to improve safety, reliability, productivity, and sustainability. Fundamentally, the same challenges faced by many of the sectors, particularly Mining and Energy, are mirrored by the Space industry for missions focused on foundational and construction services, exploration and excavation, and In-Situ-Resource-Utilisation (ISRU). Solving these cross-sector challenges through multi-lateral collaborations will enable a broader impact on complementary industrial sectors and Australia's Space industry. This Remote Operations capability study significantly improved the understanding of current capability in Australia and the spin-in/spin-out opportunity for Space operations. The report identifies the benefits and emerging challenges for industry in the field of Remote Operations and identifies the opportunities for, and from, collaborative Space exploration activities.

AB  - This article provides a critical overview of the development process of entrepreneurial ecosystems and the role played by technology and startups within such process. The analysis focus on the characteristics and components of entrepreneurial ecosystems with special attention to startups, as they are the main actors of these ecosystems. The objectives are reached through a critical literature review. Results show the evolution of these ecosystems, and an in-deep analysis of the role played by startups, big companies and governments in such evolution. The knowledge paradox between universities and startups is also taken into account together with and the importance of cities in the development of successful entrepreneurial ecosystems. We apply the result of our critical review to the analysis of the case of the Barcelona Ecosystem. Last section is devoted to policy implications for the strengthening of entrepreneurial ecosystems with special reference to the universities and the need for a redesign of technology transfer strategies. Success factors analysis and specific policy recommendations can help to a better understanding and policy planning of entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2020, Universitat de Barcelona, Facultad de Economia y Empresa.

AB  - The article analyzes the relationship between the concepts “quality of scientific activity”, “technology transfer” and “research integrity”. The main task of research is to offer practical tools for maintaining research integrity as elements of the internal and external quality assurance system of education and research. One of the working hypotheses of the study is the correlation between the quality of educational activities at the university, the quality of research and the level of interest of customers of innovative developments in the process of transfer and commercialization of research results. The first two components are determined by the “purity” of research through the implementation of the principles of research integrity. The schematic relationship between the individual goals of sustainable development characterizes the relationship “university − the quality of research − technology transfer – industry”. A logical scheme between research integrity, technology transfer and procedures for internal and external research quality assurance is proposed. The abstract-logical method and the method of induction-deduction were used to analyze the relationship between the concepts of “quality of scientific activity”, “technology transfer” and “research integrity”. Bibliometric analysis was performed using SciVal and VOSviewer tools based on data from the scientific-metric databases Scopus and Web of Science. Based on the bibliometric analysis, it was found that the query “research integrity” identifies the main violations of research integrity and shows a strong link between the quality of research and success in the transfer of knowledge and technology from university to industry. The main problems of the development of technology transfer between the university and industry at the national level are analyzed. A separate block of problems related to research integrity is identified. The case of the national university on creation of university system of maintenance of research integrity and development of infrastructure of maintenance of scientific activity within the limits of the specified system is resulted. The results of the work can be useful for the triangle “business education-science” to reconcile the interests of all the “vertices” of the triangle under the mandatory condition-ensuring the quality of educational and research activities in universities as centers of intellectual potential. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - The literature on university–industry relations suggests the need for greater clarification and deeper systematization of the University–Industry cooperation process. This study aims, using a systematic review of the literature to deepen the University–Industry state of the art and identify the main research trends. ISI's Web of Science was the database used, and a Bibliographic Coupling bibliometric analysis was performed. Based on the outcomes of the literature review, we could identify four clusters: (1) motivations and barriers to cooperation, (2) determinant factors, (3) government measures, and (4) Intersector technological cooperation. This article reveals that industries are willing and motivated to engage in cooperation agreements with universities due to knowledge and technology transfer, however, some barriers will have to be overcome. Based on the existing literature, an agenda for further research was laid out. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Collaboration Platforms are virtual or physical places that serve as an intermediary or medium for the exchange of technology, knowledge, products or services between previously independent actors or institutions. In academia, they can facilitate the collaboration between universities. One increasingly important area of collaboration is knowledge management and transfer. In this paper, a literature review is applied in order to derive the state of the art of university platforms for knowledge management. Based on this, the purpose of such platforms is analysed. The results indicate that knowledge transfer focuses on teaching, research, and transfer activities. Often, e-learning platforms are used to facilitate cross-university transfer of knowledge. The motivation to use such platforms is to share knowledge, to make use of synergies in cooperation and to gain more visibility. It is also shown in this paper, that despite its common application, there is a gap in scientifically evaluating the effective contribution of such platforms as enabler for knowledge management.

AB  - Several authors have highlighted the growing number of publications on entrepreneurial universities and have drawn academia's attention to the need for more studies focusing on entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of universities as it is an area that is still under-explored. The entrepreneurial university concept tends to be diverse and ambiguous in the literature, attracting several researchers' attention. In this sense, EO should also be increasingly integrated into the university's role. Thus, this study sought to contribute to state-of-the-art development about university EO using a systematic literature review. The aim is to analyze the literature on university EO to identify key trends in the literature, gaps in the literature and define a research agenda. The results identified three major dimensions around EO in universities: i) entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial universities, ii) entrepreneurial orientation and academic spin-offs, and iii) entrepreneurial orientation and academic entrepreneurship. © 2021, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

AB  - The objective of the paper is to diagnose organisational culture of selected universities and analyse its impact on the innovation processes within them. The subject matter of the study was organisational culture and innovation at universities. The subjects were four selected universities in Poland, Austria, Germany, and Ukraine. The paper provided a definition of organisational culture and its typology. It further discussed the organisational culture of universities and the relationships between organisational culture and innovativeness. The literature review provided foundations for building a model for the formation of a type of organisational culture at universities that is innovation-friendly, which is the added value of the paper. It offers actions worth taking to shape innovation-friendly culture at universities. It is particularly important during difficult time of changing labour market, when universities greatly impact the attitudes of young people. The knowledge of how to shape innovation-friendly organisational culture at universities is necessary for academia to profile future employees in times of continuous changes. To investigate the relationship between organisational culture and the innovativeness of universities, we designed an original survey questionnaire [S1 File]. Organisational culture was diagnosed with the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument by K.S. Cameron and R.E. Quinn. The analyses were conducted in Dell Statistica v. 13.1 (StatSoft Polska). We normalised data from the Likert rating scale using Kaufman’s and Rousseeuw’s formula. We used Spearman’s correlation coefficient and Kendall’s W to calculate correlations. The research shows that the investigated Polish and Austrian universities are dominated by hierarchy and market cultures. On the other hand, the German and Ukrainian universities host all cultures, but clan and adhocracy dominate there. Moreover, the analyses demonstrated that although the adhocracy culture was the least visible in the investigated organisations, it contributes to university innovativeness the most. The conclusions were used to build a model for promoting innovation-friendly organisational culture at universities. The model contains answers to the research questions. In addition, it offers guidelines for shaping organisational culture to bolster innovation at universities. The research identified relationships between organisational culture and university innovativeness and components that create innovation opportunities at universities as its contribution to management theory. When applied in practice, the guidelines can help form the university’s organisational culture bottom-up. Copyright: © 2021 Gorzelany et al.

AB  - Higher education institutions (HEIs) are experiencing a challenging era due to demand–response imbalances. An assumed means of responding to the challenge is through the entrepreneurial university model, which adds a third mission to HEIs: to contribute to economic, technological and social development. Therefore, governments across the globe promote this ideal through system reforms and funding schemes, while HEIs ignite institutional changes. Publications also explore the entrepreneurial university model, although some scholars have criticized the new mission and its implied commercial orientation. However, little is still known about how HEIs are applying the model to become more entrepreneurial. Therefore, this article presents a systematic literature review comprised of a meta-ethnography on the transformation journey of 36 HEIs across 18 countries. The outcome is a four-stage iterative action-framework proposition, suggesting that exogenous and endogenous forces constantly influence HEIs which, in response, ignite experiments, requiring sensitization to be consolidated and later institutionalized, in an endless, long and rather slow process. This article contributes to theory by explaining the metalevel of HEIs’ entrepreneurial pathway process and to practice by providing policymakers and decision makers in HEIs with an analytical framework. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The licensing of technologies of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Institutions (STIs) is recognized as a traditional and established vehicle for bringing the knowledge produced in universities and research centres to consumers, using companies from the production environment as intermediaries. To better understand the factors related to efficiency in the licensing process for STI technologies for companies, a search for studies that addressed the subject was carried out, using the method of systematic literature review (SLR). The review presents the aspects indicated by the authors as responsible for the efficiency in the process. The results were used to answer descriptive questions, such as in which situation and how the licensing occurred and which aspects impacted on the commercial success of the product arising from the technology. Also, the results were used to answer prescriptive efficiency questions, such as when and how licensing should occur and what should be done to influence the success of economic exploration. The structuring of questions and answers, together with the review, contribute to present the state of the art of the literature on procedures related to efficiency in technology licensing. © IEOM Society International.

AB  - The active contribution of academic institutions to the technological, social and economic development of societies is of increasing importance. To better understand this contribution, we present a systematic review, together with bibliometric and network analyses of the academic entrepreneurship literature. This provides a map of the main topics approached by scholars, thereby illustrating the scientific scenario of the field. Our findings identify three highly interconnected research activity domains that characterize the multidimensional features of entrepreneurship in the academic setting, as well as a significant gap in the literature regarding studies evaluating approaches to support the navigation of potential scientific discoveries to the market. We organize our findings into a four stages framework consisting of: idea inception; the recognition of how this idea unlocks value for customers and other stakeholders; development of an innovative business model; and a commercialization strategy that creates real impact. We discuss the relevance of each stage for the establishment of a more innovation-friendly environment and conclude by offering perspectives into future research opportunities and by encouraging studies that consider the academic entrepreneurship process from a systemic perspective, to support a greater contribution of academic institutions to the economic and social development of the nations and societies. © 2021

AB  - The industrial revolution especially in the IR4.0 era have driven many states of the art technologies to be introduced. The automotive industry as well as many other key industries have also been greatly influenced. The rapid development of automotive industries in Europe have created wide industry gap between European Union (EU) and developing countries such as in South East Asia (SEA). Indulging this situation, FH JOANNEUM, Austria together with European partners from FH Aachen, Germany and Politecnico di Torino, Italy are taking initiative to close down the gap utilizing the Erasmus+ United Capacity Building in Higher Education grant from EU. A consortium was founded to engage with automotive technology transfer using the European framework to Malaysian, Indonesian and Thailand Higher Education Institutions (HEI) as well as automotive industries in respective countries. This could be achieved by establishing Engineering Knowledge Transfer Unit (EKTU) in respective SEA institutions guided by the industry partners in their respective countries. This EKTU could offer updated, innovative and high-quality training courses to increase graduate’s employability in higher education institutions and strengthen relations between HEI and the wider economic and social environment by addressing University-industry cooperation which is the regional priority for Asia. It is expected that, the Capacity Building Initiative would improve the quality of higher education and enhancing its relevance for the labor market and society in the SEA partners. The outcome of this project would greatly benefit the partners in strong and complementary partnership targeting the automotive industry and enhanced larger scale international cooperation between the European and SEA partners. It would also prepare the SEA HEI in sustainable partnership with Automotive industry in the region as a mean of income generation in the future. © IEOM Society International.

AB  - Academic entrepreneurship currently features as a leading topic in the field of entrepreneurship. This research study aims to carry out bibliometric analysis on this topic through recourse to cluster analysis. We carried out extensive search (1971–2017) of the Web of Science database that identified seven clusters in the literature: entrepreneurial universities, university–industry interactions, university–industry knowledge transfers, university–industry innovation networks, university entrepreneurship, university–industry industrial property and innovation ecosystems. This study reinforces the coherence and scientific structure of the existing literature and serves as a starting point for other studies on this field. We close with debate about the future research agenda for academic entrepreneurship. © 2018, International Association of Universities.

AB  - In knowledge economy era, enterprise needs to innovate to maintain its advantages and competitiveness. Construction enterprises, being pillars of China’s economy and confronting the challenge brought by the strategy of “going out”, the call for their technology or management innovation was broadly pronounced across practical and academic fields. Social capital (SC), as a resource in a social network, is the basis for creating sustainable competitiveness and advantage for enterprises. The innovative achievements and innovation performance (IP) of enterprises are largely determined by their SC. To achieve competitiveness in the market, enterprises must carry out knowledge transfer (KT) with the other members of their networks. However, few scholars have examined weather SC has any effect on IP in construction enterprises. Using a KT perspective, this paper explored how SC affects the IP of construction enterprises. Based on the literature review and analysis, a conceptual model was constructed and validated using structural equation modeling (SEM). Through empirical analysis, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) SC has a positive impact on the IP of construction enterprises. Among them, the structural dimension (SD) and cognitive dimension (CD) have a significant positive impact on the IP of construction enterprises, while the relational dimension (RD) does not. (2) The SD, CD, and RD of construction enterprises’ SC have a positive influence on KT. (3) There are mediating effects of KT between SC and IP of construction firms, and they are partial. KT plays a partial mediating effect between SD, CD, and IP of construction firms. The research results can not only improve an understanding of effects of SC on IP of construction enterprises, but also validate the importance of KT in stimulating IP. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Over the years, the literature on management has advanced in the understanding of the relationship between technology transfer, absorptive capacity and organisational performance. Nevertheless, to date, the number of studies investigating these relationships in a joint manner, showing how the result varies in different contexts, is still rare. This systematic literature review analyses the existing academic literature on the relationship between technology transfer, absorptive capacity and organisational performance by carrying out a bibliometric and qualitative analysis of the literature. The bibliometric analysis provided an overview of the literature, identifying the most prominent and influent journals, countries, institutions, authors and research methods, as well as intersections between the constructs and the temporal evolution of the publications. The qualitative analysis was employed in order to understand, systematise and assess the previous findings on the subjects. The results showed that absorptive capacity is an important factor for effective technology transfer, when taking into account international technology transfer, university-industry collaboration and inter-organisational transfer. The literature converges in indicating that both technology transfer and absorptive capacity have a positive impact on organisational performance, although some existing exceptions need to be considered. Finally, the study provides an agenda for future research based on contextual, methodological and theoretical gaps identified.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

AB  - It is now increasingly acknowledged that universities, despite their research capabilities and ownership of the new technical information they generate, are able to transform only a small minority of the patents they hold into innovations. In the transition from research outcome to innovation, information about the entrepreneurial opportunity is important because the outcomes of academic research are distant from the marketplace: as they have not been conceived with consideration of practical use but solely in a quest for understanding a scientific phenomenon. This underpins the rationale for our study into the information conditions regarding the entrepreneurial opportunity in the context of the prevailing property rights regime. In addressing this issue we adopt a theory-led realist synthesis approach to the conduct of a systematic literature review. Whilst we find empirical evidence supporting the conclusions of theoretical models, i.e. the strengthening role of technology transfer offices, we also point to their shortcomings. We go on to argue that significant gaps in our knowledge, and thus our ability to act, remain. In response, we advance an agenda for future research that focuses on the exploration of alternative policy actions (interventions) that draw from different paradigmatic lenses and methodological approaches. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Improving and adapting strategies to teach Software Engineering (SE) insights is one of the primary goals of SE schools. Every year, we come up with plenty of studies that provide suggestions and guidelines on improving teaching methods, problem-solving strategies, and curriculum design. On the other hand, we do not know how the world's top-notch universities focus on the process and academic improvement. This study shares our experience while investigating the Tsinghua University (QS World ranked 17)1, School of Software process and providing an initial guideline for further improvement. In this study, we, first, aim to gather suggestions and guidelines given in the literature. Secondly, we observe and analyze the feedback given by external reviewers and, as an example, map those feedback-augmented findings and suggestions onto school processes. Lastly, we suggest how the software school can further enhance the teaching strategies, curriculum design, and problem solving skills.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This study addresses the diversity of extant models and theoretical interpretations of the immigrant entrepreneurship phenomenon. Combining an extensive literature review with the use of Bourdieu's theory of social practice, we develop a general model of immigrant entrepreneurship that identifies four different entrepreneurial paths, each characterised by a specific combination of personal resources, network embeddedness, individual habitus, and targeted opportunities. Through the interpretative lens of this model, foreignness can represent either a liability or a competitive advantage for the immigrant, depending on the entrepreneurial context and strategy. The proposed model provides useful insights into the phenomenon of immigrant entrepreneurship for academics, entrepreneurs and policy makers, offering a comprehensive framework which does not invalidate the extant models, but rather integrates them into a larger perspective. © 2020 European Academy of Management

AB  - The technologically sound students of today are open and very much inclined to adopt new modes of knowledge transfer inclusive of online classes. However, there are various viewpoints related to the aspect of online classes as not much of comparative studies on real classes and online classes have been carried out in Bahrain. Therefore, the need for a research study to find out the merits and demerits of real classes and online classes was identified. The objective of the study was to find out the reasons behind the preference of a class of HRM students of Gulf University, Kingdom of Bahrain with respect to the mode of its imparting – whether it is the real classes or online classes. A class of a HRM course was taken as a sample with the same faculty handling real classes before the midterm exam and online classes after midterm exam so that analysis could be carried out on the responses of the same set of students exposed to both the modes of teaching imparted by the same teacher. With an exhaustive literature review to trace the emergence of online classes and the impact of the same on the current generation, the study recorded the students’ responses in the form of a survey questionnaire. The quantitative analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and the variables were tested for the significance of the relationship using the Pearson Chi-Square test. The findings implicitly confirm that the students are comfortable with both real classes and online classes as far as the instructor is efficient to use appropriate pedagogies and digital tools to support learning. © 2020.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing pressure on Universities to shift from focusing primarily on teaching and performing research, and to add an equivocal Third Mission (TM), labelled “a contribution to society”. Unprecedented challenges have been redesigning the missions of Universities, which are often perceived as being at a crossroads. The TM is a multidisciplinary, complex, evolving phenomenon linked to the social and economic mission of Universities in a broad sense. Existing studies mainly focus on Universities in accomplishing their traditional missions, or they offer a narrow perspective of the TM. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic literature review has been performed on the TM to comprehensively explore its heterogeneous functions, constraints, clashes and incorporation within education and research. This paper presents a systematic review of the state of knowledge and develops a novel framework for the enactment of the TM. The paper reveals the potential and the constraints of the recurring themes of the TM, focusing especially on the engagement of non-academic stakeholders. It also suggests, to scholars and policymakers, a selection of measures through which some of the challenges might be faced. The paper offers both a descriptive and a thematic analysis, through examination of 134 peer-reviewed articles which were published between 2004 and May 2019. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The Moscow International University Ranking (MosIUR) is a global university ranking launched in 2017 with the intention of evaluating universities by considering three essential dimensions (education, research, and knowledge transfer). This ranking was designed and developed by the Russian Union of Rectors following a direct request from President Vladimir Putin. The objective of this work is to perform a threefold analysis of this ranking. First, a methodological analysis is carried out, focused on describing the nature of the indicators and sources employed. Second, a geopolitical analysis aims to determine how countries are represented in this new global ranking. Third, a webometric analysis is done, focused on the online visibility of the ranking. The results reveal MosIUR to be a ranking with an outstanding number of webometric indicators and clearly oriented towards transference to society. However, some methodological concerns arise regarding a few metrics. The geopolitical position of developed countries is similar to that in other global rankings, but slight differences emerge, such as the stronger presence of Russian universities. The cybermetric analysis confirms that, despite being international, this ranking is strongly limited to Russia. It can be concluded that, except for the palpable predominance of the USA, each ranking tends to place universities from their own country in a better position. The creation of MosIUR by the Russian government can thus be perceived as a political strategy to improve the reputation of Russian universities, increase funding, and accelerate their transformation into world-class universities. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse the “Third Mission” (TM) of universities within Nordic countries and universitieś approach to implementing the mission into their strategy. The main activities that Nordic universities relate to the Third Mission are examined and policy implications drawn. Furthermore, gaps in literature are outlined that imply possible future research. The systematic literature review outlines 35 articles in the period from 2000 to 2018. Qualitative case studies have been the main research method so far, and about half of the research at Nordic universities has been conducted in Sweden. Most research has focused on commercial aspects of the Third Mission, but neglected social components and indirect, less visible activities such as popular-science publications or participation in policymaking. Little research regarding TM has been conducted in humanities or social sciences. For future research, more cross-national studies are needed, as well as research with a mixed-method research design. © 2020 Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to identify the main strategies through which the university can positively contribute to the development of local and regional entrepreneurship throughout implementing its third mission (TM). In this paper, we approach the third mission (TM) of the university in the sense of its contribution regarding the knowledge transfers towards the community and society. We set out to achieve this general goal by discovering those key elements of academic leadership, related to the third mission, that can exert an influence on the entrepreneurial potential of the university towards regional community (starting from students, alumni, teachers, SMEs, society as a whole). The need for this research comes from the reality that universities are being pushed by educational, social and economic challenges to increasingly strengthen the link between theory and practice even through entrepreneurship. Having the role of trainers for future generations, universities have the chance but also the responsibility not only to encourage young people to embrace entrepreneurship but also to prepare them well. The applied research method is a bibliometric literature analysis and a network analysis by using VOSviewer, a specialized software. This research method enables the visualization of previous research patterns thus the conceptual clusters retrieved from the papers analyzed provide the grounded arguments for our research. In order to extract the necessary information for the purpose of the research, we performed the bibliometric analysis in Scopus database in the period 2015-2020, in order to identify and analyze the current perspectives on the subject presented by other authors. We applied this type of bibliometric literature analysis because it facilitates us to highlight several research directions, namely: which are the most discussed issues related to academic leadership and entrepreneurship, which are the shortcomings in discussions on this topic, which are the connections with practical research or which are the emergent issues on the topic. Based on the results, we reached our own conclusions and proposals regarding the academic leadership in the direction of entrepreneurship. In essence, we believe that the university, throughout its third mission (TM), has the potential to be a powerful engine for entrepreneurship development and we will argue the main approaches identified in this direction. The bibliometric analysis also revealed the gradual evolution of concepts in the analyzed period of time and various connections between the concepts discussed in Scopus database articles. A novel concept approached recently is the ‘entrepreneurial ecosystem’ which is being connected to the entrepreneurial agenda of universities. The links to this cluster showed that on a long-term strategy, entrepreneurial ecosystems will contribute to advanced entrepreneurial learning and business development especially in emergent economies. © 2021 Proceedings of the 17th European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2021.

AB  - The Bologna Process (BP) was used as an instrument to construct a European Higher Education Area that would be competitive in the world and to attract foreign students and academics to Europe. For a country such as Australia, this higher education innovation process constituted a possible challenge, especially since Australian HE is a marketized system relying on the influx of overseas students. The BP was, therefore, topic of a discussion spurred on by the Australian government. In this article, the results are presented of a literature review of Australian scholarly papers addressing the discussion on the BP in Australia. An overview is given of the scholars and their publications, of the reasons why they studied the BP, and of their stance regarding the BP. Neo-institutional theory is used to explain the findings. © 2020 HERDSA.

AB  - Purpose of this paper: This paper examines the past and present of the university spin-off (USO) phenomenon by identifying research findings and synthesizing different spin-off practices from around the globe. The evolution and future of this phenomenon are then discussed, alongside potential new lines of research. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a systematic literature review approach, combined with a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. This approach allows for the creation of a robust and reliable synthesis of the research carried out over the past 35 years (1986–2020), offering a fine-grained depiction of the USOs’ underlying relationships through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Findings: This paper contributes to scholarly literature on academic entrepreneurship by providing insights into the analytical trends of the past, current evidence on the configuration of USOs, and discussions of the future of USO research. Several implications for improving performance, productivity, and reinforcing capabilities emerge to assist spin-off CEOs, university managers, and policymakers. Originality/Contribution: This paper fulfils an identified need by revealing the trajectory of the USO research field. Additionally, it presents an up-to-date reflection of USO antecedents, decisions, and outcomes, outlining an agenda for future research. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.

AB  - The literature on academic entrepreneurship within business schools is limited and fragmented. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to address this deficit and to identify what business schools do to support academic entrepreneurship and to outline a future research agenda. Based on our systematic literature review we identified three main themes that business schools do to support academic entrepreneurship namely: entrepreneurial education; entrepreneurial networks; and entrepreneurial ecosystems. Furthermore, we identified two further embryonic themes, individual level factors and obstacles to entrepreneurship. Based on our review and analysis we present some future avenues for research. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study explores academic research on technology transfer (TT) and the related themes. The TT field has attracted considerable scholarly attention in recent years and has grown rapidly, resulting in a large body of knowledge. Using a bibliometric approach, this study reviews related research issues as well as their influence and connections and provides directions for future research. It uses Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science database that includes 3218 bibliographic references. Several bibliometric analysis techniques and a subsequent review of the content of the most relevant documents are adopted. The performance analysis provided an updated overview of the evolution of the TT literature from 1969 to 2018 and quantitatively identified the most active and influential journals, articles, authors, and organizations. The co-authorship network analysis allowed us to identify and visualize the structure of relations between authors as well as determine the collaboration patterns among them. On the basis of the information supplied by the co-authorship network, the main literature was reviewed to identify the current status and research trends related to TT, identifying five main research streams and related topics. The implications of the study’s findings and directions for future TT research are finally discussed to enhance our understanding of TT agents and issues and support further research in this field. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Summary: The tension between indigenizing versus internationalizing social work knowledge, resulting from local-specific sensitivity, has been a contemporary dispute in the Global South where there are diverse geo-historical backgrounds. This is the case in China, where the mainstream international narrative surrounding social work development has been configured by the normative values and knowledge of a Euromodern origin. Such misrepresentation rarely reflects indigenous voices from the local social work academy. Informed by Foucault’s thesis of power/knowledge, this article first compares the model of state social work in China and the world. Then, as a decolonizing project, a narrative review of 26 Chinese language articles was conducted. Findings: Distinctive service and policy practices in the Chinese traditional helping system were identified to illustrate how western social work was ethnocentrically repositioned in the “post-socialist” China. These initiatives include micro-level “Civil Affairs” services, meso-level “mass work” practice, and macro-level “Minsheng” State and crossregional Pairing Aid Programs, which are rooted in the cultural (Confucianism), economical (socialist market economy), and political (Marxism) ecosystem in China. Applications: Through an indigenized epistemological stance, a state-led anti-colonial framework is presented to unveil the making of social work indigenization and social welfare development that de-centers Eurocentric hegemony. To reorient social work knowledge apart from persistent neo-colonialism in the form of academic imperialism, social work development should be tailored into a locally responsive and geopolitically appropriate models in the non-western world. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to identify institutional work mechanisms that public actors employ in market shaping. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an abductive theorizing process, combining a literature review with an empirical exploration of three different market-shaping contexts. Findings: The study identifies 20 granular mechanisms of institutional work that market-shaping public actors employ. These mechanisms are all potentially employable in creating, maintaining or disrupting markets. Institutional work vis-à-vis individual institutions may differ in direction from the institutional work vis-à-vis the market system. Public actors are not a homogeneous group but may have different values and support competing institutional logics even when operating in the same market. Research limitations/implications: The empirical data were limited to three cases in three small open economies. Data collected from other markets and with other methods would provide more rigorous insight into market-shaping public actors. Practical implications: The findings revealed institutional work mechanisms that public actors can use to shape markets. Companies wanting to engage public actors in market shaping should be aware of the values and institutional logics that influence market-shaping public actors. Originality/value: The paper unites and expands on the scattered knowledge regarding institutional work in market shaping. It illuminates and dissects the role of public actors in market shaping, challenging the reactive stance that is often assigned to them. The study provides a better understanding of how conflicting market views affect markets. It also brings insights into the interplay between market-shaping actions and the multiple levels of market systems. © 2020, Valtteri Kaartemo, Suvi Nenonen and Charlotta Windahl.

AB  - We provide a systematic review of the literature on academic engagement from 2011 onwards, which was the cut-off year of a previous review article published in Research Policy. Academic engagement refers to knowledge-related interactions of academic scientists with external organisations. It includes activities such as collaborative research with industry, contract research, consulting and informal ties. We consolidate what is known about the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents of academic engagement, and its consequences for research, commercialisation, and society at large. Our results suggest that individual characteristics associated with academic engagement include being scientifically productive, senior, male, locally trained, and commercially experienced. Academic engagement is also socially conditioned by peer effects and disciplinary characteristics. In terms of consequences, academic engagement is positively associated with academics’ subsequent scientific productivity. We propose new areas of investigation where evidence remains inconclusive, including individual life cycle effects, the role of organisational contexts and incentives, cross-national comparisons, and the impact of academic engagement on the quality of subsequent research as well as the educational, commercial and society-wide impact. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The needs for precisely estimating a student’s academic performance have been emphasized with an increasing amount of attention paid to Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). However, since labels for academic performance, such as test scores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly, leading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine learning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired by the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing community, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative Pre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two models, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on academic performance prediction. In DPA’s pre-training phase, a sequence of interactions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is trained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an interaction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator’s outputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the sequence. We conduct extensive experimental studies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application and show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more robust to increased label-scarcity. © EDM 2021.All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies about the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to boost production and create competitive advantages in industrial firms and their associated workforce have filled many a literature review section. The role of tacit knowledge and its ability to transfer from instructor or professional to the student becomes important because this typically is the “secret sauce” that allows crafts persons to develop and achieve their potential. This study compares the relationship between the Film Industry and associated academic institutions seeking to educate for that industry in two different geographical locations, Norway and the United States, each offering a different industrial presence and employing correspondingly different pedagogical methodologies. The film industry has been chosen as the target discipline for this study because it relies heavily on a wide variety of tacit knowledge, held and implemented by its workers to achieve sustainable high-level productivity. The empirical data collected in Norway in 2018, and in the United States in 2019, is based on a structured questionnaire to professors and students from leading universities with film programs, and corresponding professionals from the film industry in each location. Additional qualitative interview data from the United States was collected in Los Angeles and Chicago, also in 2019. Findings indicate broad similarities in the generally perceived views of the state of collaboration, with professors and industry professionals agreeing on most topics in both locations, however, within the student sectors, there exist fairly disparate views regarding the effectiveness of collaboration, the knowledge transfer methodology, and even their own goals and aspirations. © The Authors, 2021.

AB  - The essence of innovation lies in knowledge, which is why open innovation opens the door to knowledge transfer with agents outside the organization. In order to comprehend the joint scientific trajectory of these two areas of knowledge, the aim of this study is to identify and analyze the main indicators of scientific behavior involved in the research field related to the link between open innovation and knowledge transfer or knowledge sharing concepts through bibliometric and network analysis. The results show clear European leadership in scientific production developed in universities. In addition, the high quality of the main sources of diffusion infers publications of good scientific quality. The most recognized source of knowledge used in new research is directed towards university-company relationships in an open innovation environment. Network analysis related to keywords has allowed us to define the most interesting, relevant fields of research, highlighting the importance acquired by topics such as ‘communication’, ‘inter-organizational context’ and ‘education’, to better focus on future research of the scientific community. It can be concluded that the scientific development of both concepts is an active field in the academic community, and also, that new key terms appear, opening new paths of research. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Communication is critical to engineering work, and despite its emphasis within engineering education, it is still noted as a gap in new engineers' preparedness for work. Literature review: Prior research points to communication gaps among new engineers. Few studies have extensively examined transitions between academic and professional engineering contexts. Work remains for understanding how new engineers transfer communication skills. Research questions: 1. In what ways do new engineers transfer communication practices from school to work? 2. What challenges do new engineers experience in moving from communication as practiced at school to communication as practiced at work? Research methodology: This study presents a thematic analysis of data from weekly reflections and regular semistructured interviews conducted during new engineers' first year of work. Results and conclusions: Despite relying heavily on academic experiences involving both documenting and presenting technical work, new engineers report experiencing communication-related challenges. While further attention to communication activities can be given within engineering curricula, the complexity and situated nature of communication in the workplace cannot be fully replicated in the classroom. As new engineers move between school and work, they experience challenges adapting to a new environment including communication activities embedded within unique sociocultural contexts. While the classroom cannot fully replicate these professional settings and all of their nuances, students can be made more fully aware of the embedded nature of communication activities. Moreover, engineering educators can simulate aspects of the workplace in capstone courses, and companies can provide guidance to help mentor new engineers through the inevitable context gaps.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Universities are coming under increasing pressure to produce impact that contributes to socio-economic development. Previous studies have focused on university technology transfer (UTT) mechanisms that lead to the commercialisation of intellectual property. We find that off-late, the legitimacy of such mechanisms, owing to high-failure rates of IP-based start-ups, has come into question. Universities are being invited to widen their academic entrepreneurship (AE) practices to include other forms of knowledge transfer. The increased attention on contemporary concepts such as social entrepreneurship calls for broadening UTT performance indicators to include multiple bottom-lines. These bottom-lines should amplify the societal benefits of AE. This new emphasis raises high-level questions about the societal role of universities and UTT. The aim in this paper is to, therefore, reframe the debate on UTT processes by highlighting a revised agenda for further research. This is done by analysing the extant literature on UTT, academic entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial universities and innovation. The analysis includes a critical review of 96 peer-reviewed articles. As a result, a macro perspective is presented which highlights UTT as-a-mechanism for universities’ contribution to collective societal goals. Propositions are outlined for future research; these can be used for developing new understanding on how universities can actively contribute to socio-economic development agendas. © 2021 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd

AB  - This study aims to present the relationship between universities and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through a systematic literature review. SMEs play an important role in economic development. Similarly, universities are important actors in the innovation system. To fulfil the study objective, data were collected from the Scopus database. The bibliometric results found, using bibliometrix software, reveal that this topic first appeared in the literature in 1995 and entered a growth stage in 2014. Systematically, studies have focused mostly on European countries and the emphasis in cooperation is on knowledge transfer. In addition, the results show that SMEs form cooperative relationships with universities in search of competitive results. However, the main difficulty with regard to the establishment of such relationships is a lack of knowledge in SMEs about university programmes that can support them and about how to access such programmes. Therefore, it is suggested that universities should establish more effective communication channels in order to reach this type of firm. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The considerable economic contribution of academic spin-offs (ASOs) has drawn numerous scholars’ attention to explore the factors that influence their development. The body of literature pertaining to this topic is growing, though the findings remain relatively controversial and fragmented. Existing literature reviews only describe the general phenomenon instead of focusing on precise areas. Therefore, the main objective of this review is to provide a holistic and in-depth exploration of the factors that drive, impede and are critical for the success of ASOs by posing three specific questions: (1) What drives academics to become entrepreneurs? (2) Which barriers must they overcome during the venturing process? (3) Which factors influence the success of ASOs? Following the basic procedure outlined by Tranfield et al. (Br J Manag 14(3):207–222, 2003) for conducting a systematic literature review, this research selected, evaluated, summarised and synthesised 193 relevant articles. The findings indicated that individual factors carried significantly higher explanatory power in relation to the entrepreneurial behaviour of academics. However, the venturing process and the success of ASOs are influenced not only by factors at the micro-level, but also strongly depend on factors at the meso and macro-levels such as relationships with parent organisations and regional contexts. Furthermore, factors that impede the ASO venturing process and factors at the macro-level are still under-researched and deserve further investigation. In addition, this review discusses several potential promising theoretical and practical implications for stakeholders at different levels, which should be helpful to further promote the development of ASOs in the future. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In recent decades, universities have put considerable emphasis on their ‘Third Mission’ and have thus expanded their portfolio of core activities to include activities related to university-industry collaboration and science commercialisation. An important mechanism to implement the university’s third mission is the creation of academic spinoffs that are start-ups based on research produced at universities and other public research institutions. Research on academic spinoffs has thus experienced significant growth, and several literature reviews have sought to map the often-fragmented knowledge in this topic area. Yet, we still lack an overview of the decision making of academic entrepreneurs and relevant stakeholders–an overview that is of paramount importance in the effort of scholars and policy-makers to understand what drives the creation of (more) academic spinoffs that have good chances of surviving and thriving. This paper is based on 60 papers published during the period 2003–2021 and provides a comprehensive overview of all topics covered in the body of literature on the entrepreneurial decision making of academic spinoffs, by identifying the most salient topics, papers, and trends within this literature. Our analysis shows that the literature on the topic clusters around four macro-areas: contextual factors, spinoff development and performance, nascent academic entrepreneurship, and science parks. Our study further compares and contrasts our findings with the highly influential framework for entrepreneurial decision making of Shepherd, Williams, and Patzelt [2015. “Thinking About Entrepreneurial Decision Making: Review and Research Agenda.” Journal of Management 41 (1): 11–46] and proposes future research directions in light of the unique characteristics of academic entrepreneurs and academic spinoffs. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.

AB  - Studies on University-Industry Collaboration (UIC) have mainly focused on processes at the individual and institutional levels. The result has been a proliferation of literature on aspects of UIC implementation processes often accounting for contextual differences. A survey of previous systematic reviews showed a gap in integration of knowledge on UIC implementation processes from a holistic and economic context perspective. This systematic review of the literature seeks to cover that gap by integrating the literature on UIC implementation processes from developed and developing countries contexts. In total 68 publications were reviewed and the data extracted were qualitatively analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Three major themes are distinguished: channels of interaction, UIC mechanisms, and barriers to UIC. The channels of interaction were often presented in categories. The most comprehensive were found to be bi-directional, traditional, commercial and service channels. It was found that commercial channels are ranked by both industry and academia as the least important and the least preferred by collaboration actors. The review discerned three major forms of UIC implementation processes: (1) educational collaboration, (2) academic entrepreneurship and (3) research related collaboration. Mechanisms of implementing these three forms of interaction vary, but continuous interactions are frequently proposed as the best method of knowledge transfer, contrasting with the traditional linear view of UIC processes. Regarding barriers to collaboration, five categories of barriers (misalignment barriers; motivation related barriers; capability related barriers; governance-related barriers and contextual barriers) are identified. The review indicated also that there is still a research coverage gap in developing countries compared to developed countries, and that the educational collaboration form is somehow neglected. It is therefore recommended to use an action research approach to advance research in developing countries and to provide extra attention to educational collaboration mechanisms since this form is among the preferred means of UIC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To accelerate digital transformation processes, more efforts are needed both in applied research and development as well as in practical implementation. For this reason, numerous learning and research factories have been build up during the last decade. The aim of this paper is to present an interdisciplinary concept model for a learning and research factory aiming to increase significantly the digital competences of concerned stakeholders. The proposed model has three dimensions: (i) content, (ii) function and (iii) methodology and is realized through a specific structure (Lab-in-Lab). Based on this concept model, the Smart Production Lab (Smart Lab) has been designed and implemented by the Institute of Industrial Management at FH JOANNEUM University of applied sciences, Austria. Essentially the Smart Lab is about the digital transformation of connecting businesses - horizontally along the entire value chain and vertically with focus on data generation, integration, and usage. The development of use cases in the two maturity levels - state-of-the-art and research - allows the transfer of knowledge of digital transformation processes for companies as well as active learning scenarios for the qualification of future industrial engineers. As an innovative experimental environment, the Smart Lab addresses companies, researchers, students, and - with the integrated fabrication laboratory (FabLab) - the interested public in general. © 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, it is relevant that this process has its flow of activities delimited from its peculiarities. However, little has been documented on the support networks for innovation structured by universities, companies, and government (triple helix) when a spin-off effort runs on universities. This study aimed to draw an international panorama on the relationship between academic spin-offs and universities through a systematic literature review of existing scientific publications. In the study, the importance of the triple helix and support policies for partnerships for academic spin-offs was identified. Literature also points to a demand for a deep understanding of resource allocations’ best time by business incubators and technology transfer offices. There is a research gap concerning the operational mechanisms that connect universities and spin-offs to potentialize their relations under a win-win perspective. © IEOM Society International.

AB  - Building evacuation training systems and training employees in an organization have a vital role in emergency cases in which people need to know what to do exactly. In every building, procedures, rules, and actions are attractively shown on the walls, but most of the people living in that building are not aware of these procedures and do not have any experience what to do in these dangerous situations. In order to be able to apply these procedures properly in an emergency situation, community members should be trained with the state-of-the-art equipment and technologies, but to do so, up-front investment and development of such a system are necessary. In this study, augmented reality (AR) technology was applied to realize a game-based evacuation training system that implements gamification practices. The architectural plans of a university were used to model the floors and the relevant environment. Employees are trained to learn how to reach the nearest exit location in the event of a fire or earthquake, and also, the system provides the shortest path for the evacuation. In addition to these features, our training game has educational animations about the fire, chemical attack, and earthquake events. A mobile application was implemented to train employees working in the building and inform them to know how to escape in an emergency situation. The technology acceptance model and the related questionnaire form were applied, and the response of 36 participants was analyzed. It was demonstrated that AR and relevant tools provide a flexible environment to develop evacuation systems in a university, our mobile application enabled participants to be trained in a realistic environment, and trainees were highly satisfied with the system. Educational animations were also another benefit for the trainees. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Object and purpose: Knowledge pills (KPs) are a technique for transferring knowledge through short factual batches of content. In education and vocational training, they can help learners acquire specific pieces of knowledge in a few minutes, through a “microteaching” approach where learners can be involved in active and interactive exercises, quizzes, and games. Thanks to the advancements of multimedia platforms, they can contain a mix of contents, i.e.: lecturer voice, images, videos, or other e-learning applications. This paper explores the state-of-the-art literature on KPs, with a special focus on their actual use as a mechanism to boost effective knowledge transfer and learning processes. The goals are a) to clarify the definition and peculiar characteristics of KPs; b) to classify their main typologies; c) to analyse their implications under a knowledge management perspective, and d) to highlight actual application fields, pros, and possible cons. Methodology: This study is based on a literature review by means of a search in global citation databases and on a snowball effect, with collective participation and sharing among all the authors. The articles found were then selected and carefully analysed. Findings: The advantages of KPs can be related to the division of knowledge into small parts, which also fits today’s needs of learners to “study faster” and acquire the specifically required knowledge. In addition, KPs are made of reusable materials and can be more easily updated than traditional supports. Possible limits are that designing a KP can be difficult, and careful consideration of the actual learning process and the mechanism by which a certain type of knowledge is transferred from a “knower” to a “learner” is required. Research limitations: Research is based on a limited literature review. However, this limitation is going to be overcome in future research. Practical implications: Findings provide useful insights not only for academics and researchers but also for teachers and trainers dealing with all types of education. © 2022 Academic Conferences Limited.

AB  - In this article a set of strategic interventions developed through the Erasmus + KA2 project entitled ‘Design and Innovation Capacity Building in India/DESINNO’ which is under implementation within the action ‘Capacity Building in the field of Higher Education’ are presented. The approach developed brings together an historical overview of design in India, an overview of Higher Educational Institutes (HEIs) and industry in relation to design in the country, a literature review of relevant emerging field in contemporary design, an overview of relevant sectorial reports from India and the European Union and fieldwork comprising of surveys and focus groups in India. This triangulation of the interventions chosen allows to move forward to the deployment of the strategy developed in three Indian HEIs. The maker movement, social innovation and grassroots innovation form a unity that is tailor made for the Strengths and Opportunities present in contemporary India. Design hubs, community makers spaces in HEIs, are the central pillar in this strategy. Additionally, the knowledge transfer to Indian academics and professional designers by European HEIs in an open and collaborative fashion aims to provide the necessary competences to support said design hubs. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The role of knowledge and technology transfer between academia and the industry has received increasing attention in the analysis of innovation. This article aims to explore the scientific literature concerning knowledge transport mechanisms and describe how the topic was organized by previous studies and terminologies applied. A systematic review was conducted in which the content of recent contributions best fitting these intensions was analysed. The characteristics of knowledge, individuals, organizations, and disciplines were found to be the main determinants in the adoption of transfer mechanisms. These were classified in terms of formalization, relational involvement, direction, and time. On the revealed multi-dimensionality of knowledge transfer and complementarity between transfer activities we framed a new taxonomy distinguishing between channels and processes. Future research may deepen these factors, such as the economic aspects driving the adoption of transfer mechanisms informing decisions on the funding of innovation.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The relationship between planning and restoration work, and the acquisition of data necessary for contextual understanding of Salūt, a large Iron Age site, are discussed. Its different historical contexts required close collaboration among architects, archaeologists, Ministry of Heritage and Culture staff, local workers and students from Sultan Qaboos University (SQU). A central aim was to awaken the interest of the community and encourage them to play an active role in the conservation of local heritage sites. This and the technical solutions adopted are also a focus of the paper. Intangible cultural heritage should be considered to be an integral part of the site. A number of activities was undertaken to develop sustainable responses for the management of Omani cultural heritage: historical and ethnographic research into the traditional techniques of mudbrick and mud plaster construction, with visits to surrounding villages to identify Omani residents familiar with the process; information storage, images, and video interviews for a multi-level, potentially replicable approach; creation and implementation of guidelines for the conservation of the mudbrick walls; organization of site visits, awareness-raising activities for local students and interested community members; the training of two female SQU students in stratigraphic excavation and conservation of artifacts; and the use of state-of-the-art surveying and 3D modeling for the evaluation of interventions. The program at Salūt site, until the interruption due to the pandemic, has produced largely positive results, and the methodology developed here can promote recovery of other archaeological sites similar to Salūt. © The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2022.

AB  - The mismatch of skills among youth graduates contributes towards existing social and economic challenges of poverty and unemployment especially among youths in most developing countries including Malaysia. Consequently, universities are mandated to transform into Entrepreneurial Universities as a third mission, driving state of the art knowledge, skills acquisition and entrepreneurial mindset that supports technological development and innovations to match up with the emerging needs of Malaysia's economy. Therefore, this study assesses the influence of entrepreneurial universities on the development of social capital. Questionnaires were used to retrieve data from a sample of 382 students in two Institutions. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The direct relationships between the three measures of entrepreneurial university (Input, Process and Output) indicated a positively significant relationship with social capital. However, the moderating effects of Entrepreneurial Intention were supported. Our paper contributes to the literature by examining the role of Entrepreneurial Universities using the three factors of inputs, processes and outputs on social capital development and concurrently examining the moderating effect of Entrepreneurial Intention. It also provides evidence-based support to develop models for emerging entrepreneurial universities in Malaysia which can help the national goal of reducing unemployment due to skill mismatch among graduates. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Audit academics and policymakers express ongoing concerns about limited knowledge transfer between audit research and policymaking. We use theory-based knowledge transfer norms to evaluate eight practices used by audit academics to transfer research knowledge to policymakers. The discontinued PCAOB-AAA Auditing Section “Research Synthesis Project” came closest to enacting these theory-based knowledge transfer norms. Hence, we examine why those involved in that project did not follow these norms. Interviews with project authors reveal that their review creation approach anchored on the traditional academic literature review, and insufficiently adjusted it to meet the goal of communicating audit research evidence to policymakers. However, interviews with PCAOB project liaisons indicate that policymakers were engaged with and found value in the review creation process. Thus, we analyze PCAOB rulemaking documents for evidence that policymakers valued and used the project's reviews in their policymaking. Over the project's duration, we find increasing citations of research to the reviews themselves and to a broader set of academic research. Our findings of knowledge transfer occurrence in this project warrant further research on the efficacy of mobilizing audit research via research syntheses. We also show how several current audit domain knowledge transfer practices can be combined with the research syntheses approach leading to systematic effective knowledge transfer to policymakers. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - This study aims to describe the perceptions and perspectives regarding the University-Industry collaboration of a spin-off developed by the technology park of a Federal University in Brazil. Initially, a literature review was conducted to identify facilitating aspects and barriers in UIC, and then a case study was conducted. This way, by means of an interview supported by a semistructured questionnaire, the facilitating aspects and barriers that they observe and experience during this process of development, collaboration, and technology transfer were addressed, as well as the positive and negative points of this process. In addition, the spin-offs perspectives related to the future of the contributions between universities and firms were analyzed. As a result of the case study, the need to further study and deepen the perspective of a new developing company, with the purpose of creating ways to eliminate obstacles so that the collaboration process occurs in a more fluid manner, thus providing greater technological development between the parties. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This research is defined as a study regarding on structured and systematized of existing literature review of the intersection between intellectual property management, management and technology transfer offices (TTOs). It takes a deeper look at requirements within universities, scientific institutions and the business environment should be interconnected with each other. The literature review shows that TTOs have control over the process of knowledge transfer and they have contributed to improving the efficiency of the use of production and human resources. In this paper, authors proposed the methodological tools based on methodology model, which identified success factors for using project management in TTO between two countries-Kazakhstan and Spain. Further, we used methodology is focused on solving the problems of quantitative analysis based on the use of primary data, which allowed us to reach a huge number of respondents without any restrictions, and secondary data from statistical database. Findings and results are summarized at the end of article show that Kazakhstan is following the path of the Spanish experience. However, Kazakhstan can become more successful in commercializing scientific technologies and transferring knowledge and technologies. In turn, Spain can use the data from our analysis to work on barriers and improve the activities of TTOs. © The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this study is to connect the perceptions and understanding of the collaboration of faculty members of NIRF ranked top-performing engineering institutes with the publication they have. The quantitative bibliometric analysis along with the enquiry with authors show that national collaboration, mainly with academic authors of same or other institution, still is a preferred. Despite international collaboration leading to more average citations, there is no significant gain seen. Scholars collaborate for many reasons, but mostly to gain popularity among peers or to receive citation benefits. Collaboration with private or government organizations, although uncommon, is primarily used to test newly developed ideas or to provide consultancy. Most of the respondents believe that funding is important for research collaborations and low commitment of team members to the shared goal is a major barrier in collaboration. We argue that as the share of University-Industry-Government research collaborations is low, a strong congruence between knowledge capital and entrepreneurial capital is needed to develop an entrepreneurial university. © 2022, National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the provision and reported outcomes of Experiential Entrepreneurship Education (EEE), from learner, educator and university perspectives, in order to reflect upon the progress of the Entrepreneurial University. It proposes a conceptual framework for integrating the multiple stakeholder perspectives for an “education led” and student-focused Entrepreneurial University, something yet to be identified from existing research and, consequentially, future research. Design/methodology/approach: A reflective literature review explores the depth and breadth of EEE provision in Universities, noting: what is taking place, who is involved, where EEE is situated (within the university context), and how the knowledge base is informed. From these reflections, a conceptual framework is proposed as a means of exploring and categorizing progress towards a student-focused Entrepreneurial University through education experiences. Findings: The literature review is largely informed by case studies developed by educators reflecting on student learner experiences for the purpose of course enhancement. These case exemplars provide the resource for emergent, bottom-up strategy that could support the Entrepreneurial University. However, the role of the University is less researched, in terms of providing context and external strategic relationships to resource EEE and deliver a more planned approach to the Entrepreneurial University. The Entrepreneurial University and EEE are mainstream agendas and the development of both must consider the role and contribution of the University in terms of strategy formulation and implementation. Originality/value: This study takes a holistic view, seeing EEE and the Entrepreneurial University as connected agendas. The student-focused Entrepreneurial University cannot result from emergent, bottom-up strategy alone and thus there is a need to address the role of top-down resource-based University strategy in creating real progress. The paper provides a conceptualization, for the purpose of analysing and informing the relationship between EEE and the Entrepreneurial University that places the University as a key stakeholder, and in doing so asks that scholars and educators build the knowledge base not only from cases of good practice but also from the review of strategic management within Universities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In order to redefine the university-society relationship, African universities aspire to forge new partnerships with local, national, regional, and international actors. Employing a critical review of the literature and an analysis of the strategic plans of regional African organisations and African universities, this study explores the challenges and opportunities of creating strategic university-society partnerships in Africa. Against a backdrop of African universities fashioned after modernity, the study draws from (1) "Mode 2" knowledge production, "Mode 3" research, entrepreneurial university, and academic capitalism, (2) the helices models and epistemic cultures, (3) power dynamics in international negotiations over educational policy, and (4) uBuntu and Cosmo-uBuntu, to inspire African universities towards contextual relevance and significance. Furthermore, the study proposes a conceptual framework of strategic international university-society partnerships to inform policy making, strategic planning, and further research. © 2021 University of Hradec Kralove, Philosophical Faculty.

AB  - Purpose: Studies have shown that organizations that are capable of effectively transferring knowledge are often more productive than others. At the same time, there is increasing ambiguity regarding how the nature of knowledge transfer affects performance. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on the nature of knowledge transfer and to understand why it remains a hindrance to most organizations, even now. This conceptual paper tries to identify the major debates surrounding the nature of knowledge transfer in an organization. The challenges and opportunities facing research on knowledge transfer are also elaborated. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper is structured to first provide a brief summary of the construct of knowledge transfer and then provide a detailed account of research that highlights the major findings regarding the nature of knowledge transfer and their relation to the current themes. A selective review of the literature was carried out in this paper instead of a meta-analysis. The papers were identified through popular databases. The authors also examined the references of selected papers to provide a comprehensive review of the construct. Findings: The debate about codification of knowledge that has stimulated the academic community in organizational studies is still in its infancy. The other debates that have been discussed in this paper have either reached their peak or have given way to newer debates. A clear understanding of the significance of the nature of knowledge transfer is very important at this juncture. The model developed toward the end of the paper assumes a path in this direction. The authors also discuss how research on knowledge has both deepened and expanded the authors’ understanding of knowledge transfer since March and Simon (1958). Originality/value: The debate in the field of organizational studies around the nature of knowledge transfer has been occurring for some time. However, there has not been any final consensus on the nature of knowledge transfer. While looking at these debates with a critical eye, the authors may appear to be cynical about the prospect of an end to these deliberations. The authors conclude the paper with a model that examines knowledge transfer from a broader perspective that encompasses the various theoretical perspectives. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper reviews the Academic Entrepreneurship literature according to the emergence of powerful Digital technologies, providing an overview of the state of research and outlining a future research agenda about Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. One hundred and sixty-five journal papers were initially extracted from Scopus and their content was analysed for the paper selection process by two researchers in parallel, plus a third one in case of uncertainty. Finally, fifty-nine papers dealing with digital academic entrepreneurship and published in a variety of academic journals have been analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis. Findings show that literature on Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is really scant and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis provides the emergence of four major research streams: 1) Digital Technologies for Entrepreneurship Education; 2) The “maker space movement” for Academic Entrepreneurship; 3) Digital technologies for discovering entrepreneurial opportunities; 4) Creating entrepreneurial competences in the Digital “University-based” Entrepreneurial ecosystems. The paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive structured literature review of the disruptive role of digital transformation for the Academic Entrepreneurship. Despite the growing literature on Digital Entrepreneurship, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized. More systematic and holistic studies, considering both the technological, economic and the social aspects of Academic Entrepreneurship are required. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This research aims to expand the explanations about the debate on academic entrepreneurship and other knowledge transfer mechanisms, to respond to what extent entrepreneurial intention affects the diffusion and dissemination of knowledge in a Mexican university. The lack of indicators of commercial activity, leads us to propose the analysis of a pre-commercial stage of technology that we call entrepreneurial intention. After the literature review, we present a database of academic inventors in patents granted to the university, identifying patenting with an entrepreneurial intention, following Lomas (1993) knowledge transfer taxonomy. Data about publications and received citations by academic inventors is also considered for knowledge diffusion; as well as the supervision of end-of-degree projects in undergraduate and graduate studies; before and after the patent was granted, for knowledge dissemination. Using a binomial model, we estimated two data sets, one for the period 1984-2000 and the second for 2001-2020. Our findings reveal, an average increase of 60% in the number of patents obtained. We also found that the characteristics of the research group are significant in both models, but in the 2001-2020 period it is more important to integrate foreign inventors than patenting with firms, the dissemination of knowledge is more significant and has greater importance in the model. To respond to what extent entrepreneurial intention affects the diffusion and dissemination of knowledge, greater attention should be paid to the diffusion of knowledge since in both models the variable that represents publications after patenting is not significant. The explanation about the dissemination of knowledge improves substantially from one period to another. © 2021, Universitat de Barcelona, Facultad de Economia y Empresa. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article discusses a literature review regarding the dynamics and policies adopted by the government to manage knowledge transfer. This paper also discusses knowledge transfer activities in Japan, which is focused on the model of knowledge transfer and policies implemented in Japan and the importance of regulative pressure to optimise the transfer of knowledge. Literature on knowledge transfer between university and industry, specifically in Indonesia, is still limited and lead to the gap on related studies. This literature review was conducted to fill the gap that focused on dynamics and policies of knowledge transfer between university and industry. Through the discussion, it is expected to give insights and lesson learned for organisations in Indonesia to manage knowledge transfer activities between universities and industries.

AB  - Orientation: Innovation is forged by sub-revolutions as described by the quadruple helix (QH) model. Research purpose: Innovation model formation is complex, and the useful QH model can develop and improve to be exemplary. Motivation for the study: The rationale of the study is to validate and improve the QH model with additional concepts, fresh perspectives of experts and the investigation of the primary sub-revolutions forging innovation. Research design, approach and method: A conceptual and critical review approach implied narrative data of the model from secondary sources; a convenience sample of five innovation experts for critical reviews was thematically analysed. Main findings: Ultimately, the improved QH model must accommodate the legal, moral and ethical world to merge with the physical, biological and digital worlds; appropriate terminology for QH innovation leadership is needed, and triple technology theory (TTT) should be incorporated with the triple management theory (TMT) dimension of the model; the review conformed the sub-revolutions of innovation with respect to (1) innovation leadership, upscaling agility and innovation essentials, (2) the triple helix (TH) ecosystems sub-revolution and epochal society and (3) the new technological paradigm, technology intensity and TMT. Practical/managerial implications: The already useful QH model is confirmed and may develop to become exemplary with respect to the hypothetical improvements suggested. Contribution/value-add: A fresh and improved QH model is suggested in the context of complex innovation model formation and the paucity of literature. © 2022. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

AB  - The ongoing societal and technological changes make it necessary for universities to modify their teaching and learning programs. Regarding the cooperation with stakeholders that have influence on how it could be designed can serve as a basis. With this article we examine the recent contributions in the field of cooperation of higher education (HE) institutions by conducting a structured literature review. A close regard in particular are the interdependences between stakeholders in order to build a basis for future curricula developments. For our conceptualization, we use the quadruple helix model to analyse the educational ecosystems. Therefore in particular the term “educational ecosystem” is taken into account. The results show that evenso that the term is used there is a lack of suitable definitions in this context. So based on the analysis of the recent literature, a definition of educational ecosystem was introduced and the quintuple helix model, which was constructed for the conceptualization of the topic, was extended by further important aspects - knowledge transfer and adaptivity.

AB  - Today's healthcare challenges with unmet clinical needs, high regulation and certification standards, and increasing costs demand faster innovation and technical translation. To address this challenge, Stanford released a fellowship called Biodesign, where need-based healthcare innovation is taught with the approach identify, invent and implement. Since then, different European institutions have adopted the Biodesign innovation approach and organized within the Biomedical Engineering-Innovation, Design, and Entrepreneurship Alliance (BMEidea EU). The generation of successful healthcare innovation isn't only based on participating in an Innovation teaching program. It is much more a matter of having the right innovation ecosystem with an open creative mindset, experts, the respective stakeholders, and access to essential resources within reach (close to clinic). Through a qualitative survey, seven Biodesign based teaching programs in the EU were examined. The study from an academic perspective contains information covering Resources, Activities, Academic Performance, and Transfer Performance. The demand for new healthcare innovations, and especially innovation training programs that address challenges, developed collaboratively with the respective stakeholders, is increasing. Additionally, there is a growing expectation that innovation needs to reach the market quickly and be implemented accordingly. A Healthcare Innovation Ecosystem, where different entities function as a productive unit with a shared vision and committed to application-driven research and technology transfer, will increase innovation's success and adaptation.  © 2021 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Technological innovations are crucial for a country’s economic growth as they often have radical innovation potential. Although recognized as a key role in the innovation process, lots of technologies remain unexploited. University spin-offs (USOs) have the potential to transfer technologies into technological innovations. Often though, in universities there is a lack of consideration of potential implementation right from the start. The so-called fuzzyfront end (FFE) stage is crucial for successful innovation, as no commercialization can be achieved without the identification of a suitable application. This represents a critical hurdle, as of to date appropriate approaches for a successful systematic identification and validation of technology applications are missing. Furthermore, most investigating studies rely on data from spin-offs that are already operating successfully on the market and have therefore survived the critical initial stages of development, without highlighting the FFE of their process. This fact makes the pre-development activity of opportunity recognition appear to be a scientifically neglected topic. In this research a mixed-method approach is conducted to investigate the critical hurdles in the technology application selection (TAS) process of technologies, consisting of an extended literature review, completed by interviews with stakeholder involved in the USOs ecosystem. Striving to uncover the black box of the FFE, the study aims to specify and operationalize requirements for application identification of technologies. These findings are of relevance for researchers and practitioners which like to facilitate the exploration of potential technological innovation. © 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

AB  - Purpose: There is little known about investigating the importance of all proximity dimensions simultaneously as a result of geographical proximity on university-industry collaborative innovation. This paper aims to answer the question of how geographically proximate university and industry influence cognitive, social, organizational, institutional and cultural proximity within university-industry joint laboratories and finally, what is the outcome of these interplays on collaborative innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an exploratory multiple-case study approach. The results are derived from 53 in-depth, semistructured interviews with laboratory directors and representatives from both the company and the university within 8 joint laboratories of Telecom Italia (TIM). The data collection was carried out in 2014 and 2015. The analysis follows a multi-grounded theory approach and relies on a mix of deductive and inductive reasoning with the final goal of theoretical elaboration. Findings: This study finds the role of social and cultural proximity at the individual level as a result of geographical proximity as an enabler of collaborative innovation by triggering mutual learning, trust formation and frequent interactions. Cognitive proximity at the interface level could systematically influence collaborative innovation, while organizational and institutional proximity has marginal roles in facilitating collaborative innovation. The qualitative analysis offers a conceptual framework for proximity dimensions and collaborative innovation within university-industry joint laboratories. Practical implications: The framework not only advances state-of-the-art university-industry collaboration and proximity dimension but also offers guidance for managers in designing collaborative innovation settings between university and industry. Originality/value: With this study, the paper advances the understanding beyond solely the relationship between proximity and collaboration and shed light on the interplay between geographical proximity and other proximity dimensions in this context, which has received limited scholarly attention. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The University-Industry (U-I) relationship is a fundamental part of innovation systems. A wide spread of public resources has been given to promote this relationship and a large number of studies has evaluated the results. However, while innovation theory identifies this relationship as a positive instrument to increase firms' performance, evaluation literature reports a wide range of findings. The lack of conclusiveness results in theory and evaluation literature motivates this meta-regression analysis (MRA), built on fifty-one micro-level studies published since 1995. After controlling for publication selection bias, sample, and study heterogeneities, our results show a small effect on firms' performance. Specifically, the size of the effect is more significant for technical outcomes than economic ones. These findings have a lot of relevance for universities, firms, and policymakers for determining open-innovation strategies and public policies.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Digital technology has become a new economic and social force, reshaping traditional business models, strategies, structures, and processes. This is a challenge for human capital to develop continuously in this dynamic era; one of the solutions is digital entrepreneurship. Digital entrepreneurship focuses on creating new ventures and transforming existing businesses by developing novel digital technologies or novel usage. Further, digital technology has also enabled the growth of the sharing economy, linking owners and users, and disrupting the previous dualism of businesses and customers. This paper provides a novel contribution regarding the emerging concept of Digital Entrepreneurship. Based on a qualitative literature review and interview with university staff, lecturers, and students in four large public and private universities in West Java and DIY Province, an interpretative framework for Digital Entrepreneurship has been proposed, which comprises of the following components: motivation (the rationale for the adoption of digital technology for academic entrepreneurship), stakeholders (the stakeholders involved through digital technology to achieve the academic entrepreneurship goal), process (the processes of academic entrepreneurship supported by digital technologies), and business form (the emerging forms of digital academic entrepreneurship). This research also shows several alternative government policies to improve digital entrepreneurship in the academic environment. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - Fostering entrepreneurial mindset and opportunity recognition have always been essence in entrepreneurship education. Many contextual, environmental, social, personal and psychological factors have been studied in entrepreneurship research to understand antecedents of opportunity recognition. To date although studies on digitalization in academic entrepreneurship as antecedents of opportunity recognition are a new growing stream of research many of these studies are still undertheorized or need a robust theoretical background. The paper provides a literature review on digital learning tools and technologies in entrepreneurship education research and contributes to academic entrepreneurship literature through incorporating theoretical framework suggestions. Scopus is used to extract research studies by entering the key work digitalization, digital infrastructure and academic entrepreneurship to identify innovative digital technologies used in entrepreneurship education. The study aims to understand theoretically how such digital technologies cultivate intellectual capital and entrepreneurial mindset in facilitating opportunities in academia. Building upon a multidisciplinary theoretical approach the paper intends to provide a conceptual theoretical framework on how innovative digital learning methods provide an effective learning platform in cultivating entrepreneurial mindset. Grounded on various cognitive theories, entrepreneurship theory and economy theory the paper aims to theoretically address how digital platforms and digital infrastructures contribute to opportunity recognition in academic entrepreneurship. The conceptual framework has also implications for cognitive processes, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and creativity. Suggestions are provided for future avenues of research in entrepreneurship education and curricula. © IEOM Society Inweternational.

AB  - University-industry R&D collaborations (UICs) play a vital role in stimulating open innovation that leads to new products, processes, and services that creates value for customers and broader societal impact. UICs, however, commonly fail to meet these stakeholders' benefits. This study identifies thirty-four critical success factors (CSFs) for improving UIC success. The study includes a systematic literature review and a longitudinal UIC case study between Bosch Car Multimedia in Portugal and University of Minho, a multi-million Euro R&D collaboration from 2013 to 2021. The importance of the CSFs is discussed in the context of the UIC lifecycle. A survey among researchers and industry practitioners involved in R&D collaborative projects was completed to confirm the analysis of the empirical results. This paper provides UIC managers with CSFs, which, when addressed competently, can provide a basis for successful UIC projects and sustainable university-industry collaborations.  © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This paper delves into the intricate interplay of leadership dynamics, governance, and regulatory concepts within a South African university-based entrepreneurship center (EC). Guided by Kolb’s (2014) experiential learning model (Kolb, 2014), the research aims to understand how experiential learning shapes leadership and the “self” within the EC, unraveling the nuanced relationship between leadership, personal mastery, governance, and regulatory compliance. The methodology integrates experiential insights, literature reviews, and systems analysis. Key findings highlight the implicit integration of governance and regulatory concepts, ensuring ethical standards adherence. Senge’s (2006) fifth discipline model emphasizes the pivotal role of a learning culture, while concepts of governance structure learning processes and ensure compliance. Personal mastery aligns with governance, emphasizing leaders’ responsibility for ethical standards and continuous self-improvement. Short’s (1998) insights on learning in relationships and Kaner’s (2014) facilitation guide contribute to the governance of participatory decision-making processes within the EC. The methodology contributes to a conceptual framework exploring the reciprocal influence between leadership and the “self”. The study concludes by offering actionable strategies for EC leaders, emphasizing adaptability, collaboration, and a profound understanding of leadership dynamics, governance, and regulatory concepts. Its relevance lies in guiding EC leaders toward sustained growth in the ever-evolving entrepreneurship ecosystem. © 2024 The Author.

AB  - Companies cannot overcome the increasing complexity of nowadays cyber-physical systems alone. Thus, the industry uses academic research as an important source for gaining new knowledge and technologies. However, a successful exchange is fraught with barriers, so it is important to understand the success factors and barriers. This paper presents a model explaining the most relevant success factors and barriers to industry-academia collaborations and their relations. Based on a systematic literature review, an interview study, an online survey, and focus groups, we identified 22 relevant success factors and 22 barriers. We clustered these success factors and barriers into five categories: communication & feedback, information & (technical) support, motivation & commitment, people & team, and structure & organization. We believe that our model will help improve industry-academia collaboration's success by raising awareness of the barriers and offering success factors as setting levers. Furthermore, our model can serve as the basis for further research of methods for and to support industry-academia collaboration. Therefore, we intend to develop a methodology for challenge-driven industry-academia collaboration. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.

AB  - In STEM education, many 4-year colleges and universities now get most of their students from community colleges. Students who transfer from community colleges, especially those who are underrepresented, often face problems, such as deciding whether or not to transfer, getting academic and non-academic support during the transfer, and finding a job. Also, program advisors at both 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities face problems because they need to know how their students make transfer decisions and how to help them be successful post-transfer. A data-driven and survey-based study will help establish a solid understanding of the underlying elements contributing to these challenges. In this paper, the researchers first conduct a literature review to identify the critical personal and academic factors that influence the transfer decision, particularly for students from traditionally disadvantaged groups. Secondly, an exploratory analysis of these factors was performed by inviting a small group of computing major students from both community colleges and universities to participate in a survey that includes a wide range of questions, from demographics and pre-transfer decisions to post-transfer performance. The preliminary findings indicated that financial challenges, university reputation, university location, job prospects, and family expectations are the primary factors influencing student transfer decisions. The findings of the study can be beneficial to underrepresented transfer students, their advisors, and other stakeholders in higher education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - Globalization and internationalization have received increasing attention from researchers in the field of education management over the past decade, who have found that internationalization is an indispensable component in the sustainable development of higher education (HE). This research aims to construct Innovative Marketing Strategies (IMS) for international student recruitment and contribute to the sustainable internationalization of higher education (IoHE). A literature review was used to construct an Innovative Marketing Strategies questionnaire. Data collected from 300 international students studying in Taiwan were used for a feasibility analysis in order to construct the final questionnaire, and survey data collected from 522 participants were used for more in-depth statistical analysis of the final strategies. The research results indicate that combining the marketing mix 4C with an innovative strategy (IS) approach provides sustainable recruitment marketing strategies toward higher education institution internationalization from a customer-oriented perspective. The IMS in this study includes 2 dimensions, 10 strategies, and 32 indicators. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis demonstrating the perspectives of international students with respect to the strategies was also conducted. This research contributes to the theoretical development and practical implementation of sustainable HE internationalization management. Discussions and recommendations based on the results of this study are also given. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to synthesize the literature that has been established on the interrelationship of “knowledge spillovers and entrepreneurial ecosystem” through a systematic literature review. The query strings generated 85 articles, of which 51 were selected for final review. The analysis was performed using MySLR software that uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method, and the effectiveness was measured through the perplexity score and coherence value of the topics. The results reveal that although a plethora of literature is available on these two topics individually, the mutual relationship between these two concepts is understudied. A stronger research interest was observed after 2018 which indicates the infancy of the topic as a whole, which is yet to be explored and empirically tested, specifically in developing economies. Most of the research was focused on the role of universities, innovation, geographic dynamics and policies with respect to entrepreneurial ecosystems. Results reveal the disparity of knowledge spillovers with regard to other contributors; significantly lesser attention was paid to its role in relation to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Along with critical analysis and synthesis of literature, future directions have also been presented in the paper. © 2023 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The metallic components are manufactured through several thermomechanical processes. Each selected procedure has multiple targets. The first target is to obtain the required dimensional criteria and second, to achieve the ideal mechanical response toward the application. This is currently accomplished through years of knowhow combined with an academic background of materials science and engineering. Since metals are polycrystalline materials, the several rotations of the crystals, the preferred orientation also known as texture, and their interactions, are crucial characteristics that are directly correlated to the final response of the material, and one could apprehend its thermomechanical prehistory as well as predict is behavior. Different atomic arrangements act differently texture-wise therefore in the current review article, the evolution of the microstructure and the crystallographic texture through the thermomechanically rolling process especially of Al alloys for packaging applications is analyzed. The crystallographic texture evolution in 3xxx Al alloys in different processing routes is presented and compared to the anisotropic effects occurring during deep drawing. The earing phenomena in Al alloys are correlated to the produced texture and therefore their understanding is crucial in order to highlight the importance of texture control throughout the thermomechanical process. © 2022 International Union of Crystallography.

AB  - The motivation that leads researchers to engage in patenting and licensing activities is a complex topic that needs to be further investigated, especially in emerging countries. In Brazil, universities stand out as the main patent depositors, being important actors in the country's technological development process. The objective of this study is to present the profile of researchers from Brazilian universities and the motivational factors that lead them to patent the results of their research. Based on a literature review, 27 factors were identified, which were classified according to the nature of motivation and expected results. Data from curricula vitae were collected to verify the researchers' academic and sociodemographic profile. A survey was conducted to measure the importance attributed to different motivational factors. The results show that, in addition to the royalties established in Brazilian legislation, universities need to provide other conditions and incentives to engage more researchers in patenting and licensing activities. Therefore, this study can provide subsidies for the formulation of policies aimed at promoting innovation and technology transfer in Brazilian universities. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The rapid transition to digitalise all processes in the manufacturing field has promoted the introduction of new manufacturing technologies. However, few have focused on how to create synergies in R&D through university-industry collaboration (UIC) in the relevant fields. To fill the research void, in this study, we analysed the research trends of industry and university with a focus on the technological field of digital twins (DTs), which has recently attracted attention, and we explored partner selection for effective UIC strategies in the field. The results suggest that the university focuses on intelligent production systems using AI technology, whereas the industry focuses on industrial digitalisation platforms for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. The methodology proposed in this study can be applied to other industrial fields that require the UIC strategy. The research findings provide useful guidelines concerning UIC for industry practitioners and academic researchers in DTs. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - University-industry collaboration (UIC) is viewed as a means to boost innovation through knowledge sharing. The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance ranking of factors influencing UIC and UIC models in the context of Vietnam. To begin, a systematic literature review (SLR) of previous academic studies on the subject of university-industry collaboration was conducted in order to identify the influential factors in UIC. The order ranking of factors and their relevance weights are then determined using the fuzzy AHP approach. The fuzzy TOPSIS is then used to evaluate three models for UIC, including collaboration in scientific research, technology transfer, and training. The results show that the number of scientists and experts and the awareness of the benefits of cooperation are the most important factors in implementing UIC; meanwhile, the experience of cooperation and training activities and student recruitment activities are evaluated less important than others. In addition, in the context of Vietnam, among UIC models, the technology transfer collaboration should be prioritized. Finally, based on the findings, discussions and policy implications are provided to promote UIC activities. © 2024 Malque Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Entrepreneurial development in Latin America is varied and complex. The concept of reflexivity can be used to investigate the complexities of the entrepreneurial system in Latin America; however, it has rarely been used in entrepreneurship, which refers to finding strategies to question our attitudes, thought processes, values, assumptions, prejudices, habitual actions, and understanding how we relate to others. To explore reflexivity and how this area can provide support to reimagine Latin American entrepreneurial dynamics, a literature review was conducted, and two theoretical models were proposed that show the complexity of the region and routes where reflexivity can foster a path for the region to change and advance its entrepreneurial efforts.  © 2023 Oscar Javier Montiel Méndez et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Research on open innovation (OI) has increased in recent years, showing its potential in various areas of knowledge. Its relation to small and medium-sized enterprises has attracted the attention of academics. This article aims to evaluate the intellectual structure of the scientific study of OI, and its close relationship with various scientific fields, through a bibliometric analysis of this academic field using the Scopus database and the application of the VOSviewer software. The methodology comprises a rigorous systematic and transparent process divided into four phases: (i) the establishment of search criteria for the research field, through a literature review for its selection; (ii) the selection of the database, the establishment of the search equation and extraction of information; (iii) the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selected documents and an explanation of the usefulness of the software; and (iv) the analysis of the results through the approaches of scientific output performance and bibliometric mapping. The results show an increasing trend of IO publications in SMEs, consolidated in 396 articles with contributions from 65 countries and 947 authors. The intellectual structure shows seven themes related to firm performance, R&D networks, business management, business models, capabilities and knowledge transfer. This study contributes to the field by providing an overview of IO in SME contexts. It also provides insightful information to policymakers for developing policies for firm economic growth. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper analyses the impact of relational capital and relationship networks on business internationalisation, in particular in the technology sector in relation to internationalised Andalusian university spin-offs. First, a literature review based on these theories is carried out, from which a series of hypotheses are established in a pioneering way. These allow us to design a model of relationships that is empirically tested through a quantitative analysis. The study constructs were measured using five-point Likert scales. Once the data had been collected through the survey developed, they were coded for statistical analysis using the SPSS Statistics V28.0 programme. It is shown that the output of the international activity of these companies depends on their capacity to develop and sustain relationships with each of the different actors involved. Along this line, university spin-offs obtain diverse and strategically valuable external information and resources, significantly reducing business failure chances. The elements that influence the internationalisation process of the companies under study are relationships with customers, allies/collaborators, suppliers, and the company’s reputation and image. Similarly, those referring to relations with competitors, public bodies, and organisations have less impact. Nevertheless, it is evident that companies need to commit more time and resources to create, maintain, and develop relationships with different actors. Therefore, a strategic tool focused on international management is provided, based on the relationships of the spin-offs studied, which may constitute a starting point for its applicability to other industrial sectors and geographical areas. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Subsidiary Performance (SP) remains central to International Business (IB) research. Yet, exactly how to measure SP is a matter of some confusion in the academic literature. Indeed, to date, no review has offered a systematic overview of the variety of SP measures deployed in the IB literature. Based on a bibliometric study of 193 quantitative research articles published in top-tier journals from 1982 to 2022, this review provides a science mapping overview of SP measurements. By use of bibliographic coupling analyses, the review finds high variability of measurements within thematic clusters of research, for example within studies of knowledge transfer. This variation hampers the ability to both build and test IB theory. Furthermore, it is highly problematic in view of recent debates about replication within the social sciences. Therefore, the review proposes a range of questions to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate SP measure(s) for future studies. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article probes the transition of an emerging higher education system into the entrepreneurial model. Tunisia's alignment with the European Bologna Process reforms in 2008 was meant to ease graduates’ transition to the job market through enhancing their employability skills as well as injecting them with an entrepreneurial proclivity to mainstream self-employment as a worthy career path. Several measures were introduced across public universities, including a transversal entrepreneurship module and a corresponding entrepreneurship support structure of technology transfer office and incubators. North's new institutional lens will be used to frame the discussion analytically. The article goes beyond such formal interventions and particularly looks into the informal aspects of the newly-assumed entrepreneurial identity of Tunisian higher education. Following a scoping review approach informed by PRISMA-ScR guidelines, it investigates some informal matters on the shop floor to ascertain the extent to which the new identity has been established more than a decade after the introduction of the reforms. It looks into the profile of the purpose-hired teaching staff entrusted with delivering the cross-curricular entrepreneurship module; students’ and academics’ networks and rapport with the staff of the recently-established support structure; as well as their openness to the Tunisian entrepreneurial ecosystem. Empirical findings from the scoping review suggest a misalignment between progressive formal measures on the one hand and, on the other, a persistently unconducive university environment structured along deep-seated collegial values and quite decoupled from the realities of its national ecosystem. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Academic entrepreneurship is an activity that refers to researchers at universities who commercialize university research through business activities. Academic entrepreneurship can also be interpreted as a process of creating economic value through the creation, renewal, and organizational innovation that occurs inside and outside the university which results in the commercialization of research and technology transfer. The importance of academic entrepreneurship at the university level is directed to change the traditional view to a new view that sees Higher Education as an educational institution but is able to generate financial resources to cover operational costs. The purpose of this study is to analyze the extent to which academic research on entrepreneurship has been carried out. The research methodology used is literature review, by identifying entrepreneurship academic journals through the assistance of Scopus and Vosviewer. Based on the analysis, it was found that many journal publications on academic entrepreneurship were carried out in 2012. The research method used was mostly a qualitative method, with a literature review analysis. Then this type of paper is mostly in the Q1 quartile, countries that apply academic entrepreneurship a lot are the United States and England. © 2023 Author(s).

AB  - University-industry relationships have been central in technology and management innovation literature for decades. Success has been one of the most relevant topics in this field, driving a high proportion of this research. Our objective is to analyze this literature. Based on a framework of the motivations and expected benefits of the partners, classifying them into six categories (technological, strategic, financial, educational, political and epistemological), we have carried out a bibliographic coupling analysis to determine the topic's knowledge structure. We show how these themes have evolved, with some remaining central during the entire timeframe and others gaining academics' attention in recent years. We offer a research schedule and a dynamic, interpretative model that classifies and organizes the motivations of success for university-industry collaboration. This analysis can help in the formulation and implementation of public and private programs that aim to promote cooperation between firms and universities.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Academics and practitioners agree that there are substantial barriers to systematically transferring audit research knowledge to policy-makers. We adopt a design science approach to investigate the efficacy of employing a research synthesis, embedded in an interactive process with audit standard setters, to transfer such knowledge. We identify a standard-setting issue that, we argue, is typical of the class of problems encountered by both parties when attempting knowledge transfer. Following design science prescriptions, we evaluate the pragmatic validity of our prototype research synthesis and its creation process. We provide initial evidence (“proof of concept”) that a research synthesis process can effectively and efficiently facilitate academic research knowledge transfer to inform audit standard setters' deliberations. Finally, we provide evidence that the problem of academic research knowledge transfer in accounting standard setting and evaluation continues. Our study and findings reflect how design science facilitates change in real-world problem contexts through research-based proofs of concept. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to systematically review and evaluate extant literature on knowledge acquisition and transfer in international small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and to identify the requisite types of knowledge acquired and transferred in this context. The research further determines the mechanisms enabling SMEs to process this knowledge, unpacks the benefits of both knowledge acquisition and transfer for international SMEs and links them to the market success. Design/methodology/approach: The research has conducted a comprehensive systematic review of existing literature on market knowledge acquisition and its transfer, in the context of international SMEs, utilizing peer-reviewed articles published in top tier journals without any custom range of time. Findings: The search strategy resulted in 37 reviewed academic articles, whose analysis identifies and elucidates on the best practices of knowledge acquisition and transfer in the context of international SMEs; the type of the knowledge acquired and transferred; the form and mechanism of the intersection of these processes; and the benefits gained. The findings, crucially, also identify and illuminate extant research gaps and insufficiencies and develop a comprehensive research agenda for the way forward. Originality/value: The present study offers a uniquely comprehensive perspective on a topic of diachronic and, currently, rising significance to scholars and practitioners alike. Transcending its descriptive value, though, it further identifies extant knowledge deficiencies, it distils and consolidates critical knowledge and prescribes avenues for research towards the growth and development of international SMEs and born globals. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to describe the relationship between local Mapalus culture as a practical form of knowledge transfer from academic literature. Theoretical framework: Knowledge nowadays is considered valuable and can keep increasing along with its use. Therefore, knowledge transfer was believed to be an essential factor in implementing knowledge resources and fostering innovation in organizations. Knowledge transfer is a form of information, expertise, experience, idea, and suggestion exchange, which is thought to have a relationship with the Mapalus culture. Therefore, it is also presumed that mapalus is knowledge transfer in practices. Method/design/approach: Literature review approach to see the deeper links between knowledge transfer and local culture mapalus and interviews with several knowledge management experts and mapalus cultural experts. Results and conclusion: The study found contradictory results relating to mapalus. Several national researchers explain that mapalus culture is still well implemented; some researchers explain mapalus has started to lose its original identity due to the entry of financial transactions. Research implications: contradictory research about mapalus raises doubts that knowledge transfer could be practiced through mapalus cultural activities that may not be able to foster innovation capabilities in society and Mapalus' goal of reducing poverty may not be realized if lost its original identity. Originality/value: The present study is unique, where it offers the meaningful explanation mapalus culture and its relation on knowledge transfer in local society. © 2023 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Antarctica is of great importance in terms of global warming, the sustainability of resources, and the conservation of biodiversity. However, due to 99.66% of the continent being covered in ice and snow, geological research and geoscientific study in Antarctica face huge challenges. Geophysical surveys play a crucial role in enhancing comprehension of the fundamental structure of Antarctica. This study used bibliometric analysis to analyze citation data retrieved from the Web of Science for the period from 1982 to 2022 with geophysical research on Antarctica as the topic. According to the analysis results, the amount of Antarctic geophysical research has been steadily growing over the past four decades as related research countries/regions have become increasingly invested in issues pertaining to global warming and sustainability, and international cooperation is in sight. Moreover, based on keyword clustering and an analysis of highly cited papers, six popular research topics have been identified: Antarctic ice sheet instability and sea level change, Southern Ocean and Sea Ice, tectonic activity of the West Antarctic rift system, the paleocontinental rift and reorganization, magmatism and volcanism, and subglacial lakes and subglacial hydrology. This paper provides a detailed overview of these popular research topics and discusses the applications and advantages of the geophysical methods used in each field. Finally, based on keywords regarding abrupt changes, we identify and examine the thematic evolution of the nexus over three consecutive sub-periods (i.e., 1990–1995, 1996–2005, and 2006–2022). The relevance of using geophysics to support numerous and diverse scientific activities in Antarctica becomes very clear after analyzing this set of scientific publications, as is the importance of using multiple geophysical methods (satellite, airborne, surface, and borehole technology) to revolutionize the acquisition of new data in greater detail from inaccessible or hard-to-reach areas. Many of the advances that they have enabled be seen in the Antarctic terrestrial areas (detailed mapping of the geological structures of West and East Antarctica), ice, and snow (tracking glaciers and sea ice, along with the depth and features of ice sheets). These valuable results help identify potential future research opportunities in the field of Antarctic geophysical research and aid academic professionals in keeping up with recent advances. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In the field of human morphology, despite its growing interest in translational anatomy research, its contributions are often unknown. Scientific articles and patents are highly reliable sources of knowledge for measuring scientific progress and technology transfer. The aim of this article is a bibliometric study of the potential of anatomical translational research. Our methodological framework has consisted of a combination of the analysis of two variables: 1) academic papers, and 2) patents of anatomical scientific achievements. The established time range has been 2000-2020 and the database used The Lens (https://www.lens.org), establishing “anatomical science” as the keyword. In the systematic analysis, 11,547 scientific documents and 1,511 patent registrations have been carried out; inclusion criteria were applied to both groups to identify their quantitative and qualitative trends. Our results identified that scientific articles on translational anatomical achievements have an exponential growth rate similar to the growth of patent applications for translational anatomical sciences. The maximum number of contributions of journal articles and patents corresponds to the temporal range of 2010 and 2020, with 2020 being the most productive year; academic documents represented 54.90% and patents produced represented 45.08%, which are significant data if they are compared with the year 2000, when the respective percentages were 76.40% and 23.50%, an indicator of a clear increase in the culture of patentability and the growing interest in translational anatomical research. The records of granted patents were 747 and 487 patent applications, which are significant data for the growth of the culture of patentability as well as the quality of the patents, since those granted represent 60.40%. These results identify the strong growth of anatomical science and its interest in the transfer of scientific achievements. © 2023 Sociedad Anatomica Espanola. All rights reserved.

AB  - Open innovation is a concept of collaboration of ideas, knowledge, and resources that originates from within the organization and involves external organizations. University-industry collaboration is a factor driving innovation and competitiveness. Most research on interactions between universities and industry concentrated on the industrial side meanwhile, universities, as knowledge producers, play a vital role in creating an open innovation ecosystem that encourages realizing innovations that benefit society. Therefore, the problem raised in this research is how university collaboration can support open innovation. This research aims to identify research trends, the latest technologies, and inter-university collaboration frameworks that can support open innovation. The methodology used is Kitchenham's Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and bibliometric. SLR consists of Identification Study, Selection Studies, Quality Assessment, Data Extraction and Study Synthesis. From the SLR stages, 21 papers published between 2019 and 2023 were obtained. Synthesis and additional literature review were carried out to identify trends, technologies, and frameworks related to the topic comprehensively. In terms of trend, based on the application bibliometric, it was found that there was an increase in the number of publications and the top list of open innovation journals. University collaboration in open innovation more frequently takes place in the UK, and the industries mostly involved are small-medium enterprises. Quantitative research methodology and data analyses, comprising of hypothesis test, regression test, and descriptive statistics, are mostly preferred. Meanwhile, descriptive data analysis is the most common means of qualitative data analysis. Numerous suggestions on topics for future research were also identified. In addition, data analysis using machine learning survival data is identified as a novelty among data analysis methods. Technology transfer and the use of digital platforms may support open innovation processes, and the use of blockchain technology may promote digital platforms development. Seven domains form the framework for university collaboration in open innovation, namely Social Behavior, People, Process, Organization, Environment, Technology, and Performance. The findings of trends, technologies, and frameworks in this research may serve as a foundation for research on similar topics, and the identified framework domains could serve as framework components that might be used by universities to collaborate with partners in implementing open innovation processes. The research have contributes to knowledge management theoretically and practically. Theoretically, open innovation can expand the knowledge base by supporting the concept that knowledge and expertise can be found outside organizational boundaries. Practically, it can enrich knowledge management practices by emphasizing the importance of utilizing digital platform technology in supporting knowledge management sourced from external knowledge and collaboration services in the open innovation process. © 2024 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

AB  - Entrepreneurship as a career option plays a fundamental role in creating employment, productivity and economic growth. In this context, Entrepreneurial University" emerges in the universities, based on promoting entrepreneurship especially among its students. Taking into account the theory of planned behaviour, the purpose of this paper is to determine the direct relationship between psychological capital and entrepreneurial intention as a career option, and to analyse the mediating role of perceived behavioural control and subjective norms in this relation. On the basis of a literature review, an integrative model is proposed to explain the relationship between the studied variables. The results obtained show the mediating role played by perceived behavioural control and subjective norms in the relationship between psychological capital and entrepreneurial intention. Management education must take into account the development of programs that encourage or enhance psychological capital of students, since behaviours, thoughts and actions can be learned and developed in people. Additionally, programs developed at a political level and aimed at promoting entrepreneurship, can take into account this variable as a filter in the selection of people to participate in them © 2023

AB  - This article draws on research to evaluate the skills and traits required to be a successful music entrepreneur and Canadian musician in the face of digitalization. Theoretical and empirical studies emphasize entrepreneurship in every career. Researchers found that successful businessmen had unique skills that helped them achieve their goals faster. Creativity, timing, resource management, and opportunity awareness are connected to career success. This research explores academic entrepreneurs’ best practices. Entrepreneurship is varied; therefore, the study found comparable effects and distinct conflict causes. Comparing general commercial success determinants to the skills musicians need to succeed in Canada and abroad generated four surprising findings: 1. Musicians require entrepreneurial skills. Musicians need skills to succeed and make money. 2. To capitalize on music industry digitalization, Canadian artists must strengthen their business skills. 3. Canadian artists need digital distribution and copyright skills to succeed in the internet era. 4. Entrepreneurship may be taught. Empirical research shows that entrepreneurs can learn better via experience than didactic training. These findings should support earlier research and assist policymakers develop “industry-specific” entrepreneurship tools for Canadian music practitioners. © 2022, University of Arkansas Press.

AB  - Entrepreneurial higher education institutions (HEIs) have gained significant traction, both in theory and practice. The concept has evolved from academic entrepreneurship, which gained prominence in the 1990s, into a more comprehensive notion at institutional level and has been an influencing factor for governmental decisions and the region's economic development. This study seeks to present an overview of the evolution of entrepreneurial HEI research and provide a description of the structures characterizing it. This paper presents an in-depth examination and analysis of the current state of research and published literature related to entrepreneurial HEIs. A descriptive bibliometric analysis coupled with content analysis is presented, incorporating citations included in Scopus' multi-disciplinary database over the last 25 years. Two software packages—VOS viewer and Bibliometrix R were employed to probe the research questions and create visualizations of the bibliometric networks. Thematic mapping of the multifaceted research field is illustrated and emerging trends of are identified. Findings suggest that the research on entrepreneurial HEI has been pioneered by USA followed by UK and other European countries. Moreover, the research seems to be fragmented and more focused on only entrepreneurial universities. Future research needs to consider colleges and smaller institutions alongside larger universities. Also, further steps need to be undertaken to encourage and enable cross-border international collaboration, so as to draw learning together from different national and regional contexts. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Technology transfer has played an important role in promoting the development of technologies for green innovation around the world. The objective of the article was to develop a conceptual model of green technology transfer within the university-industry ambit. The methodological procedures were carried out in four distinct phases. The first phase consisted of a literature search regarding technology transfer conceptual models; this bibliographic review was performed using the ISI (Web of Science) platform, grounded on articles published over a period of 27 years from 1995 to 2022. The second search phase was based on the value chain. The third phase had as its objective to apply a questionnaire with open questions to several Brazilian universities. The last phase consisted in developing the conceptual model. From the results, it is possible to integrate the pre-development and post-transfer technology activities, and the process of green technology transfer can be carried out by focusing on the commercial results of technology licensing, including commercial advantages with a sustainable focus. Notwithstanding, the Brazilian government should create public policies aiming to stimulate the participation of companies in partnership with universities, allowing universities to help them by developing green technologies and patents. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Understanding the role of the factors that contribute to the development and growth of entrepreneurial universities is important for both the university itself and the global economy as a whole. Therefore, this study aimed to gain a deep understanding of the entrepreneurial university. The study was designed with a mixed-method approach in which quantitative and qualitative methods were used together. In the quantitative part of the mixed-method research, a systematic literature review of the entrepreneurial university concept was done and based on the results of the literature search obtained by quantitative methods, general concepts and categories and their relations with the contexts were revealed. In the qualitative part of the mixed-method research, in order to explain the entrepreneurial university understanding, semi-structured interviews were conducted with academicians in universities. According to the findings, it was found that conceptualization was very important to understand the entrepreneurial university. The university was considered as an institution that serves students and companies via some channels, such as research reports, an academic publication, or a patent received at the end of a project. As the entrepreneurial university paradigm is being studied by various institutions in the world, this study contributes to the literature both as a theoretical study and as a study that reveal the concepts of the entrepreneurial university. By providing a conceptual framework, the research will contribute to the literature as a theoretical study by aiming to explain the service systems (universities, government, firms) based on the exchange of skills and the creation of common value in the knowledge-based society on the entrepreneurial university paradigm, which is extremely popular in the world. Fındings from the systematic literature review and interviews with academicians were analysed comparatively, and a conceptual framework that evaluates the concepts and variables of the entrepreneurial university with a holistic view is presented. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Innovation capability contributes to the competitiveness of a country. However, due to the multi-faceted nature of this dynamic capability, its development is considered a risky task. Thus, it is critical to concentrate the efforts on the determinants that might provide a higher impact on sustaining the development of this capability, particularly for a developing country with limited resources. This work presents a systematic literature review examining 14 innovation determinants to advance the understanding of their impact on countries’ innovation capability. This research studied the literature by qualitative strategies to categorize and contextualize the findings. It also includes the contribution made by experts from a developing country through interviews. The selected publications and the interviews provided fundamental elements to identify the impact and linkages of the innovation determinants on the development of innovation capability. From here, a conceptual framework is outlined proposing an incremental loop that encompasses five stages: (1) government support, (2) implementation of innovation agencies, (3) R&D projects between U-I, (4) innovation clusters development, and (5) innovation output achievement. These stages systematize practical strategies regarding the 14 determinants posing a path to sustain the growth of this capability in the context of developing countries, contributing from theoretical and practical standpoints. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Vast sums of public money are invested into universities globally as anchor institutions and knowledge bases providing seedbed resources for research and development and entrepreneurship. Focusing on university science and technology research we examine two U.K. case studies of government support from the 'Innovation Knowledge Centre' (IKC) program to translate research into industry innovation for public good. Although IKCs are not tasked to address climate change, the two case studies demonstrate tremendous potential for Cleantech development. An exploratory entrepreneurial finance ('entfin') ecosystem theoretical lens contextualizes the catalytic roles of universities and public funding to support industry at the base of the innovation finance escalator. We thus develop university-industry ecosystems literature, addressing the gap in nurturing university entfin for climate change. Our qualitative case study methodology includes literature review and 51 key informant interviews with: policymakers; university research leaders, technology transfer officers, specialist research to industry innovation 'translation' staff, SME beneficiaries, trade bodies; and early-stage private finance providers. We reveal nuances in different emerging innovation sectors - notably their degree of maturity, locality, and outcome horizons for achieving impact, drawing attention to the key roles of universities and financing and their interactions within their entfin ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for government long horizon, deep pocket, investment, and integrated university entfin policy mix, alongside more open, inclusive, ecosystem development between different actors. © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past century a dramatic decline in sleep duration among adolescents, such as more than one hour of sleep loss per night, has been reported. A debt in sleep duration could lead to sleep deprivation, a major risk factor associated with daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness refers to the inability to maintain an adequate level of alertness during the day which may result in more or less being able to control falling asleep at inappropriate times. This literature review updates on sleepiness regarding its characteristics, etiology and consequences on adolescents. Studies revealed that from 25 % to 78 % of adolescents had reported sleepiness. Its manifestations may include heavy lids, yawns, difficulties to concentrate and emotional irritability. In addition, while it is recommended that adolescents under 18 years-old should sleep from eight to ten hours a night, only 63 % of them actually do so. The etiology of sleep deprivation and sleepiness in this population can be explained by various biological and societal factors. First, the sleep-wake cycle of adolescents shows a biological shift from the beginning of pubertal maturation, described as a perfect storm. It refers to a social jetlag by going to sleep and waking up later and accumulating a sleep debt during weekdays which they try to reimburse during weekends. This phenomenon can be explained by physiological changes such as a slower accumulation of sleep pressure. In addition to this perfect storm, environmental and societal factors contribute to the social jetlag and reduce sleep duration in adolescents. Screen exposure before bedtime can delay sleep and wake onset, which is a risk factor for sleeping debt. Substance use such as caffeine, cigarettes or electronic vaporizer, ADHD or freely available medication, alcohol, cannabis use or drug consumption could further disrupt sleep-wake cycle by stimulating, depressing or otherwise disrupting the central nervous system. Early, before 8:30 am, class start times have been associated with chronic sleep deprivation, higher level of sleepiness and delayed melatonin peak secretion. Adolescents working or doing extracurricular occupations for more than 20 hours a week are more at risk for reduced sleep duration and sleepiness. Parental supervision about sleep during the weekdays were associated with more appropriate bedtime. Adolescents from low socio-demographic characteristics and from minority ethnic groups have reported displaying a shorter sleep duration. Finally, sleep disorders of a physiological origin such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, may explain the sleep deprivation and sleepiness. Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents have consequences on their health. Cognitive functioning, such as problem solving, attention or memory, as well as school performance, can be compromised by sleep deprivation and sleepiness. At the psychological level, adolescents reporting sleepiness are more prone to display mental health problems: associations were found between sleepiness and subjective perception of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints as well as with antisocial behaviors. Finally, 68 % of 16 year-old adolescents reported they drove a car, and the reported sleepiness could lead to road accidents due to reduced attentional functioning, reaction time and decision-making abilities. In the United-States, from 7 % to 16.5 % of deadly accidents were related to driving while drowsy. Highlighting etiology and problems associated with sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents could guide researchers and clinicians towards the development of possible interventions. Public health measures and knowledge transfer programs regarding modifiable psychosocial and societal factors associated with sleep-wake bioregulation could increase awareness in parents as well as in political and societal decision makers. © 2022 L'Encéphale, Paris

AB  - This article provides a critical literature review on the regional determinants of environmental innovation. The analysis of the relevant literature on supply-side factors, demand-side factors, and institutional factors reveals the importance of regional determinants in green technology development. Specifically, regional R&D collaborations, university-industry collaborations, and technological relatedness have positive effects on innovation activities in green domains. On the demand side, regional environmental awareness and demonstration effects play a pivotal role in the emergence and diffusion of environmental innovations. Environmental regulations also induce environmental innovation, however, there is only limited evidence at the regional level. Our literature review has informed the development of an agenda for future research, which suggests three avenues for further investigation. Firstly, we recommend abandoning the simple green vs. non-green dichotomy and conducting more technology-sensitive studies on the determinants of environmental innovation. Secondly, we call for a more sophisticated and critical engagement with regional institutions, with a focus on both formal and informal institutions. Lastly, we propose a demand-side turn in research on the regional determinants of environmental innovation in order to better understand their diffusion across space. Overall, our findings suggest that policymakers need to adopt a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to eco-innovation policy, one that considers the spatial and multi-level governance challenges and promotes inclusive regional development. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Over the last few decades, a wide range of works have featured studies documenting successful pedagogic collaborations in the form of university-industry partnerships in engineering education. In light of this, we conducted a systematic literature review of these studies centred around five key research questions: (a) purposes of university-industry collaborations, (b) theories used to guide such work, (c) types of methods employed, (d) evidence-based best practices identified and (e) areas of future work to be explored. Publications were selected for inclusion by screening and appraising results obtained from databases and keywords refined through a scoping study. We conclude from our findings that future studies would benefit from better alignment with literature or theoretical frameworks and specific robust methods. Additionally, early and middle years of undergraduate engineering programs offer underutilised opportunities for partnership, in line with designing a more futures-focused educational curriculum. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - University-industry collaboration (UIC) projects are complex undertakings, that can involve multiple parties or stakeholders. Effective management of UICs can mean the difference between success and failure, in terms of technology transfer and research commercialization. This research paper focuses on the micro-level analysis of UICs and in particular the project management practices that can help major UICs deliver benefits and broader societal impact. PM has been evolving toward more hybrid approaches involving both traditional and agile practices. A conceptualization of a hybrid approach is presented based on a literature review. This conceptualization is then used as a starting point for exploratory empirical research. Participant observation, document analysis, and thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted in a large UIC case study to help identify PM practices and check their relevance. Data analysis led to a framework comprising 29 transversal or must-have practices distributed throughout the project lifecycle and 30 contingent or optional practices, divided into traditional, agile and common. This research extends the existing knowledge on UICs by giving a micro-level perspective on managing UIC projects and providing evidence of the adoption of hybrid approaches to assure the overall governance of significant inter-organizational endeavors. The framework provides a roadmap for future major UIC projects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The research aimed to determine the best components of Malaysia-Counsellor Performance Indicator in measuring the counsellor's performance in Malaysia. This is the first development phase of the MCPI. This study involved two types of research designs; quantitative and qualitative approaches (Mixed Method). The quantitative data has been obtained from 102 respondents and interview with eight (8) counsellors from different settings. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to select the respondent and proportional stratification was used to determine the sample size of each stratum. A Need Assessment questionnaire has been developed by the researchers as well as the protocol interview. These two instruments were developed based on the literature reviews of previous instruments that have been invented from the Western perspective to measure the performance and competency of counsellors. The results of the study were analysed using descriptive analysis and thematic analysis. Findings have shown that the majority of counsellors possessed knowledge and skills in conducting counselling sessions. Most counsellors in the study demonstrated good interpersonal relationships, interaction, multicultural and religiosity and ethics and professionalism. Through this study, to measure the performance of counsellors, the researchers have found that they must equip themselves with knowledge, skill, interpersonal relationship, interaction, multicultural and religiosity and ethics and professionalism aspects. Based on the interview data, there were new components that have been identified to be added to the Malaysia Counsellor Performance Indicator (M-CPI) which include knowledge (theoretical and knowledge transfer), skills (case management, practical skills and academic/professional writing), interpersonal relationship and interaction, cultural and religiosity, professional roles and expertise, ethics and legality, attitudes and personality, referral and articulate philosophy of the profession. In future, research should also focus on the validity and reliability of the components listed in the M-CPI. © Iran University of Science and Technology 2023.

AB  - Family businesses represent the most widespread entrepreneurial form. Within knowledge management studies, a large amount of research has focused on family businesses, highlighting the particular needs they require. At the same time, several studies have highlighted the existence of barriers and enabling factors in the adoption of new technologies within family businesses. Currently, we are seeing the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) within business organizations. On these premises, this study has a dual objective. The first objective, from a theoretical point of view, wants to trace the link between AI and knowledge management. The second objective of this study aims to identify the main barriers to the application of AI in family businesses. This study is based on a systematic literature review using the phases of data collection, bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Two international scientific databases were used: Scopus and Web of Science (Clarivate). A search string was created by identifying keywords. Subsequently, only scientific documents published in double blind review journals, in English, were selected. The sample used in this study contained about 40 scientific documents. The results of this study offer initial reflections on the adoption of artificial intelligence in family businesses. Artificial intelligence represents a new way of managing knowledge within organizations. The peculiar characteristics of family businesses impose reflections on the methods of adoption and barriers that may emerge. This study contributes to the understanding of family businesses, under the theoretical perspective of knowledge management. Family businesses represent complex but widespread organizations. For this reason, academics, entrepreneurs and practitioners must understand the obstacles that could make the adoption of AI difficult. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital transformation (DT) has changed the means and mechanisms for acquiring knowledge, meaning that higher education institutions (HEI) have changed the form of student-lecturer and teaching‐learning interaction. Digital transformation must have a relevant role in building the hard skills (HS) necessary for academic entrepreneurship, where HS are easily taught and measured. This study analyses the basis of HS for digital academic entrepreneurship, answering the following research hypothesis: What are the hard skills—entrepreneurial education—for digital academic entrepreneurship and how are they formed? An extensive, inclusive literature review revealed that, due to the possibility of editing, reprogramming and generating digital technology, the basis of DT can support the development of HS in higher education students. The results show that HS can be developed considering three major pillars: (i) Management Tools, (ii) Digital Process, and (iii) Digital Products. Since HS are easily taught, this study shows how the use of digital technology can transform this scalable teaching process in order to reach the maximum number of students. It is therefore suggested that those in charge of HEIs use the pillars presented here in the framework proposed to guide their institutions’ strategic planning. With these pillars in mind, the aim is to stimulate the development of innovative business proposals developed in the academic environment and promote digital academic entrepreneurship. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - For decades, Fuzzy Sets Theory (FST) has been consistently developed, and its use has spread across multiple disciplines. In this process of knowledge transfer, fuzzy applications have experienced great diffusion. Among them, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (fuzzy AHP) is one of the most widely used methodologies today. This study performs a systematic review following the PRISMA statement and addresses a bibliometric analysis of all articles published on fuzzy AHP in journals indexed in Web of Science, specifically in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). The analyzed database includes 2086 articles published between 1994 and 2022. The results show the thematic clusters, the evolution of the academic conversation and the main collaboration networks. The main contribution of this article is to clarify the research agenda on fuzzy AHP. The results of the study allow academics to detect publication opportunities. In addition, the evidence found allows researchers and academics setting the field’s agenda to advise the editors of high-impact journals on gaps and new research trends. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The research literature on university–private partnerships shows that these partnerships can contribute significantly to the building of a knowledge-based economy. At the heart of this contribution is the practice of knowledge transfer. Through the analytical lens of social capital theory, this paper reports on a systematic review of 23 studies, from 2000 to 2021, on partnerships between universities and private sector organisations. The findings reveal inconsistencies in knowledge transfer, especially from the perspective of the cognitive frame of this theory. Based on these findings, a more rigorous theoretical framework is proposed for the enhancement of knowledge transfer in such partnerships, as moderated by the intermediary factor, and future research directions are suggested. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Universities play an essential role in preparing human resources for the industry of the future. By providing the proper knowledge, they can ensure that graduates will be able to adapt to the ever-changing industrial sector. However, to achieve this, the courses provided by academia must cover the current and future industrial needs by considering the trends in scientific research and emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Edge Computing (EC). This work presents the survey results conducted among academics to assess the current state of university courses, regarding the level of knowledge and skills provided to students about the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Edge Computing. The novelty of the work is that (a) the research was carried out in several European countries, (b) the current curricula of universities from different countries were analyzed, and (c) the results present the teachers’ perspective. To conduct the research, the analysis of the relevant literature took place initially to explore the issues of the presented subject, which will increasingly concern the industry in the near future. Based on the literature review results and analysis of the universities’ curricula involved in this study, a questionnaire was prepared and shared with academics. The outcomes of the analysis reveal the areas that require more attention from scholars and possibly modernization of curricula. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose: Digital technology changes the organizational structure of traditional firms, creating opportunities for entrepreneurship. These modifications are known as “digital transformation” (DT). In addition, higher education institutions (HEIs) are altering the form of student–lecturer and teaching–learning interaction, where DT restructures the bases of soft skills (SS). Since SS are difficult to measure, this study aims to analyze the bases of SS for digital academic entrepreneurship, responding to the following research question: What are the bases of digital academic entrepreneurship and how are they formed? Design/methodology/approach: An extensive integrative review of the literature revealed that due to the editable, re-combinable, reprogrammable and generating nature of digital technology, the basis of DT, it is necessary to develop SS in higher education students. Findings: The results show that the competencies can be developed considering three major groupings: (1) individual characteristics, (2) cultural characteristics and (3) knowledge sharing. Practical implications: Since SS are not easily taught, this study shows how the use of digital tools can help and support this type of process. It is suggested, therefore, that those in charge of HEIs should use the pillars presented in the framework proposed here to guide their institutions' strategic planning. With these pillars in mind, the aim is to stimulate an entrepreneurial mentality in students and develop digital academic entrepreneurship. Originality/value: An innovative conceptual model of digital academic entrepreneurship is proposed from the perspective of SS, where the interlinking of those groupings is permeated by DT, as well as the disruptive role of digital technology, leading to the development of an entrepreneurial mentality in HEI students. © 2022, Ana Garcez, Mário Franco and Ricardo Silva.

AB  - This study investigates the pivotal factors influencing intergenerational knowledge transfer within the academic environment of Iranian universities, with a focused case study on the administrative staff of Allameh Tabataba'i University. Employing a dual-phase research process, the first phase involves an indepth literature review and the application of the Delphi method to distill expert opinions, culminating in the identification of key knowledge transfer factors, and the development of a comprehensive questionnaire. The subsequent phase entails the distribution of this questionnaire among the administrative staff, resulting in the collection and analysis of 261 responses through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis tests. Significantly, the study unveils a nuanced classification of knowledge transfer factors into four distinct categories: knowledge characteristics, individual attributes, interpersonal dynamics, and contextual influences. Beyond mere classification, the research identifies specific items wielding the most substantial impact on intergenerational knowledge transfer. © 2023, Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article addresses the following research question: does the entrepreneurial orientation of a university influence the entrepreneurial propensity of its academics? To answer this question, the authors conducted a two-phase study. First, based on a literature review of the entrepreneurial university and Nelles and Vorley’s theoretical framework on entrepreneurial architecture, they developed a conceptual model and research instrument to assess academics’ perceptions of the characteristics most likely attributed to the entrepreneurial university and their effects on an academic’s entrepreneurial propensity. Second, the authors used the research instrument to conduct a pilot study of the effect of a Canadian university’s entrepreneurial orientation on its academics’ entrepreneurial propensity. The pilot study, using the proposed methodology with detailed accounts of collecting, analyzing and interpreting the data, suggests that the proposed methodology is appropriate for measuring the relationship alluded to in the research question. Furthermore, the methodology can help university leadership in designing possible interventions to correct identified deficiencies in the university’s entrepreneurial architecture to stimulate academic entrepreneurship on campus. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - A central theme in the literature has been the identification of the factors that drive the creation of entrepreneurial universities. The application of these factors and university institutional commitment become essential to overcome the institutional barriers that may exist. Moreover, some authors have warned that in some university systems, transformation becomes a challenge due to high dependence on the State. In this paper, we have examined whether the dependence of Spanish universities on the State can be interpreted as an inhibitor of the transformation process, as well as the institutional commitment of several universities to become entrepreneurial entities, in a national framework that - considering the literature - would not seem the most optimal to achieve it. We note that the State is not an inhibitor, but not all universities show the same internal commitment. When universities are committed to change, the process is accelerated by the sum of two impulses.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This conceptual paper identifies how municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is currently being practiced in developing economies from an institutional perspective. Semi-systematic review of 934 peer-reviewed journal articles extracted from the Web of Science database is used as the foundation for this paper. The findings affirm that the current MSWM practices of most developing economies are either ineffective, inefficient, or limited. Hence, they are contributing to environmental, social, and economic negative impacts that can impede sustainable development. Though the literature highlights several remedies that could curtail the negative impacts of current MSWM practices, most developing economies are yet to engage with these due to numerous constraints. Special emphasis is on administrative constraints (or the norms, expectations, and requirements within the specific institutional field where MSWM is practiced in developing economies) that prevents adoption of new MSWM practices in developing economies. In this context, social movements can play a critical role in improving current MSWM practices. This paper makes recommendations for a way forward in which social movements could act as institutional entrepreneurs to change the norms, expectations, and requirements of the institutional field for a sustainable MSWM in developing economies. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This research study focuses on fostering a transformative journey from knowledge to innovation among students by enhancing their research experiences. The process involves converting initial conceptual ideas into tangible projects, which are subsequently developed into design patents, culminating in the creation of market-ready products. The study draws inspiration from the exploration of the critical radius of insulation, undertaken during the sixth semester of a mechanical engineering undergraduate program. This concept was practically applied to mitigate heat losses in household pressure cookers. Notably, a gap in the availability of such products in the Indian market was identified through extensive literature review, leading to the student’s engagement in this project. Encouraged by their mentors, the students presented their innovation to the university innovation, incubation, and research center, successfully obtaining financial backing. This paper comprehensively recounts the entirety of the student’s research journey. It commences with the translation of theoretical curriculum knowledge into actionable research ideas. The subsequent phases encompass various research methodologies, including theoretical analysis and simulation studies. The journey progresses with the execution of experimental approaches, effectively translating findings into design patents and, ultimately, tangible market-ready products. Overall, this research emphasizes the crucial role of research experiences in bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application. It underscores the significance of nurturing student’s innovative capabilities within the structured curriculum, contributing to their holistic development as future contributors to academia and industry alike. © 2024, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

AB  - Evidence-informed decision-making is increasingly recognized as a standard for policymaking in many fields, including public health. However, many challenges exist in identifying the appropriate evidence, disseminating it to different stakeholders, and implementing it in various settings. The Israel Implementation Science and Policy Engagement Centre (IS-PEC) was established at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev to “bridge the gap” between scientific research and policy. As an illustrative case study, IS-PEC is conducting a scoping review on strategies to engage senior citizens in Israel when developing health policy. In May 2022, IS-PEC brought together international experts and Israeli stakeholders to increase knowledge in the field of evidence-informed policy, develop a research agenda, strengthen international collaborations, and create a community for sharing experience, research, and best practices. Panelists presented the importance of communicating clear, accurate bottom-line messages with the media. Also, they highlighted the once-in-a-generation opportunity to promote the uptake of evidence in public health due to the increased public interest in evidence-informed policymaking post-COVID-19 pandemic and the need to build systems and centers to support the systematic use of evidence. Group discussions focused on various aspects of communication, including challenges and strategies when communicating to policymakers, understanding the nuances of communication between scientists, journalists, and the public, and some ethical issues surrounding data visualization and infographics. Panelists participated in a passionate debate regarding whether and how values play a role when conducting, analyzing, and communicating evidence. Takeaway lessons from the workshop included that going forward, Israel must create lasting systems and a sustainable environment for evidence-informed policy. Novel and interdisciplinary academic programs must be developed to train future policymakers in various fields, including public health, public policy, ethics, communication, social marketing, and infographics. Sustainable professional relationships between journalists, scientists, and policymakers must be fostered and strengthened based on mutual respect and a shared commitment to creating, synthesizing, implementing, and communicating high-quality evidence to serve the public and individual wellbeing. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The interaction of the university and its context determines the policies to ensure that research and development (R+D) have a positive impact on society. However, innovation and entrepreneurship (I+E) have been generating new scenarios and policies in the university. The aim of this study is to identify models for R+D+i+e interaction between the university and its context. In this research, a systematic mapping study (SMS) was performed in five digital libraries. In the process, 13,561 articles were obtained and 336 articles selected as primary studies. In the literature, 17 interaction models for R+D+i+e interaction between the university and its context were identified. The most reported models are: Industrial University, Triple Helix, Entrepreneurial University, Open Innovation and Stakeholders. Likewise, the main types of activities linked to the identified models are: research, innovation and the combination of research and development. In contrast, there are few for experimental development and entrepreneurship. © 2024 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an urgent need for all industries to go beyond the existing set of policies against greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to combat climate change. As the major producer (19%) of GHG, the construction industry needs to optimise its carbon footprint (CF) decision-making processes to provide better management solutions against global warming. Identification and evaluation of the key factors that affect CF decision-making are critical yet limited. Based on our knowledge, no existing study compares the different characteristics of construction projects’ CF management approaches through the whole life cycle phases (including assessment, optimisation, and comparison) to enable CF-related knowledge transfer between the building and infrastructure sectors. To meet these knowledge gaps, this paper reviewed 1,465 studies related to infrastructure and building CF projects and selected 31 studies to evaluate academic researchers’ contributions toward the different CF decision-making stages for the building and infrastructure projects’ whole lifecycle. The paper systematically reviewed and assessed the existing information in five key CF decision-making stages: project drafting stage, methodology choosing stage, data collection stage, CF analysis stage, and CF visualisation stage. A generalised CF decision-making framework is also developed to inform future CF management. The limitations of the existing studies and the benefits of the developed framework were summarised. This study identifies the key information required from the perspective of CF management decision-makers and contributes a universal CF decision-making framework for state-of-the-art CF management practice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With e-learning rapidly gaining popularity, evaluating its effectiveness and efficiency has become a challenge in public education, the public sector, and the corporate sector. Measuring knowledge transfer is crucial in any learning process, but e-learning lacks validated methods for this. Here we examine ways to evaluate that particularly in case of e-learning, conducting a literature review to assess available measurement solutions, developing an evaluation method for knowledge transfer, and validating the method. Using logged data from e-courses, it is possible to assess the knowledge transfer in e-learning. We describe a novel method for classifying effectiveness and efficiency with measured values and measurement instruments. The new measurement method was aligned with a data set of an existing learning management system, and the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer was analysed using quantitative means, including descriptive statistics, regression modelling, and cluster analysis based on a specific e-learning course. This newly elaborated and validated knowledge transfer measurement technique could be a useful tool for anyone wanting to evaluate e-learning courses and can also serve as a baseline for academics to further develop or implement it on larger empirical datasets. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - In the knowledge society, universities are asked to contribute to regional development and economic growth through the direct exploitation of research products and, indirectly, through enhancing entrepreneurial awareness in students. Student entrepreneurship (SE) gained increasing relevance among scholars that suggest more research is needed and identify student entrepreneurship as an emerging and growing phenomenon. In this paper, we present the results of a systematization of the current literature to define the state of the art and identify possible new research directions, analyzing 288 published articles in the main International Entrepreneurship and Management Journals and the main journals in Education and Management Business Accounting subject area. The results are presented in two macro sections. The first one is related to the corpus overview and bibliometrics which explores articles by evolution on time, author, citation analysis, and journals. The second section will involve a content analysis that highlights the main issues that emerge from the analysis of the papers, such as the most frequently used theories, data gathering methodologies and methods and mechanisms adopted by universities to support and promote SE. We are confident that these topic areas will significantly help any researcher approaching the study of SE by offering an overview of the different sub-fields in this area. Our work offers suggestions to management educators and business schools administrators to identify new ways to support student entrepreneurs by enhancing their entrepreneurial activities, and institutional leader to rethink policies that encourage entrepreneurship among students. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Patenting and technology commercialization activities are rapidly gaining momentum in Indian academia. Currently, there is paucity of data suggesting technology commercialization activities among Indian academia. This study aims to examine issues regarding technology commercialization among Indian academics. The objectives of this study are to (1) understand the policy implications of university-industry technology transfer and (2) propose a conceptual model for technology transfer suitable for Indian scenario. The data included for our analysis is drawn from our previous study of 25 Indian Universities. The orientation of the paper is as follows: “Literature Review” is subdivided into two sub-sections — “Policies Implemented for Leveraging Successful Academic Research Commercialization in the USA, Japan, and Israel” and “University Research Commercialization — Case Studies of Universities in the USA, Japan, and Israel” are presented. “Methodology” deals with the methodology used for the study. “Discussion” is further subdivided into three sections — “Analysis and Comparisons of Policy Implications on University-Industry Technology Transfer,” “Practice of Academic Technology Transfer in Indian Universities/Institutes,” and “Conceptual Model Recommended for University-Industry Tech Commercialization in India.” “Conclusion” concludes the topic. The current practices of academia-industry knowledge commercialization in India are limited, and the paper is an attempt to propose a suitable model to encourage commercialization activities by Indian universities. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper aims to explore and analyse the impact of organisational factors on the outcome of the university-industry collaboration towards competitive advantages. Based on an extensive literature review and initial qualitative research, a theoretical framework is constructed with six antecedents (commitment, trust, communication, management mechanism, reputation and understanding) of the outcome and its relationship with a competitive advantage as its consequence. A structural equation model (PLS-SEM) is then used for an empirical analysis of 240 responses to a survey of people in business involved in university-industry relationships. Findings show that four factors had a significant positive impact on the outcome of collaborative relationships, among which the management mechanism was the most important of the results in the collaboration. Additionally, the higher the outcome of university-industry collaboration, the greater the competitive advantages. The paper concludes with recommendations and directions for future research. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Research on mountain ecosystem services (MES) under the influence of climate change and human activities has gradually become the focus of academic attention in recent years. Here, this study analyzes the research hotspots and frontiers of this field based on metrics including main research forces, core journals and papers, research hotspots and topics by using the methods of bibliometrics and text mining. The results revealed the following: (1) the number of papers is increasing rapidly in recent years. From 2015 to 2019, 929 papers were published, with an average of 185 papers per year. But the average cited times of those papers is declining, dropped from 6.01 in 2016 to 4.2 in 2019. The USA, UK, and China rank the top three of the number of papers. Univ Maryland, Univ Oxford and Univ Wisconsin have the greatest influence, with an average of more than 77 citations per paper; (2) The most cited journals are PNAS, WETLANDS, ECOLOGY, AND SOCIETY, which are cited 191.54, 53.91, and 40.00 respectively. Most papers were published in OA journals including SUSTAINABILITY, WATER, Forests since 2017. Ten core papers undertaking knowledge transfer in this field have been identified; (3) analysis of the keywords found a new trend of integration of natural science and humanities. In two development stages of 2000–2014 and 2015–2019, the research hotspots mainly focused on mountain water resources, forest resources, land resources and the impact of climate change and human activities, and there are obvious differences and characteristics in different stages. The hotspot worthy of attention in the near future is the assessment of mountain ecosystem services capacity and value. This is the first comprehensive visualization and analysis of the research hotspots and trends of mountain ecosystem services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to examine the role of information and communication technology (ICT)-based communication technologies to create a sustainable recovery strategy through Build Back Better practice in the existing policy framework of Bangladesh. Its purpose is to analyse the problems associated with the current recovery process of the country and how the ICT-based communication technology can improve the situation. Nevertheless, the aim also extends towards the limitation of the technology and the infrastructures and possible adjustments in this regard. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the aim, the study conducted an extensive literature review of numerous grey literature, policy papers and scientific/academic articles in an exploratory approach. Findings: The result shows that the disaster recovery process of Bangladesh is slow, and there are some mismanagements (the lengthy risk assessment using ancient data generation processes, lack of accessibility and report-based data product) which was a cause behind the massive destruction done by recent cyclones. The ICT-based methods (proper database, many to many communications, GIS) can make this response faster, transparent and easy to access. Research limitations/implications: The research results may lack generalizability due to the research approach of the study. Thus, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: The study includes some possible adjustments to the argument for the existing policy infrastructure and scope of communication technology to bridge the theory and practice. Social implications: The study also includes some suggestions to engage society in disaster recovery processes. Originality/value: This paper urges to study the implication of technology in terms of disaster recovery on a broad scale. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Literature on the entrepreneurial university concept prominently lacks interaction with entrepreneurship education literature. Despite the apparent beneficial connections between (1) educating students encompassing entrepreneurial competencies and (2) the institutional framing of the entrepreneurial university concept, the latter has predominantly found its raison d'être in institutional theories and not pedagogical ones. Influential scholars such as Alan Gibb and Paul Hannon early articulated the benefits of tying entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial university literature together. This article positions the entrepreneurial university as an 'emergent pedagogical space' where the typology can find new relevance in educational theories of pedagogy and didactics. Based on an integrative review, the article discerns the disconnect between the two literature streams. It suggests an updated framework in which entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial university activities are closely linked to benefit higher education management, educators, and regional ecosystems.  © 2025.

AB  - Along with the development of large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, many existing approaches and tools for software security are changing. It is, therefore, essential to understand how security-aware these models are and how these models impact software security practices and education. In exercises of a software security course at our university, we ask students to identify and fix vulnerabilities we insert in a web application using state-of-the-art tools. After ChatGPT, especially the GPT-4 version of the model, we want to know how the students can possibly use ChatGPT to complete the exercise tasks. We input the vulnerable code to ChatGPT and measure its accuracy in vulnerability identification and fixing. In addition, we investigated whether ChatGPT can provide a proper source of information to support its outputs. Results show that ChatGPT can identify 20 of the 28 vulnerabilities we inserted in the web application in a white-box setting, reported three false positives, and found four extra vulnerabilities beyond the ones we inserted. ChatGPT makes nine satisfactory penetration testing and fixing recommendations for the ten vulnerabilities we want students to fix and can often point to related sources of information.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Preparing future graduates for the workplace should involve linkage with industry. Ultimately, students gain valuable insight into real-life projects, preparing them for future careers. However, universities in some developing countries lag in their initiatives to promote industry-academia collaboration. In this paper, we explore how to strengthen academic efforts at the University of Namibia (UNAM) with the assistance of industry in Namibia. In the study, we analyse: 1) current practices of industry collaboration worldwide published in ACM and IEEE digital library through a scoping review, and 2) students' capstone projects conducted in the final year of the Bachelor of Science (Honors) in the computing discipline in 2020 - 2022 at UNAM. The analysis from the scoping review found six (6) different University-Industry Collaboration initiatives employed in universities worldwide. Additionally, the review of current students' theses indicates that they are not aligned with all four key industries in Namibia: Mining, Tourism, Fisheries, and Agriculture. Hence, we contextualised the analysis by reflecting upon the economic drivers and demands of the country. The preliminary outcomes of this study allowed us to propose the incorporation of the Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate model in the computing degree programme that UNAM can adopt in developing an effective curriculum that aligns with the demands of the key relevant industries in Namibia. The aim is to support the development of new talent that will promote the country's economic growth. Reflecting on this process can also benefit other universities in developing countries by assisting them in contextualising their curricula and addressing their local and national requirements. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Both the transformation from innovation systems to innovation ecosystems and university reforms in such a context require a renewed understanding of the nature of universities and their roles in society. While the recent flourishing concepts about new models of universities suggest that the notion of an entrepreneurial university needs to be replaced by a more suitable concept to capture the unprecedented changes in universities in the societal transformation, the features of a new model of university described by these concepts can hardly fit into a consistent framework. This paper responds to this research gap by integrating both conceptual and empirical literature about the transformations or reforms of universities, mainly in the European context. Our major research findings are as follows. First, we identified characteristics of an ideal-type university in innovation ecosystems, named a sustainable entrepreneurial university (SEU), in comparison with those of an entrepreneurial university. Second, we elaborated on three emerging roles of the SEU in innovation ecosystems. Third, we found that while a transition from entrepreneurial universities to SEUs can be seen in European university reforms, the paces of the transformations vary. At the end of the paper, we discuss the scholarly and policy implications of our research findings. © 2021, International Association of Universities.

AB  - Promoting and encouraging university-industry collaboration is critical for skills development and exposure of graduates to the industry. This article examined the importance of fostering university-industry collaboration, using the Tshwane University of Technology 2018 and 2019 Arts Festivals as a case study. A qualitative research method was adopted to yield trustworthy findings that used approaches such as unstructured interviews and a literature review. The findings demonstrated that the inaugural Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) Arts Festival was necessary for collaboration and exposure of graduates to the industry. The article also revealed that the TUT Arts Festivals are considered a potential transformation platform where students exhibit their innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship and where teaching and learning is fostered. The article concluded by recommending that the organising team extend the TUT Arts Festivals’ duration to allow students and other participants to have adequate time to develop quality networking and university-industry collaborations. © 2023 Typology of Social Media Platform.

AB  - In the field of evidence-based management, the academic-practice gap is well-known and undermines the transfer of scientific findings to evidence-based decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the practical approach of community augmented meta-analysis (CAMA) that serves to ease cumulative evidence formation and dissemination in psychology. CAMA rests on the conviction that a better and faster knowledge transfer requires an increase in the efficiency and quality of evidence integration, timely publication of results, and a broad and easy accessibility. As a potential solution, we describe the platform PsychOpen CAMA that enables the publication of and access to meta-analytic data. We conclude with an empirical example that describes the implementation and presentation of a meta-analysis on gender differences in the intention to start a business using PsychOpen CAMA. Finally, we discuss benefits and potentials of the publication of meta-analytic data on the platform, as well as current methodological and technical limitations. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Young children are fundamental elements of societal progress. Consequently, cultivating adeptness in early childhood education and childcare talents assumes paramount significance, with educators within tertiary colleges and universities taking a pivotal role therein. Furthermore, research literacy is what educators develop through applying theoretical knowledge and is deemed an indispensable competency in effective instruction. This proficiency is manifested in formulating superlative curricula and augmenting scholastic prospects for students. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to analyze the global academic progression within the domain of early childhood education across Taiwanese tertiary institutions from 2012 to 2022. Employing the content analysis toolkit for academic research technology, the investigation discloses three focal points of research interest: children’s health, preschool curriculum design, and the professional competence of preschool educators. The inquiry discerns that personnel within Taiwan’s higher education sphere have evinced remarkable research scholarly proficiency in early childhood education. This not only bolsters Taiwan’s international scholarly standing but also emboldens nascent researchers to undertake more profound explorations within this academic arena, thereby amplifying Taiwan’s global academic influence in early childhood education. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

AB  - The Covid-19 epidemic is a global challenge requiring adequate public and private responses to overcome the emergency, shape new development trajectories, and prepare for future outbreaks. As socioeconomic turning points, epidemics imply an entrepreneurial response in which not only managers and entrepreneurs, but also policymakers, health professionals, and civil society as a whole are active participants. Using the PRISMA methodology, we provide a comprehensive review of the complex interactions between entrepreneurship and epidemics over time. Applying a combined Kirznerian-Schumpeterian theoretical framework, we find that, in the short term, epidemics trigger a wave of Kirznerian entrepreneurship aimed at reducing the uncertainty generated directly and indirectly by the medical emergency. In the long term, as medical uncertainty abates, Schumpeterian entrepreneurship can contribute to transforming the post-crisis environment, either supporting or undermining the public reaction to the crisis and determining the path of institutionalization, in the process of defining a new normal. Thus, epidemics could lead to unpredictable socioeconomic and technological improvements, but also to highly undesirable outcomes. The construction of a satisfactory new normal requires the integration of entrepreneurial capabilities within the public sector and an explicit policy of cooperation with the private sector. Therefore, as the short-term phase of the Covid-19 pandemic draws to a close, policymakers must shift their focus away from restrictions and obligations towards a collaborative framework supportive of private entrepreneurial efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Agricultural Extension is vital for sustainable farming development and food systems. During the past decades, several agricultural extension modelshave been implemented in India. The present study emphasises on the scientific contribution of agricultural extension researchduring the last decade (2011-2020). Bibliometric techniques have been employed to the secondary data for analysing 145 articles to identify relevant themes, collaboration patterns, topics under study and major journals for publication. It was observed that the research on agricultural extension has been increasing in recent years. The journals that have published the articles have highlighted multi-disciplinary research to address the challenges of the discipline. The central thematic area of research in the domain was new extension methodologies for technology transfer,applying information and communication technologies (ICTs) in farming and climate-change based research in extension. Probably, this might be the first bibliometric study to offer exhaustive information on extension research in India. The findings of the study will aid academics and decision-makers in formulating plans and strategies for better extension approaches for agricultural development. Agricultural extension practitioners may also use those findings for reorienting advisory services at the grassroots level. © 2023, Defense Scientific Information and Documentation Centre.

AB  - Industrial sectors’ innovative and sustainable development relies not only on solid government, society, academia, and industry but also on how they interact to set and implement strategic goals. In the fashion industry context, the new sociocultural scenario is increasingly driven by pressures from stakeholders to limit the impacts of industrial practices and to move toward new open ecosystems to create and maintain sustainable innovation. This article explores how such innovation can be enabled by design-driven actions in the context of the quadruple helix. Such a model aims to revitalize the areas of technological innovation and gradually advance the construction of the infrastructure needed for sustainable fashion growth, combining and integrating different knowledge. An initial literature review, complemented by case studies analysis, identifies the European fashion industry dynamics of innovation and the roles of industry, government, university, and society. In particular, the government is transforming from a mere controller to a facilitator of innovation synergies. Society relies on citizens revising their consumption habits by shifting toward a performative economy. Industry understands the need for collaboration and adopts new closed-loop supply chains to create and maintain its sustainable development. Universities enable new open system flows to make innovations concerning knowledge, technologies, and systems thrive, from technology transfer to knowledge co-creation. Based on the analysis, we propose a conceptual framework to understand the micro- and macro-dynamics of open innovation with a quadruple helix model to implement sustainability practices in the fashion sector through design-driven actions—reuse, repair, recycle, and refashion—that aim to eliminate the concept of waste to support local ecosystems toward establishing a closed-loop chain. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: As the main factor for sustainable development of countries, entrepreneurship is a difficult path only chosen by those who have a high level of risk-taking. On this path, entrepreneurship requires an ecosystem that welcomes this type of thinking and eliminates the barriers on the path as much as possible. This ecosystem comprises various components that attempt to pave the way in a private and public manner. The entrepreneurial ecosystem still has many latent aspects after several years. This study aims to provide a big picture of all studies published in the Web of Science database to help future researchers. Design/methodology/approach: In this research, 765 scientific papers published in the database were analyzed using 3 main approaches of network analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords and co-citation clustering. Findings: In the end, four major clusters were identified for articles in this field in the clustering section, including the entrepreneurial ecosystem, academic entrepreneurship, innovation ecosystem and institutional entrepreneurship. Originality/value: This paper used a new approach for reviewing the entrepreneurial ecosystem and made a big picture of all previous research studies. In the end, an unsupervised machine learning approach was used to clustering the research studies and four major clusters were identified. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper focuses on university-industry relationships, and the value in such linkages that motivates firms to choose a particular mode to acquire university-generated research output. We combined insights from literature review and 15 exploratory interviews of multiple stakeholders, and developed a framework to examine university-industry linkages. We grounded our framework on the social exchange theory (SET) and quadruple helix concept. It proposes university climate readiness (e.g. incentive system), firm climate readiness (e.g. managers' attitude toward academic research), and exchange readiness (e.g. a firm's absorptive capacity) as antecedents to science-business collaboration, coupled with environmental readiness factors (e.g. unique socio-cultural setting in developing economies) as moderating variables. The framework highlights (1) functional value (i.e. technology pricing, quality, and applicability) and (2) relational value (i.e. trust between academia and industry) in the said relationship. The framework further provides a basis for practitioners to arrive at a suitable university-developed technology transfer mode (e.g. patent licensing, research services, and research partnerships).  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Firms with the assets complementary to Artificial Intelligence (AI) have actively conducted AI research and selectively published their results since AI has resurged around 2006. Focusing on the recent AI development, we investigate how and to what extent firms’ deep engagement in the publication of emerging science-related technology can influence the evolution of published knowledge. Using bibliometric analyses applied to the papers in major AI conferences and journals, we find that papers with at least one author affiliated to a firm, and particularly papers with only firm-affiliated author(s), have had higher influence on the formation of published knowledge trajectory than other papers. In addition, papers from firm and non-firm (university and public research institution) collaborations show higher novelty and conventionality than other papers. These findings deepen our understanding of the role of firms in the evolution of emerging science-related technology. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates the firm size-innovation puzzle through distinguishing radical from incremental innovation, and examining the country-level context (i.e., university-industry collaboration in R&D and competition intensity) that the firm size-innovation relationship is contingent on. The meta-analysis including 162 studies with 112,639 firms reveals that firm size can simultaneously benefit for radical and incremental innovations, while the measurement of firm size using the non-personnel indices can result in significant difference between the firm size-radical innovation and firm size-incremental innovation. Additionally, it is found that the positive relationship between firm size and radical innovation increases when university-industry collaboration in R&D and competition intensity is stronger. This study quantitatively summarises the relationship between firm size and radical/incremental innovation and updates the correlations reported in established literatures. Drawing on awareness-motivation-capability perspective, it takes an essential and frontier step in testing the country-level context that can influence the effect of firm size on innovation.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

AB  - Research commercialisation of innovative, new scientific and technology knowledge originating from universities and public research organisations depends on the transfer of the entrepreneurial intention of research scientists into actual entrepreneurial behaviour. The scientific research output generated from government funded research and development institutions is not always commercialised through the creation of technology-based firms. Hence, there remains a gap in understanding the factors that influences the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behaviour of research scientist. This study is based on a literature review to develop the conceptual framework and identify factors that influence the implementation of entrepreneurial behaviour of research scientists to participate in research commercialisation through the creation of technology-based firms. This study contributes to the field of technology-based entrepreneurship by identifying critical factors required for closing the literature gap on the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behaviour of research scientists. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Introduction: In recent years, the issue of entrepreneurship and innovation within Iran's health system has received significant attention. Therefore, this study aims to explain the indicators for measuring the development of entrepreneurship within the framework of Iranian universities of medical sciences. Methods: Indicators for measuring entrepreneurship development were desined using a literature review, semi-structured interviews, expert panel, and the Delphi technique. The participants in this study included 24 experts and senior managers from Iran's health system and universities of medical sciences in the field of entrepreneurship in the health system, as well as, experts from other sectors, including university faculties of the Ministry of Science and Research. Experts were selected from various departments based on the specific criteria through and purposeful sampling. Thematic analysis method was used manually to analyze the data. Results: The systematic literature review examined 13 studies, identifying 82 entrepreneurship indicators. This study, through a systematic review and expert opinion, finally identified 50 entrepreneurship indicators in six main areas: infrastructure and entrepreneurship development capacities (13 indicators), research (11 indicators), education (7 indicators), management and structure (2 indicators), investment and foundation in academic entrepreneurship (8 indicators) and productivity and outcome of academic entrepreneurship (9 indicators). Conclusion: This study developed specific indicators for measuring entrepreneurship in universities of medical sciences, which can be utilized for assessment and planning to improve the state of entrepreneurship in these institutions. © 2024 The Author(s); Published by Iran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to understand how universities develop and support student entrepreneurship. We did a preliminary Systematic Literature Review (SRL) on scientific articles regarding student entrepreneurship published during the last twenty years. Our findings empha-size three main research areas, emerging from a cluster analysis: (i) student entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention; (ii) university support for entrepreneurship; (iii) entrepreneurship education and learning. Particularly, our study points out that the new paradigm of the entrepreneurial university overcame the classical university model through the introduction of many innovations to foster student entrepreneurship. This paper provides an SLR on university role in fostering student entrepreneurship and it is useful for the academic and professional community. Additionally, it is original because it highlights the future directions of entrepreneurship and the main innovations adopted by universities to help students in the development of entrepreneurial initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In a knowledge economy era, universities have been significant in their knowledge generation role. To provide this role, universities transform themselves by improving their research infrastructure, creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem, and educating students with an applied perspective. There are many review studies on entrepreneurial universities in literature but they are lacking in proposing a transition pathway for higher education institutions in different national development contexts. Therefore, in this study, we aim to explore the cognitive background of entrepreneurial university (EPU) concepts and, based on our findings, propose a transition pathway for higher education institutions by considering different national development contexts. Document citation analysis is applied for understanding the cognitive background of the concept and literature review, and the findings of document citation analysis shed light on while proposing a transition pathway. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Knowledge transfer in university-industry collaboration (KTUIC) has been a hot issue of concern in recent years. Based on 874 articles published in the core collection of Web of Science, this paper conducts an in-depth bibliometric and visual analysis in terms of literature distribution, cooperation network, co-citation, knowledge base, and research hotspots analysis. The results show that the number of annual publications has shown an approximate exponential growth in the past decades. The UK is the most critical node in cross-border cooperation. Alessandro Muscio, with 11 publications, and Henry Etzkowitz, with 793 citations, are the most prolific and cited authors respectively. Research Policy has the highest frequency of citations. The knowledge base of KTUIC includes UIC and knowledge transfer, basic theories of U-I relationships, university TTOs, Bayh-Dole Act and university patenting, and individuals in university technology transfer. Research hotspots mainly focus on the related issues of third mission and entrepreneurial universities. Additionally, we also propose the future research agenda of KTUIC from the perspective of five knowledge bases. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the development status and core issues in KTUIC, and offer valuable guidance for future research directions.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This research was conducted with the aim of compiling and updating the available information on Digital Transformation, in order to provide relevant academic material for future research. The main objective was to analyse theoretical and empirical studies on the perspectives of different authors in Latin America during the last decade, formulating the following question: What is known about the digital transformation in companies in all sectors in Latin America in the last 10 years? Therefore, a search for scientific articles was carried out in different reliable databases, obtaining a total of 397,477 articles, 87 of which were downloaded and 50 were subsequently selected (18 in Scopus, 10 in Ebsco, 10 in Proquest, 03 in Redalyc, 07 in Scielo and 02 in Dialnet). Thus, after analysing the collected literature, different approaches were found, such as: economics, finance, business, industry, education, communications, digitisation and technology. Its positive impact on companies in all sectors in Latin America is evident, as it provides time optimisation in different processes, and improvements in management and quality. Therefore, it will be essential for companies to continue adapting to the coming changes, given that the Digital Transformation will continue to evolve.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Technology transfer (TT) is a complex process that considers various components and variables. The mechanisms underlying innovation and TT have led to the development of applications in a context of sustainable development, framing an expanding area of research in terms of bibliometric quantity, quality, and structural indicators in recent years. Although there is considerable academic interest in TT in the context of sustainable development, there has not been a recent analysis of the literature in the field to assess its relevance in terms of scientific impact, citations, and other information prior to the literature search/publication process. Therefore, the present paper conducts a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer to assess research performance and to perform a scientific mapping of the most relevant literature in the field included in the Web of Science (W.o.S.) database. Furthermore, 39,958 manuscripts published between 1976 and 2022 have been systematically assessed in terms of influential indicators, citations, and publication trends. Major contributors in the field include the United States, China, and England, while the most prolific journals include Sustainability, Environmental Science & Technology, and Applied Energy. This study contributes to the scientific literature by providing a significant theoretical reference for the potential application of TT in the context of sustainable development through statistical analysis and interpretation of the bibliometric data obtained. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In post-secondary education, research and teaching are critical to one another, and achieving the mutual benefit of the two is a constant pursuit for university professors. While many previous studies have focused on integrating state-of-the-art findings into business and management classes, little literature discusses how teaching may directly benefit research. The current paper argues that well-designed educational games can facilitate knowledge transfer and function as experiments to boost business disciplinary research. Specifically, the paper presents how the forecast sharing game, a popular game for supply chain management classes, can be employed to study the influencing factors of trust and trustworthiness in a supply chain. Using the game to conduct an experiment with a between-subjects design and analyzing a linear mixed model, the authors show that the game is able to not only disseminate critical concepts to students but simultaneously serve as an experiment for examining behavioral decisions in a supply chain and generate exciting novel research findings. The authors find that retailers' cooperation and suppliers' trust behaviors are influenced by the level of average market demand, a result that enriches the extant literature. The findings are further replicated with participants from a different knowledge background. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study deals with the primary areas and the present dynamics related to entrepreneurial capacity (EC); apart from this, it provides research directions in EC’s research field that would be of use in the future. With the aid of bibliometric analysis, we analysed Google Scholar, Scopus, and the ISI Web of Science databases and arrived at 193 studies that we use as samples; these studies enable us to recognise the research activity conducted on EC from 1979 to 2022. The most influential articles and authors have been identified based on their publications, citations, location, and importance within the network. Apart from this, we investigate current themes, discover barriers to development in literature, and provide ways for future research. Although research activity on EC occurs globally, there is a shortage of studies concerning developing countries’ context; countries experience a lack of collaboration, which is observed explicitly between the authors of developing and developed countries. This research focuses on broadly two themes: entrepreneurship education (EE) as an antecedent of EC, which, in turn, is an antecedent to entrepreneurial intention (EI), and EC as an antecedent factor of firm performance and economic growth. Interestingly, there is also a rising focus on Entrepreneurial Universities. We conclude by suggesting potential research directions. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The past decade has witnessed a rapid development of open government data practices and academic research. However, there is no systematic survey of existing research to understand the evolution of open government data. Such research can facilitate knowledge transfer within and across domains, and foster learning for countries in the early stages of open government data development. This study quantitively extracted the evolution trajectory of open government data based on the main path analysis method and then analysed the underlying motivations. The results show that open government data research went through four main phases and that the open government data movement has spread towards developing countries and smart cities. Different challenges and issues faced by the researchers in each phase drove the evolution of open government data research. Finally, we discuss future directions of open government data research based on our findings and recent development. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces. Points for practitioners: Open government data efforts have evolved over the years into a global phenomenon. Countries have learned from each other and more and more efforts are focused on innovating with open government data by stimulating co-creation and using other incentives. The way that data are opened should focus on achieving goals like innovation, participation, transparency and accountability. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: Scholars have emphasized intellectual capital’s importance for universities in obtaining competitive advantages and creating value. The purpose of this paper is to identify the influences of two components of intellectual capital, relational and human capital at the international level, and psychological capital on international orientation of academic entrepreneurs, and the mediating effects of international relational and human capital. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a literature review, a theoretical model is proposed to explain the relationship between the studied variables. Our hypotheses are tested on a sample of 173 academic spin-offs of Spanish universities using bootstrapping methodology. Findings: The results show that the international market relational capital and international human capital of academic entrepreneurs influence their international orientation, and that their psychological capital is directly, and indirectly, related to international orientation through international human capital and international market relational capital. Practical implications: This study provides a better understanding of the antecedents of the international orientation of academic entrepreneurs, which would provide an important contribution to the literature on intellectual capital, academic entrepreneurship and internationalization. The achieved results highlight important implications for training of academic entrepreneurs and for managers and management teams of companies willing to enter, or even those already operating in, international markets. Originality/value: In this study, the international orientation of academic entrepreneurs is explained through the psychological capital that is studied jointly with two components of intellectual capital, relational and human capital at the international level. Although some recent work has focused on the study of the internationalization of academic spin-off, this line of research is still incipient. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In recent years, efforts to transform scientific information produced in basic sciences into technology to facilitate daily life have been increasing. In this sense, the perspective of entrepreneurship gains importance in basic sciences. This study aims analyze documents published on entrepreneurship in basic sciences (physics, chemistry, biology) using a bibliometric review. For this aim, the bibliometric analysis method based on the systematic literature review approach was used. Systematic review was carried out in the WoS database. A total of 428 documents (1994-2020) on entrepreneurship in basic sciences in the WoS were retrieved. The bibliometric analysis results were presented under two main categories as descriptive (numbers of documents according to year, author, country, organization, source, research area, WoS category area) and evaluative results (co-occurrence, co-authorship, citation analysis). Descriptive results were displayed with frequency values, and evaluative results were displayed using VOSviewer visualization software. As a result, it was determined that there is an important increase in the number of documents towards 2020. In addition, it was determined that the most productive, influential, and collaborative author is Jardım-Goncalves R, the most productive country is the USA, the most productive journal is Journal of Technology Transfer, and the most productive organization is Old Dominion University. Moreover, it has been determined that the most influential area in terms of research area is “business economics” and the most keyword co-occurrences are “entrepreneurship”, “design science” and “academic entrepreneurship”. © 2023,Journal of Turkish Science Education.

AB  - University-industry cooperation (UIC) is increasingly seen as an essential innovation strategy and technology transfer offices (TTOs) play an important role in this process but are still neglected by industries and researchers. Public policies have been developed worldwide since the Bay-dole act in 1980, but emerging countries still face difficulties in promoting UIC compared to developed countries. This article aims to highlight and compare the main motivations and barriers for UIC in Brazilian and Irish TTOs. Based on a literature review, a questionnaire was applied to the heads of nine TTOs. This research is characterized as a multiple case study with a qualitative approach. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the TTOs from Ireland and Brazil have different motivations for cooperation, but face similar barriers despite the completely different contexts they are in. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economa y Negocios.

AB  - Waste management is a crucial issue for developing countries, as it affects their environment, health and economy. Poor waste management can lead to pollution, disease outbreaks, greenhouse gas emissions and social conflicts. Therefore, developing countries need to adopt strategic decisions to improve their waste management systems and practices. This article explores waste management in some developed country such as Singapore, Sweden, Germany, and Japan and compare them with Algerian situation. The objective is to assess the gap between the approaches adopted by these countries, in order to identify good practices and opportunities for improvement in Algeria. The document examines the scientific research and academic contribution in the field of waste management, then presents the types of waste. It analyzes the infrastructures, the technologies used, the methods of collection, sorting, recycling, and disposal of waste. Relevant policies, departments and agencies in each country are also reviewed, with an emphasis on laws and regulations specific to waste management. The results of this comparative study highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the waste management system in Algeria compared to other countries. Good practices identified elsewhere are discussed, highlighting opportunities for knowledge transfer and best practices that can be applied in Algeria. Finally, recommendations are made to improve the waste management system in Algeria, taking into account the socioeconomic and environmental realities of the country.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Technology commercialization has become an increasingly important activity for European and U.S. universities. Among the reasons for this importance have been declining government financial support for public universities, greater accountability to funding agencies, and increased expectations for commercialization revenues. Combined with recent economic uncertainty, the search for additional revenue sources has accentuated the need to better involve faculty in successful technology commercialization efforts. Thus, university administrators and technology managers face challenges in attracting, engaging, and retaining faculty participation in this effort. This paper reviews the relevant literature to understand how tenure and promotion policies can incentivize or disincentivize faculty members from pursuing technology commercialization projects. Prior research has focused primarily on the determinants of performance and benchmarking issues while faculty career path choices have been neglected. We address this gap in the literature by considering technology commercialization, faculty choice, and institutional policies in tandem. We conducted a systematic review of relevant literature on faculty involvement in technology commercialization and identified incentives and impediments for pursuing technology commercialization. Next we developed research hypotheses drawn from the literature review to assess faculty attitudes and activities, and their career development stage, based on the literature. Data collected through surveys will be used to test the hypotheses. We propose that the choice to participate in technology commercialization is a risk-payoff decision for faculty that depends on their career stage and subject matter area of work. As the faculty member becomes more secure in their position, such as tenured, the perceived risk of participation declines while the perceived reward value of incentives increase. As this perception changes due to career stage progress, we expect that faculty will be more inclined to participate in technology commercialization activities. We discuss how choices involving technology commercialization projects relate to a faculty career path and institutional technology commercialization policies, and how these policies are used to promote faculty participation in technology commercialization projects. © 2024 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

AB  - Theoretical frameworks acknowledge the dynamic and evolving nature of technology transfer. However, there is a scarcity of empirical work in the field incorporating a dynamic and longitudinal perspective. Several literature reviews call for technology transfer research agendas to include longitudinal studies. In response to such calls, this special section comprises selected contributions to the 2018 Technology Transfer Society (T2S) Conference which address this gap from different angles. The three qualitative and three quantitative works chosen contain research questions and methodologies related to dynamic aspects of technology transfer. We argue that historical and processual studies offer additional new directions. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In ordinary work life, extended reality (XR), which here collectively refers to virtual, augmented, and mixed (VR, AR, MR) reality, is becoming more prevalent. This essay offers a thorough analysis of academic works on XR that show modifications to the way labour is actually organized. We examine XR research's theoretical and methodological foundations as well as its application areas. The PRISMA statement was followed during the evaluation procedure. The primary application domains of XR were design, remote collaboration, and training. By modifying the perception of space, XR made it possible to overcome constraints imposed by time and space, safety, and resources. It is still rather uncommon to do research on XR applications in real-world workplace contexts, and it mostly focuses on three areas: teamwork, knowledge transfer evaluation, and working procedures. The most prevalent application of XR was virtual reality, albeit the hardware used varies depending on the situation. Collaboration, work habits, and knowledge transfer evaluation were the four XR research areas we defined, which roughly mirrored the application domains. Only a few recent studies used unique methods of data collection, such as videotaping participants' movement in virtual reality, in the articles we evaluated. We could not identify any XR-specific procedures in the articles we reviewed. For the time being, XR still has a lot of potential rather than definite general advantages in the workplace. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The objective is analyzing the trends in Social Entrepreneurship Education as a multidisciplinary research field. A systematic review of the literature on the intersection: Education and Social Entrepreneurship, with the support of scientific literature and a careful search methodology. It collects articles from the WOS Core collection database published between 2000 and 2022. A total of 367 articles are analyzed to answer the three research questions. The results of the analysis are twelve dimensions identified according to the literature in the field of social entrepreneurship education; after using lexicometric analysis and Iramuteq software, the main trends on the topics are found and discussed and the relationship of terms and concepts in the abstract and title text of the analyzed articles is shown, showing the frequency, importance of linkage, and co-occurrences of lexical units. Six clusters of nodes and related terms are confirmed: entrepreneur, development and innovation, education, entrepreneurial university, context, and types of study. These clusters show the concern for the field of study of social entrepreneurship education and the need to find a consensus on the concept of an entrepreneur and on what is social entrepreneurship in education. The wide range of topics, dispersed and fragmented, continues to offer opportunities for specificity. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper provides an analysis of the literature on transnational education to identify the key challenges and success factors for the sustainable operation of transnational higher education (TNE) programmes as perceived by key stakeholders. Probing the stakeholders’ perspectives and applying a systematic approach, this study analyses 227 English-written articles retrieved from the Web of Science database published from 2000 to 2021. Key challenges identified include difficulties in managing the TNE programmes, ensuring quality assurance, adapting the curricula to the local contexts, accommodating offshore students’ learning styles, creating studying environments for TNE students equivalent to those in the home institutions, ensuring preparedness of the academic staff, and facilitating the knowledge transfer in the host countries. The analysis also highlights six factors for the sustainable development of TNE programmes, including the effectiveness of the operations, the internationalization of the curricula, the transnational experience of the students, the development of the transnational staff, the existence of a proper regulatory framework in the host countries, and the development of a global systematic data collection for quality assurance. In addition, the evidence collected suggests that while the transition from domestic into a foreign programme can be rewarding, it demands appropriate planning and implementation. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.

AB  - Background: Identifying cancer-specific physical activity programs and post-secondary courses targeting students in academic settings (i.e., “real world” opportunities) may promote physical activity behaviors among cancer survivors. Using knowledge synthesis methods such as systematic scoping study methods may facilitate knowledge tool development and guide evidence-based practice to improve knowledge transfer. However, identifying these opportunities poses a challenge as systematic scoping study methods have yet to be applied and adapted to this context. Thus, to extend systematic scoping study methods, the purpose of the current investigation is to describe the adaptation of systematic scoping study methods in the context of cancer-specific “real world” opportunities in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Systematic scoping study methods were adapted to develop a knowledge tool, which was a credible resource website for researchers, clinicians, and survivors. Three search strategies including Advanced Google Search, targeted website search, and consultations with experts were used to identify eligible (e.g., appropriate for cancer survivors, offered in the community) cancer-specific physical activity programs. Only the targeted website search was used to search post-secondary institutions because they are centralized onto one government website. Results: Fifty-eight programs and 10 post-secondary courses met the eligibility criteria. Relevant data from these opportunities were extracted, charted, synthesized, and uploaded onto the resource website. The most successful search strategy for cancer-specific physical activity programs was the targeted website search followed by Google Advanced Search and consultations with content experts. Conclusions: Challenges were experienced due to lack of standard reporting among opportunities, bias of potentially relevant records, and changing nature of resulting records. The current investigation demonstrated that systematic scoping study methods can be applied to cancer-specific physical activity programs and post-secondary courses in the context of cancer survivorship in Ontario yielding robust results. The method can be further adapted and updated in future knowledge syntheses in health-related contexts. Systematic review registration: The systematic scoping review method protocol has not been registered. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates the motivations and channels utilized by universities in establishing university-industry partnerships. The research focuses on a case study conducted at the largest higher education institution in Armenia. A comprehensive literature review was initially conducted to gain a deep understanding of the motivations and channels within the framework of university-industry partnerships. Data for this study was collected through online questionnaires administered to the YSU Faculty Administrative Staff, including deans and chairs. Additionally, a documentary analysis was employed as a supplementary data collection method. The analysis of the literature resulted in the development of a hierarchical classification with group/subgroup divisions for the collaboration channels, which distinguishes itself from other variations by encompassing all possible channels. Furthermore, a set of criteria was developed to assess the impact, practical applicability, and feasibility of each collaboration channel. Based on the survey results, these criteria were used to characterize each collaboration channel. The study also examined the primary constraints and difficulties associated with university-industry partnerships. The findings of the study offer several suggestions and implications for policy development. Copyright © 2023– All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping numerous sectors, including education. This study delves into AI in education (AIEd) within Africa, analyzing its trends, opportunities, challenges, and prospective paths. Employing the PRISMA framework, we systematically reviewed 22 articles published from 2017 to 2022. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of AIEd in Africa's educational landscape, highlighting the shift towards adaptive testing, particularly computer-adaptive testing (CAT), and its advantages, like precise student assessments and reduced test durations. The study also explores strategies to enhance graduate employability, emphasizing university-industry collaborations, curriculum updates, and quality assurance. Furthermore, it examines the implications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) in education, advocating for integrating emerging technologies and adapting educational content and practices to meet digital-era challenges. While technology integration, including smartphones and ICT tools like Moodle, shows promise for enriching learning experiences, we identify pressing challenges such as resource contextualization, teacher training, and ethical issues. The study concludes with targeted recommendations for educators, policymakers, and African stakeholders to harness AIEd effectively. Emphasizing areas like adaptive testing, robust university-industry partnerships, 4IR-aligned curriculum development, and ethical, inclusive technology integration, these recommendations aim to empower African education systems to capitalize on AIEd's benefits while navigating the complexities of the digital age. © 2025, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

AB  - Purpose: There is a gap between the development of technological innovations for rehabilitation settings and the long-term adoption of the innovations in the settings. The purpose then is to study the developer´s perspectives on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of technological innovations for rehabilitation in clinical settings. Methods: A qualitative research study was undertaken with biomedical engineers working at university. Two focus groups were conducted with open-ended questions to explore their perceptions of technology development and perceived barriers and facilitators during implementation. The analysis included preliminary coding based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), review and discussion of emerging themes. Results: Eleven technology developers (biomedical engineers, researchers) took part in the study. Among the main barriers identified were the fact that the source of the innovations is the literature state of the art, and the underlying aim of the innovations is to provide an original solution. Also the results showed a lack of consensus regarding the end user of the innovations and the lack of consideration of the characteristics valued by the clinic. Among the facilitators identified, the adaptability of the innovations to the clinical setting stands out. Conclusions: In this group of developers there is a duality between the scientific originality of innovations and the transferable nature of these developments. This acts as a barrier to generating technology that meets user requirements. Working in interdisciplinary teams is one of the best alternatives to achieve this. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM) 2024.

The WHO African Regional Oral Health Strategy and the WHO Global Strategy on Oral Health were endorsed in 2016 and 2022, respectively, to address the current alarming situation by integrating oral diseases as part of NCDs toward universal health coverage (UHC). Both strategies highlighted the importance of research, especially the necessity to create and continuously update context- and needs-specific research; however, there is a paucity of information regarding research supporting evidence-informed oral health policies in the region. In this context, the University of Pennsylvania, African universities led by the University of Nairobi, and the WHO Regional Office for Africa initiated an “Evidence to Policy” project. This project consists of 3 phases: (1) preparation: stakeholder analysis; (2) co-creation: online needs assessment survey with oral health academia in the region and 2 scoping literature reviews to identify oral health research and barriers and facilitators for the development, dissemination, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of oral health policies; and (3) validation: sharing findings from phase 2 through the stakeholder meetings. This executive summary presents the results of phase 3, the stakeholder in-person meeting held in November 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya. About 70 participants, including oral health educators and representatives from the Ministry of Health and WHO in the region, discussed and identified actionable recommendations based on findings from phase 2. Then, participants assessed their alignment with the WHO Global Strategy. At the end of the meeting, participants pledged to maintain the relationships between academia and policy makers and will work collectively toward UHC for oral health for all in the region based on the “Nairobi Declaration.” Knowledge Transfer Statement: This executive summary can be used by all key stakeholders involved in creating, disseminating, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating oral health policies in the African region to leverage research and accelerate the implementation of the WHO Global and African Regional Strategies on Oral Health. © International Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research and American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research 2024.

AB  - China's specific developmental context defines the need to understand its state logic of knowledge transfer, particularly from the agency perspective of universities. This paper proposes the new term 'university engagement with industry' (UEI) to highlight the active role of universities in university-industry linkages. A structural method is adopted to collect relevant literature and to provide a systematic and critical review of China's UEI. This paper makes four key contributions: (1) it illustrates a structural approach to collect literature via precise and transparent identification for a targeted topic from an interdisciplinary research field; (2) it systematically presents the China-specific external institutional environment and internal governance of universities for knowledge transfer and captures influential factors for university's embeddedness in multiscalar innovation systems; (3) it identifies China-specific UEI in comparison to Western findings; and (4) it suggests a research agenda on China's UEI for future studies.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Community-based disaster management and access to social resilience during disasters are fundamentally based on the concept of participation of all social groups. Up to now, no comprehensive study has been done regarding adolescents’ roles and experiences in all stages of disaster management, and discussions existing in the domain of adolescents’ engagement in disaster risk management are usually restricted to children’s participation. Thus, this study aims to extract the effective components and factors in disaster education to improve adolescents’ resilience to disasters. Design/methodology/approach: This systematic review was done through English databases and three Persian databases between August 18, 2001, and August 31, 2021. The articles were searched based on the PRISMA checklist using four key dimensions of “resilience,” “disasters,” “adolescents” and “education.” Finally, the effective components and factors in disaster education for improving adolescents’ resilience during disasters were extracted. Findings: Totally, 29,856 articles were extracted through the systematic review. After studying the titles, abstracts and contents of the extracted articles, 17 were selected for the final analysis. Among these articles, 3, 12 and 2 had qualitative, quantitative and mixed research designs, respectively. The extracted components were categorized into five major categories including education, community, adolescents, resilience and governing policies and approaches. Research limitations/implications: Unfortunately, due to sanctions, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences did not have access to the Embase database, and consequently, this database could not be used. Originality/value: The results of this systematic review presented an overall view of the effective components of adolescents’ disaster resilience education. The formation of thoughts developed feelings, and social knowledge in this age group provides a wide range of opportunities for social empowerment and intergenerational knowledge transfer. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Digital businesses defy the models and theories of traditional entrepreneurship. This study proposes a refined digital business model canvas (DBMC) to address digital entrepreneurship’s unique challenges and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a systematic literature review alongside a double-round validation of semi-structured interviews and qualitative research. We interviewed digital entrepreneurs from university spin-offs until we reached data saturation in the first round, contributing to internal validity. Then, the new model was validated in the second round of interviews. Findings: The DBMC successfully bridges gaps identified in the conventional BMC by enhancing strategic focus, clarifying financial planning and improving early adopter identification. Validation interviews confirm that the adapted framework is better aligned to the operational realities of digital ventures, reinforcing its theoretical contribution through a nuanced application of the resource-based view. Research limitations/implications: The study’s qualitative design and sample from a single innovation agency may limit generalizability; further testing in diverse settings is recommended. Practical implications: The DBMC provides a robust, adaptable framework for digital entrepreneurs, offering valuable insights for strategic planning, entrepreneurial education and policy development. It integrates new components – such as early adopters, investment sources, pricing and employee relationships – and adapts existing elements. Originality/value: The originality is twofold: we examined the business model canvas using additional resources in a digital context, enhancing the likelihood of success for digital business practitioners; we also revamped Barney´s VRIO (value, rarity, imitability and organization) model, stressing the importance of resources and capabilities in the novel (digital) context. © 2025, Beatriz Garcia Altafin, Cristiano Morini and Daniel Henrique Dario Capitani.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to synthesize extant literature on the concept of reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) built up over the past two decades with the help of bibliometric analyssis and also to suggest promising new areas for research in this field. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a literature review methodology combined with bibliometric and network analysis based on 117 papers identified from the Scopus database. In particular, this study has tried to identify and capture themes not previously fully captured or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. Findings: The authors have identified research themes and research gaps in the area of RKT. Overall, the review shows the main outlets that have published papers on RKT and the theoretical background this research is built on. This study exhibits core themes in this area that have persisted and grown consistently such as the subsidiary’s role in RKT. In addition, the review highlights less researched themes such as role of boundary spanning in RKT, which open exciting avenues for new research opportunities. Research limitations/implications: This study finds that RKT research has experienced remarkable growth from a complete viewpoint in recent years. There was a surge in publications in the area from 2008 onwards, and many of its influential papers seemed to have been published between 2013 and 2018. Prominent themes in this body of research have been identified and potential for future studies has been explored. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to map, synthesize and discuss the literature concerning RKT. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In addition to their traditional teaching and research roles, universities have expanded their activities, taking on a third mission, in order to boost the social and economic development of the region they operate in. This study examines the alignment between the institutional mechanisms that enable third mission activities in Brazilian public universities and the dimensions of social impact proposed in the literature. As for its methods, a rapid systematic review of the literature, content analysis of public universities’ mission statements, and a survey on the existence of Technological Innovation Centers (NIT) were carried out. The literature review indicates that the concepts of third mission and triple helix reflect a worldwide trend of redirectioning universities’ mission, widening the possibilities of social impact. The mission statements of Brazilian public universities still do not fully incorporate third mission activities. However, there is evidence of their commitment to sustainable development and technological innovation, a fact that points to an adaptation by universities to contemporary demands to strengthen their social impact. © (2025), (SciELO-Scientific Electronic Library Online).

AB  - Even before the Act on the Financing of the Phase Out of Subsidised Hard Coal Mining came into force at the end of 2018, the effects of mine flooding on mining damage were increasingly becoming the focus of public attention. In order to pool knowledge on the possible effects of mine flooding on the surface in advance, the working group “Heave phenomena due to mine and groundwater rise” was estab lished on 14th September 2006 by a resolution of the board and the advisory board of the Deutscher Markscheider-Verein e.V.. The working group (www.dmv-ev.de/arbeitskreise/bodenbewegungen. html) is made up of representatives from active mining companies, rehabilitation mining, mining administrations, universities and specific institutions. © 2024, Bergbau-Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH.

AB  - Scoping reviews are instrumental for synthesizing evidence and mapping research landscapes, but effective stakeholder engagement is also essential to ensure their relevance to both practice and policy. Despite its importance, stakeholder engagement in leisure and tourism scoping reviews has been limited. This methodological paper presents the Co-Creation Scoping Review Framework (CSRF) to enhance collaborative knowledge creation. By expanding the traditional five-stage scoping review process to seven stages, the CSRF places a strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement, effectively bridging the divide between researchers and stakeholders. This framework enhances the relevance of scoping reviews for both academic and practical applications, promoting more inclusive research methods, improving knowledge mobilization, and guiding future practice and research. The paper provides detailed guidance on implementing the CSRF, including a step-by-step approach and examples from recent leisure and tourism scoping reviews, demonstrating how the CSRF could have been applied to engage stakeholders and increase the relevance of findings. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The dynamics of supply chain networks have changed due to increasing complexities. Global expansions and knowledge transfer in supply chain networks bring efficiency and effectiveness to companies. However, the probability of supply chain complexity has also been seen increasing. The barriers to sustainable supply chain networks need to be tackled in an effective manner as they impact business operations. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate and reduce the supply chain complexities, as it will facilitate the process of knowledge transfer and increase the implementation of sustainable practises in supply chain networks. In the previous research, four supply chain complexity drivers were identified. Previous research identified four supply chain complexity drivers by conducting a systematic review. This study investigates which of the four complexity drivers impacts knowledge transfer in the context of the food supply chain sector. Methods: In this research, knowledge transfer is therefore examined from the perspective of sustainable food supply chains. Thirty exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted in this study and analysed using Nvivo (v12) software. This study utilised thematic analysis techniques for the evaluation of the interviews to gather results. Results: The results illustrated six main factors classified under broad categories: integration of Knowledge Transfer, incorporation of technological advancements in supply chain networks, supply chain complexity solutions, supply chain complexity drivers, sustainable supply chain networks, and capability to reduce supply chain complexity. The findings of this study highlight that process complexity significantly influences the process of knowledge transfer in food supply chain networks. The research findings contribute to both academic and practical domains. This study contributes to the aggregation of supply chain complexity and its impact on Knowledge Transfer. Additionally, the findings support supply chain networks, which strive to achieve efficient Knowledge Transfer to attain sustainable value in business operations. Conclusion: This study has proven that robust knowledge transfer reduces supply chain complexity as it makes supply chain systems more resilient and well-coordinated in many potential ways. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - University spin-offs (USOs) have attracted significant attention from scholars and policymakers as an important mechanism for science-based innovation. The debate on how USOs generate innovation outcomes has often focused on tangible assets, while the role of intangible assets has been less explored and remains loosely defined. Yet emerging research suggests that intangible assets, especially in the early stages of a USO's lifecycle, have a critical influence on its survival and future success, highlighting a need for a better understanding of how intangible assets enable science-based innovation through USOs. Drawing from several streams of literature, we define intangible assets in the context of science-based innovation through USOs: an intangible asset is a resource that is non-physical, non-financial, has long life, and has potential to provide future benefits to the owner. Based on this working definition, we conduct a systematic literature review of the leading innovation management journals and inductively derive a framework outlining the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of science-based innovation through USOs, focusing on the influence of intangible assets. The framework identifies the categories of resources which can enhance or hinder science-based innovation through USOs. Such categorization reveals fruitful directions for future research such as a deeper examination of societal outcomes. We conclude by offering recommendations for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to better leverage intangible assets to enhance science-based innovation. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The main purpose of this research is to analyze the exploration and exploitation of knowledge in universities that support innovation and entrepreneurship in their environment. For this, the Performance Measurement Systems (PMS) of the universities management are analyzed as a proxy for the implementation of the strategic vision of the universities. This study is based on a systematic literature review on the subject, supported by the technical possibilities offered by the MAXQDA (The Art of Data Analysis) program. The databases used were the following: Elsevier (Science Direct), Springer, Wiley and Taylor & Francis. The main findings suggest that organizational ambidexterity, in general, develops unevenly and from different approaches, among which innovation, learning and strategy stand out. However, organizational ambidexterity hardly develops in a university context, where most of the university activities require some knowledge of the technological frontier. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and understand these two dimensions (exploration and exploitation) and their positive influence on entrepreneurship. In a context where the development of technology and science happens at an ever-increasing speed, a balance between exploration and exploitation is necessary, which should be reflected in the different control mechanisms in academic environments, such as the Performance Measurement Systems (PMS). The analysis of these systems will allow to know the position of the universities in the face of ambidexterity. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - With the increasing demand for digitalization, organizations look to emerging technologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to increase their business performance. This makes it essential to identify and select the most suitable processes to maximize the benefits for organizations. However, despite the increasing interest of academics and professionals in RPA, the literature lacks a study on the main criteria organizations should consider to decide which processes to automate. Therefore, this research lists the main criteria for process automation based on scientific and professional know-how. A systematic literature review was performed, followed by a Delphi study with RPA professionals, to tune the former insights collected from the scientific literature. Our findings point to 32 criteria that organizations and decision-makers should consider before choosing which processes to automate. Feasibility, process description, and input and output data are the most voted. The criteria are evaluated with 18 processes in six organizations with positive results. While professionals may find valuable information in this document to help them decide which processes must be automated first, academics are now aware of which areas deserve further investigation. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.

AB  - Poor valuation of crop varieties developed by research organisations and universities lead to windfall gains or abnormal losses in economic returns for different stakeholders in the tech-commercialisation chain. Most institutes follow thumb rules such as fixed rates based on crop type or fixed percentage of net present value to determine license fees. Hence, there is a paucity of scientific basis to validate the price or actual value of the crop variety developed through research. The research to develop a standardised framework for crop varieties valuation in the public system is also in its initial stage. This study aims to identify suitable techniques for the valuation of crop varieties through a systematic review of the extant literature. We studied the trends in the publications and the major approaches used in the literature. We identified the best-fit technology valuation methodologies for crop varieties by comparing the factors under consideration for valuation. A framework for crop variety valuation was developed by considering its variables and appropriate techniques to be applied. The study is the first of its kind and provides a critical review for developing crop variety valuation protocols by future researchers and university tech transfer offices for better crop variety commercialisation prospects.

AB  - Innovation intermediaries (IIs) have gained more attention in both industry and academia since they are recognized as crucial actors that can facilitate the innovation process. This paper presents a systemic review of the academic research on IIs and suggests future research directions. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 556 documents from the Web of Science with Bibliometrix. The results show that IIs have experienced a surge of publications over the past three decades, with the UK and the US leading in productivity and influence. Although research on IIs occurs globally, cross-national collaboration is lacking, especially between authors of developed and developing countries. Our keyword co-occurrence analysis identified three major research clusters represented by innovation performance, knowledge networks, and technology transfer, which are also reflected in different stages of thematic evolution. Furthermore, we conducted a content analysis of the most influential articles across multiple disciplines and different time slices to identify the key discipline interests and provide a comprehensive picture of research themes over the years. We conclude by suggesting four potential avenues for future research. Our work provides an essential overview for understanding this critical field and serves as a valuable resource for policymakers and practitioners interested in IIs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Accurate pancreatic tumor segmentation remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and diverse tumor appearances. This study presents a Knowledge-Driven Evidence Fusion Segmentation Network (KEFS-Net), a framework that systematically integrates radiological and anatomical knowledge from medical reports with imaging features to enhance segmentation accuracy. KEFS-Net consists of three key components: (1) a knowledge-driven attention network that leverages large language models, discrete information bottleneck, and cross-attention to enhance CT image segmentation performance by capturing informative features from medical reports, (2) an evidence fusion strategy based on Dempster–Shafer theory that optimizes segmentation results by evaluating the consistency between textual knowledge and image predictions, and (3) a masked learning approach that ensures robust performance in clinical scenarios with incomplete tumor descriptions. The framework was evaluated on both the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset and an external clinical dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital (FAH) of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice of 59.10% and 59.42% respectively for tumor segmentation on the MSD and external dataset. The approach shows particular strength in handling diverse tumor characteristics including size variations, boundary ambiguity, and complex anatomical locations. This knowledge-driven framework represents a significant advancement in leveraging domain knowledge through multi-modal integration for improved pancreatic tumor segmentation.

AB  - This paper analyses the conditions and factors influencing non-university researchers' career transitions back into academia. Using affiliation data in publications of German researchers, their cross-sector career transitions from the public research organisation Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and industry to universities are analysed. Although the rate of transitions is small, there are distinctive windows of opportunity at a junior career stage, especially for Fraunhofer researchers. Researchers who publish more and in more acclaimed journals, Fraunhofer researchers who co-publish with universities, and women are more likely to gain a university affiliation over the course of their career. These results indicate the influence of institutional proximity for cross-domain career transitions. The quality and impact of academic knowledge could be improved if the higher education sector was more open to recruitment of researchers from other sectors. Policy needs to target the barriers that preclude applied researchers from pursuing university careers. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - University spinoffs (USOs) are firms created to commercialize research outcomes or innovative technologies developed by university members. This paper adopts a systematic literature review approach for explorinhe trajectory of the USO research field. It categorizes the literature based on two perspectives: the process of how USOs develop and what factors can explain the variance of USO development; the paper critically examines the USO literature through these two lenses. By integrating these two perspectives and examining 120 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1987 and 2022, we develop a comprehensive model of USO development. The paper contributes to the extant literature on academic entrepreneurship by contending that while the “how” and “what” questions pose unique challenges for USO scholars, they cannot be separated because the process and variance models are complementary and important in advancing research on USOs. As such, we explore and identify specific factors that affect each of the distinct phases of the USO development at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels of analysis which form the basis for a rich future research agenda. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This research aims to improve knowledge exchange and innovation through collaborations between universities and industries in South-East European Countries (SEECs). The region benefits from better collaboration, and understanding factors such as proximity, motivations, and challenges is crucial. The study begins by suggesting that geographical closeness may influence the strength of university-industry ties and that specific conditions in SEECs may either support or impede these relationships. The paper proposes a new University-Industry Collaboration (UIC) model tailored for SEECs, built upon a review of literature from 2000 to 2022. This review examines factors like location, organizational approaches, types of knowledge exchange, key motivators and barriers, and the evolving role of universities in the region. The study introduces a specialized UIC model that could enhance regional cooperation, emphasizing strategies to overcome barriers and align university and industry goals. By extensively reviewing existing research, the paper contributes valuable insights into UIC in SEECs, aiming to deepen the understanding of these collaborations in the region. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - In practical industrial scenarios, the variations of operating conditions such as load and rotational speed make mechanical systems subject to complex and variable environmental stresses, resulting in the distribution discrepancies of sample data. With the advantages of integrating the feature information and diagnosis knowledge, the transfer learning technique based on multiple source domains has become a stable and efficient solution to address the fault diagnosis challenge under variable operating conditions in the modern intelligent operation and maintenance. For the above discussions, a multi-source domain information fusion network (MDIFN) is proposed in this paper to obtain generalized knowledge with abundant feature information by combining the adversarial transfer learning technique with fine-grained information fusion of multiple source domains. First, an adversarial transfer network architecture is constructed in accordance with the complex feature transformation and the boundary equilibrium domain discrimination to implement feature learning and knowledge transfer of source and target domains. Then, a joint distribution domain adaptation mechanism is proposed to further facilitate the acquisition of domain invariant features. Finally, a class-related decision fusion (CDF) strategy is designed to realize the information fusion within the decision space. The fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under unknown operating conditions can be achieved by employing data under known multiple operating conditions for MDIFN training. The public Paderborn University (PU) bearing dataset and the actual mechanical comprehensive diagnosis simulation platform (MCDSP) bearing dataset from different testing rigs are considered to evaluate the cross-domain fault diagnosis performance of this method. The experimental results indicate that the method achieves an average accuracy of 95.97% on the PU dataset and 98.31% on the MCDSP dataset, which is superior to other state-of-the-art cross-domain fault diagnosis algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - International technology transfer (ITT) is commonly seen as an essential way to bridge the gap between highly advanced industrialised nations and developing countries. This gap is particularly pronounced with a view of African states. These generally have a limited capacity to cope with the effects of climate change. Therefore, foreign innovations must be successfully adopted to realities on the continent to mitigate the effects. This has sparked a growing academic interest in this topic in recent years, leading to many aspects being covered in the literature. This paper takes stock of the current state of the art, thereby asking the question: What do we know about the problems regarding international technology transfer to Africa? Employing a reproducible, transparent and clear systematic review, 73 relevant texts are identified. The barriers to more (successful) international technology transfer that these publications identify are discussed. As this review clarifies, many aspects are known, but specifics around governance aspects and institutional set-ups are primarily bypassed in the discussion. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - In recent decades, quantitative studies on university spinoffs (USOs) have begun to proliferate across disciplines. This study aims to systematically consolidate the measures used in the extant USO research into theoretical constructs, and connect the constructs to the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) perspective. In doing so, this study examines the effect of university-level characteristics on the number of USO establishments and USO performance; it also evaluates measurement validities that can reflect constructs. The systematic review and thematic coding reveal four groups of 14 constructs from the measures identified in prior studies: university general characteristics, university research characteristics, university entrepreneurial characteristics, and technology transfer office characteristics. Our meta-analyses indicate that the relationships between the constructs and USO outcomes are generally significant, thereby providing evidence of the convergent and nomological validities of the measures. Research design has a limited impact on the relationships, but country moderates several relationships between university characteristics and USO outcomes. Following our meta-analytic review, we explain the contribution to university entrepreneurship ecosystem research and suggest a theoretically triangulated model for future studies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Human resource management literature has increasingly focused on institutional complexity and action. We conducted a systematic review of HR actors' responses to institutional contradictions, which contained two questions: the first question identifies what institutional contradictions HR actors face and the second question reviewed HR actors' responses to these contradictions. We identified 52 articles for analysis after the screening. First, an overview of the theoretical lens, contexts, and dimensions of action in selected articles was presented. Then institutional contradictions including institutional pressures and conflict were reviewed and presented. Also, the types of actions were extracted and categorized from the articles. We presented a typology of four types of actions including (A) proactive legitimacy actions (institutional work, institutional entrepreneurship, and deinstitutionalization), (B) proactive institutional practices (combining logic, aligning interpretations, logic customization, and structural actions), (C) reactive institutional practices (use of logic, reducing tension, reconciliation and rejecting) and (D) reactive legitimacy actions (localization, adaptation, compliance, and institutional fit). This typology has two aspects: the type of actors' exposure to contradiction (proactive and reactive) and the direction of action (The Impact on the institutional context and conversely). Also, the epistemological distinctions of these four types of actions, the time and theoretical trends of the emergence of these actions in research, and the relevant conceptual framework were presented. Finally, directions for future research, discussion, and conclusions were described. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - This research critically examines the nexus between Human Resource (HR) practices and the Madani Framework's influence on enhancing graduate employability in Malaysia's higher education sector. Employing a systematic literature review methodology based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the study investigates how human resources strategies within educational institutions can align with the Madani Framework to cultivate a workforce poised for success in high-value industries. The systematic review synthesizes findings from 28 relevant studies, comprising quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research, identified through a comprehensive database search and screening process. The included studies are categorized into seven distinct themes: graduate employability skills and competencies, curriculum alignment and industry relevance, HR practices in higher education, the Madani Framework and educational policies, university-industry collaboration, faculty development and continuous learning, and graduate employability and economic development. The review highlights a persistent skills mismatch between graduate competencies and evolving industry demands, underscoring the need for strategic interventions. HR practices emerge as a powerful catalyst, enabling higher education institutions (HEIs) to align curricula with industry needs, foster industry-relevant skills among graduates, and embed the Madani Framework's principles of sustainability, ethics, and social responsibility. Key recommendations include conducting curriculum mapping and gap analyses, engaging in stakeholder collaborations, integrating emerging technologies and Industry 4.0 skills, and establishing mechanisms for continuous curriculum review and faculty development. Furthermore, the review underscores the pivotal role of HR strategies in promoting and sustaining effective university-industry collaborations, facilitating knowledge exchange and experiential learning opportunities. Leveraging innovative HR practices, such as aligning recruitment processes and performance evaluation criteria with the Madani Framework's competencies, is crucial for fostering a holistic and socially responsible workforce. The study contributes valuable insights into the strategic role of HR in harmonizing educational outcomes with industry requirements, suggesting a model for leveraging human resource capabilities to fulfill the Madani Framework's aspirations. Recommendations are provided for policymakers, educators, and HR professionals to foster a collaborative, strategic approach to developing a resilient, adaptable, and employable graduate pool aligned with national development goals. © Proceedings of International Conference on Research in Education and Science 2024.

AB  - The purpose of this Literature Review is to emphasize the significance of Knowledge Management (KM) in organizations and explore ways to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) in capturing Tacit Knowledge (TK), leading to innovation in organizational learning and to investigate the impact of Organizational Culture on Knowledge sharing among employees in the organization. The review is based on academic sources and scholarly research examining existing theories and frameworks in AI and TK. The key findings suggest that humans remain irreplaceable in capturing TK, emphasizing the significance of Human-AI collaboration to embed a culture of continuous learning and drive innovation in organizations. The limitations of the literature review are the limited availability of research in the context of AI in capturing TK. A precise knowledge gap has been identified in transparent methodologies in capturing TK which shows the need for conducting future research in this context. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Empirical studies on agency in green path development (GPD) have underexplored non-firm actors' roles. Through a semi-structured interview, this article provides insight into how the City of Vaasa exercises agency toward developing the battery industry and the concomitant effects. The findings reveal that the City of Vaasa provides place-based leadership, for example, through a local-based initiative, that is, the GigaVaasa, as a platform to increase participation and coordinate the actions of public and private actors. As an institutional entrepreneur, they govern the issuance of operating licenses to optimize their economic interest; as innovative entrepreneur, they strategically plan and coordinate infrastructure development to increase the region's attractiveness to external investors and talents. The City of Vaasa agency increases the chances for the region to participate in the global battery market and stimulate the region's economic development. Nonetheless, environmental sustainability concerns remain a profound unintended effect. Conceptually, the article introduces the agency cyclicality and synchronization model to enhance the understanding of the interplay and effect of agency in an emerging green industry's development trajectory. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Research into the factors influencing university-industry collaboration on public university spin-offs creation has focused on management, entrepreneurship, technology and innovation. This research began with a careful systematic literature review of 4427 scientific papers published in the last ten years (2014–2023) and accessible in the prestigious Web of Science core collection. A quantitative methodology was used, complemented by the use of the visual analysis tool Posit PBC™, formerly known as R Cloud Studio. This comprehensive approach facilitated the seamless ingestion of raw data into Biblioshyni, which is a web-based platform specialised in bibliometric analysis. This review has revealed compelling trends, particularly in terms of increasing diversity, the emergence of United Kingdom as a major player, and the central role of university-industry collaboration. Our systematic review identified influential authors in the field, including the prolific contributions of scholars such as D. Radicid, S. Ropers, Y. Li and R. Owen. We also identified important research institutions, such as Utrecht University in Netherlands, Lund University in Sweden and The University of Manchester in the UK. In addition, we have shown that countries such as the United Kingdom, China and USA have made a significant contribution to the volume of publications. The results highlighted a marked increase in the phenomenon of univeristy spin-offs over the past decade, as evidenced by the exponential growth in both publication output and citation rates. This empirical revelation was underpinned by a rigorous exploration of the Web of Science database, using a carefully crafted set of keywords. Thirty-seven pivotal studies were selected for in-depth review through a sophisticated selection process that adhered to the rigorous standards of the PRISMA methodology. The aim of this review is to improve understanding and encourage deeper exploration of spin-off-based public universities through collaboration between academia and industry. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Cooperation in research, development and innovation (RD&I) between universities or research institutes and industries plays a fundamental role in the economic development of a country. Industry benefits from state-of-the-art laboratories and technologies from academia, while institutes learn about business reality and market needs. Numerous barriers to the establishment and maintenance of these partnerships have been investigated and reported in the literature, but the information generated by these empirical studies is very fragmented and there is a need to consider the barriers systematically in order to clarify the topic. The aims of this systematic review were to analyze university-industry collaborations set up for the purpose of RD&I in an effort to recognize the barriers and facilitators of the process and to identify the approaches by which such barriers may be overcome. Following searches of the Scopus database and application of the exclusion criteria, 86 relevant articles were identified and submitted to bibliometric analysis. Subsequently, 75 articles were selected for in-depth content analysis, and the ideas embodied therein were presented in a structured and comprehensive manner. Barriers were evaluated according to three different theoretical perspectives, namely the triple helix and the entrepreneurial university, the relational social capital and value creation, and technology transfer and cultural differences. The facilitators were categorized as internal and external. The results obtained highlight the importance of fostering relational social capital and providing tax incentives to facilitate industry's pursuit of innovation through academia partnerships, and also show that collaborative barriers in RD&I may be overcome to some extent by starting with smaller projects and gradually increasing their complexity. Based on the findings outlined in this review, we propose various lines for future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - For centuries, the collaboration between higher education and industry (or academic engagement) has become an exciting topic for all related stakeholders, such as researchers, policymakers, or entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, there has yet to be any comprehensive understanding of the extant literature on this topic. Motivated by this gap, this study applies the bibliometric method to review all related documents of academic engagement indexed in the Scopus database between 1978 and 2021. The results showed that the period from 2018 to 2021 identified itself as a golden era with the palpable attention of scholars who contributed to approximately 80% of the related topic. The countries ranked in the top five with dominant publications include the US, the UK, Spain, Italy and Germany. The co-word analysis also recognized technology transfer, research and development, and entrepreneurial university and university-industry relations as the key topics focused on academic engagement works of literature. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The university is a key actor in the creation of knowledge that must respond to global transformations by meeting the demands of different interest groups, which has led to its management becoming a complex activity. The aim of this paper is to present the trends in university governance, strategy and management through the review of the Clarivate-Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases with the support of Vosviewer software. The results have made it possible to identify three perspectives: A) governance and leadership models, b) student body in university governance, quality of service and student entrepreneurship, and c) technology in higher education. For its part, the United Kingdom stands out as the country with the highest scientific production in this area. Finally, the study allows us to conclude that the changes that university management systems have undergone and the relevance that elements such as ICTs, the relationship with business, peer review processes and student participation have acquired within it, reflecting the most relevant factors of the evolution of governance systems in connection with the new dynamics that will guide us towards an entrepreneurial university. © 2024, null.

AB  - This study aims to explore the barriers of innovation in one of ASEAN developing countries particularly Brunei Darussalam. This research focuses on 3 sectors which are from 1) the government of Brunei to 2) the higher education institutions particularly Universiti Teknologi Brunei to 3) industry sectors in Brunei Darussalam - primarily in the processes of technology transfer. Using the Triple Helix theory model, barriers were identified between consecutive sectors. In this study, qualitative research methods have been utilized (case studies using interview methods) and a total of 9 main barriers have been identified between the sectors from the literature review which were then studied exclusively in the setting of Brunei. Identifying these barriers and its gap which is to identify the interrelationships between the barriers would provide a greater understanding into the complex nature of the innovation and technology transfer process, which can be considered as a valuable input towards crucial national and individuals' decision making. The study addresses this gap by determining innovation barriers in the Triple Helix Model and their intertwined relationships. The objective also seeks to comprehend the factors that contribute to successful technology transfer and to suggest the effectiveness that might be attained by enhancing technology transfer to universities, industry, and the government. The findings from the interviews are rather interesting as the reasoning for most barriers are different from other nations in the literature review. Despite this, the barriers have not been successfully addressed. This necessitates an evaluation of the government's strategy for achieving “Wawasan 2035”. © 2024 University of Brunei Darussalam.

AB  - This study aims to identify and explain different collaborative approaches, delineate external actors' roles, and examine the interplay between knowledge exploration and exploitation processes for digital transformation. We conducted a search of academic papers using research terms such as “Digital*, Digital transfor*, industry 4.0 (I4.0), industry 5.0, knowledge exploration, knowledge acquisition, ecosystem collaboration*, knowledge networks, and open innovation” in both the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Altogether, 108 papers met the criteria (e.g., ABS 2 & 2+ ranking of journals, only journal papers, and focusing on small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) digital transformation) for conducting a systematic literature review in this research. The results indicate that external actors play specific roles in supporting SMEs' digital transformation. We found that customers and suppliers push and encourage SMEs in their digital transformation, while coopetition can elicit greater technological benefits for SMEs with close technological and economic proximity. Intermediaries provide knowledge-brokering services, facilitate innovation processes, and enable technology transfer and capacity-building for SMEs’ digital transformation. Government initiatives, such as favorable policymaking and financial support, are important in promoting and facilitating a collaborative environment for technology development among SMEs. This study's results present two distinct collaborative mechanisms that SMEs can utilize for digital transformation: (I) core value chain and network actors’ collaborations, which provide linear processes for knowledge exploration and exploitation, and (II) ecosystem and innovation platform-based collaborations, in which SMEs adopt the ambidextrous approach as a nonlinear process for knowledge exploration and exploitation for digital transformation. Certain organizational-level factors (organizational capabilities, micro-foundations, operational capabilities, organization strategies, and culture) are important for SMEs’ knowledge exploitation in digital transformation. The study also presents an integrated framework and offers directions for future research and important insights for practitioners. © 2025

AB  - Over the last four decades, innovation capability has been studied to examine the innovation phenomenon based on the specific characteristics of organizations and systems under the theory of resources and capabilities. However, "capability" has diverse applications, and its correlation with innovation remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the definition of "innovation capability" in the context of the manufacturing industry and to comprehend how researchers presently investigate this concept. In order to meet this, an exhaustive search was conducted in the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases, covering the period from 2018 to 2023. The selection of documents for analysis was determined by applying the scientometric method. The authors of this research identified 462 documents, and the bibliometric analysis, conducted using VOS viewer and Bibliometrix tools, revealed four main thematic areas within the research domain: sustainability, business performance, technology transfer, and knowledge management. As a result, this study identified the seminal authors of the concept. It provided a precise definition of "innovation capability", highlighting the significant interest that this research topic arouses in current academic literature. © 2024 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

AB  - [Purpose/Significance] In today's society, driven primarily by innovation, universities have placed unprecedented emphasis on the cultivation of innovative talent through innovation and entrepreneurship courses. This study aims to systematically review, integrate, and analyze the domain of innovation and entrepreneurship courses using visual knowledge mapping technology, providing the academic community with a comprehensive examination of the current state of research in this field. We hope these findings will offer valuable references and guidance for future research and practice in innovation and entrepreneurship education. [Methods] This study employs CiteSpace visualization software for comprehensive bibliometric analysis of core academic literature spanning 19 years[1]. The detailed literature interpretation not only outlines the research trajectory in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship courses but also elucidates key research topics and prominent hotspots[11]. By systematically integrating innovation and entrepreneurship courses, this study delves into their structure, research focuses, and current frontier topics, providing a theoretical foundation and guiding future academic inquiries and practical applications[10]. [Results/Conclusions] Research on university innovation and entrepreneurship courses has matured into a well-developed field and exhibits new trends. The study reveals that prior to 2016, the number of academic papers related to this field grew slowly, but post-2017, there was a noticeable surge. Among the top 20 institutions by publication volume, 18 are from the United States, with the UK and France each contributing two, reflecting the dominant position of the US in this research field and indicating significant research strength and influence from the UK and France. According to keyword evolution sequences, research themes mainly include curriculum system construction, entrepreneurship research, innovation research, teaching model innovation reform, and artificial intelligence. Recently, information technology, big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have become new research hotspots, showing increasing research attention in these areas.  © 2024 ACM.

AB  - The aim of this systematic literature review was to understand the features, and the evolution, of industrial doctorates by analysing 54 papers published between 2002 and 2023. Two aspects were considered (i) the state of the art of the literature has been clarified through synthesis and discussion of six key themes: the main features and evolution of industrial doctorates; the design and implementation of industrial PhD programmes; the perspective of PhD candidates; the standpoint of university; the standpoint of industry; and industrial doctorates as policy tools for fostering innovation processes. There was a surge in publications after 2015, but these have mainly focused on the European context. Industrial doctorates are reshaping the doctoral education landscape as they are considered as educational tools for building bridges between academia and industry. However, there are still institutional and cultural barriers to legitimising industrial doctorates which are often considered as alternatives or even as the antithesis of ‘traditional’ PhDs; (ii) we suggest an agenda for future research to assess whether industrial doctorates do offer an effective response, or an optimal approach to meeting the demands of both the knowledge society and of doctoral candidates. Future research should seek to gather quantitative evidence in a wider variety of geographical areas, taking into account the distinctive features of both institutional contexts, and of the diverse scientific fields and industrial sectors involved. Studies of the long-term impacts of industrial doctorates on students’ research outcomes, their career trajectories and, on the performance of local ecosystems are needed. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on University-Industry Collaboration (UIC) in Vietnam, marking the first systematic examination of practice-based studies within the country. Our review aims to identify key forms and factors influencing UIC implementation in Vietnam, recommending future directions and highlighting key facilitators. Following the PRISMA 2009 guidelines, we identified 256 research papers across four databases (Web of Science, ERIC, ProQuest, and Google Scholar), ultimately selecting 25 papers after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and conducting duplicate removal. Thematic and inductive qualitative content analysis methods were employed to address the review question, revealing observed forms of UIC in Vietnam, including sponsorship, internships, licensing, knowledge transfer, and cooperative recruitment. Influencing factors encompass 10 elements. Our review identifies deficiencies in UIC implementation and suggests potential areas for future development. These findings pave the way for exploring innovative UIC strategies amidst industrialization and globalization. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Enterprise System Projects (ESPs) are fundamental enablers of digital transformation across organizations, yet they consistently suffer from high failure rates, often attributed to ineffective Knowledge Transfer (KT) practices. Despite the critical role of KT in ensuring project sustainability and long-term organizational learning, limited scholarly attention has been given to identifying and systematically categorizing the success factors that influence KT outcomes in ESPs. The aim of this study is to investigate and conceptualize the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that influence effective knowledge transfer in ESPs. To address this research gap, a mixed-methods approach is used, combining a literature review with empirical insights from semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners involved in large-scale ESP implementations. The analysis reveals a set of interrelated CSFs that significantly impact KT effectiveness. Some of the key points highlighted are the shared knowledge between cultures, the high expertise of consultants based on technicality and social skills, and the solid and visible management support. These points are integrated into a conceptual framework that enhances conceptual understanding while offering practitioners practical guidance. The study contributes by bridging the gap between the KT concept and ESP implementation, which are connected to the academic discourse, proposing a comprehensive model for successful knowledge transfer during the deployment of ESP. From a practical standpoint, the findings offer organizations a strategic lens to design and implement KT mechanisms that enhance project outcomes and ensure long-term knowledge retention. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - Cross-border transfer and the protection of knowledge are important for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to develop their network partners’ capabilities while simultaneously safeguarding competitive advantages. However, they can be challenging for MNEs due to cultural and institutional differences between home and host markets. This poses a dilemma for MNEs, which is how to strike a balance between their knowledge transfer (KT) and knowledge protection (KP) strategies. It is notable that, so far, research has primarily investigated these two areas independently, lacking an integrative view. Therefore, in this article, we reviewed 98 academic articles exploring knowledge transfer/protection in MNEs operating under international joint venture (IJV) arrangements and assessed publications from the last two decades (2000–2022). Drawing from institutional theory and the bargaining power perspective, we developed a conceptual framework highlighting the external and internal factors influencing KT and KP. Subsequently, we contextualized these factors within the specific domain of IJVs, drawing on insights gleaned from the studies in our sample. The interplay of these factors, along with their contextual nuances, provides a holistic and in-depth understanding of how knowledge is managed within the complex dynamics of IJVs. In addition, our review contributes to our understanding of knowledge management in MNEs by identifying novel gaps in the literature and suggesting a number of avenues for future research. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Cultural differences among the stakeholders in the university-industry collaboration space are highlighted as one of the most important barriers in the technology transfer (TT) process. The Technology Transfer Office (TTO) emerges as an important bridging institution dealing with them. Starting with a systematic literature review, this study identifies research addressing the topic of TTO and culture. It analyses, through a case study, the main characteristics of the organizational culture of a well-established and successful TTO using the Competing Values Framework. Results show that only limited scientific work emphasizes the nature of organizational culture of the TTO. In addition, the empirical findings show that the culture of the TTO should be an inclusive one spanning an interrelated and ambiguous set of cultural characteristics that embrace the culture of its various stakeholders in a pragmatic, professional, and service-oriented manner. In doing so the TTO bridges information and interpretation asymmetries among its multiple stakeholders. © The author/s, 2025.

AB  - Purpose: Academic scholars have tested students’ entrepreneurial intention (SEI) through the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Still, the link between entrepreneurial intention and career is missing in previous studies. An extensive literature review developed the rationale that existing theories in the entrepreneurial discipline have limitations in linking entrepreneurial intention with career. This research is conducted to develop a comprehensive model for the relationship between entrepreneurial university support, student entrepreneurial intention, behavior and career. Stimulus-Organism-Behavior-Consequence (SOBC) paradigm from organizational behavior research is borrowed to entrepreneurship literature. Design/methodology/approach: The cross-sectional data was collected from Pakistani university students enrolled in business incubators. A sample of 100 responses was tested with a partial least square–structural equation modelling approach. Findings: The study established that by the underpinning of SOBC, entrepreneurial university support influences students’ entrepreneurial intention. It is also found that the students’ entrepreneurial intention strongly influences their entrepreneurial behavior, leading them to entrepreneurship careers. Research limitations/implications: The policies influencing students’ entrepreneurial intention and behavior can be developed using the SOBC paradigm. Higher education institutions can improve students’ entrepreneurial intentions and behavior to lead them to entrepreneurship careers. Originality/value: This research introduced the SOBC paradigm in entrepreneurial intention and behavior literature. SOBC underpinning explored a new dimension of entrepreneurial intention and behavior literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The predominant empirical focus of academic entrepreneurship research has been in the science, technology and engineering domains. To date there has been a limited research and empirical focus on academic entrepreneurship in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS). This is against a background of the growing societal and policy recognition of the important contributions and impact of HASS based research. The purpose of this paper through a systematic literature review is to examine the current state of academic entrepreneurship research in HASS. Our systematic literature identified four key themes namely, actors,barriers,mechanismsandmeasurementandevaluation. From this, we develop and outline a research agenda for academic entrepreneurship in HASS. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Academic spin-offs drive regional development through science-based innovation, yet the knowledge of their emergence is still plagued by contradictory findings due to its poor grounding in theory. This paper, through a systematic literature review, re-reads spin-off emergence as an organization-embedded dynamic using the lens of social information processing theory. Based on a thematic analysis that returns four conceptual themes (entrepreneurial university, institutional factors, human capital, and cognitive and psychological factors) a multi-level conceptual framework is proposed showing that both individual-level factors and elements of the university context have an effect, although in different ways, on the spin-off emergence dynamics. In recognizing spin-off formation as a complex and organization-embedded process of venture emergence, we further emphasize the need to complement driver identification with complexity-sensitive perspectives on organizational novelty. Building on these findings, we propose a research agenda emphasizing three open issues: (i) understanding the drivers of spin-off emergence, (ii) unpacking the processual perspectives on spin-off emergence, and (iii) disentangling the interplay between individual-level and university-level factors. Theoretical contributions to academic entrepreneurship and practical implications for university policy are discussed. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Practitioner-focused research syntheses are widely used in many disciplines as an effective, routine means to transfer knowledge from research to practice. We suggest that accounting academics develop research skills to enable them to create a practitioner-responsive research synthesis. We provide a step-by-step primer for conducting and reporting results on a focal research question in a research synthesis. We draw from our experience in creating a practitioner-validated research synthesis on issues related to group audits to illustrate the process concretely. This paper addresses the mindset necessary to assemble and convey research findings relevant to practitioners. Our goal is to equip accounting researchers with tools to develop high-quality research syntheses comparable to those that other disciplines use in communicating with their practitioner communities. © 2025, American Accounting Association.

AB  - Leadership continuity is essential for maintaining organizational performance, strategic stability, and long-term competitiveness. Nevertheless, many organizations encounter challenges during leadership transitions, often due to inadequate succession planning, insufficient leadership development frameworks, and the diminishing of organizational memory. This conceptual paper examines the relationship between succession planning, leadership development, and organizational memory. Succession planning enables organizations to proactively identify and prepare future leaders, thereby minimizing disruptions resulting from leadership changes. Leadership development is focused on systematically equipping high-potential employees with the essential skills, competencies, and experiences needed to step into leadership roles. Additionally, organizational memory—composed of institutional knowledge, historical insights, and experiential learning—plays a crucial role in safeguarding strategic knowledge and leadership expertise during transitions. The integration of these three components creates a robust leadership pipeline, reduces the risks associated with leadership voids, and fortifies the retention of institutional knowledge. This paper provides a critical analysis of existing literature concerning executive transitions, talent management, and knowledge retention, aiming to establish interlinks among these variables. The study emphasizes how organizations can utilize structured mentorship programs, knowledge transfer strategies, and leadership development initiatives to facilitate seamless leadership transitions. Furthermore, it addresses the obstacles to effective leadership continuity, such as short-term mindsets in succession planning, the failure to institutionalize leadership knowledge, and resistance to leadership changes. This conceptual paper adds value to both academic research and managerial practices by synthesizing insights from human resource management, strategic leadership, and organizational behavior. The findings highlight the necessity for organizations to embrace a comprehensive approach to leadership continuity, integrating succession planning, leadership development, and organizational memory into a unified strategy. The paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers, HR professionals, and corporate leaders on promoting sustainable leadership transitions in dynamic and competitive environments. © 2025 by the author; licensee Learning Gate.

Emphasising the urgent need for in-depth exploration of the implementation of entrepreneurship education. Methods. A systematic literature review serves as a basis for summarising publications in a particular field of study. Systematic literature review using the method, which consists of five different stages. These stages include defining eligibility criteria, describing sources of information, literature selection, data collection, and selection of data items. This method proves advantageous as it can serve as a starting point or proposal for further research and analysis. Results. Among the 31 papers carefully selected for analysis, two prominent themes emerged: the implementation of entrepreneurship education programs and the development of entrepreneurial learning within Indonesian entrepreneurial universities. Most of the extensively selected articles focus on these themes. This research examines student entrepreneurial competence, mentoring, and various forms of entrepreneurial learning within the framework of higher education in Indonesia. Conclusion. In reviewing the landscape of Indonesia’s higher education entrepreneurship curriculum, it becomes clear that while strides have been made, significant challenges remain. The uniqueness of Indonesia’s demographics, coupled with economic dynamics, underscores the urgency of fostering entrepreneurship education. Despite growing demand, research reveals deficiencies in the effectiveness of current programs, emphasising the need for comprehensive research. The dearth of English-language scientific literature and publications requires innovative approaches, such as categorising accessible digital resources, to gather insights into common practice. © 2024, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

AB  - The development of ion exchange chromatography to polish biopharmaceuticals requires extensive experimental benchmarking. As part of the Design of Experiments (DoE), statistical models increased efficiency somewhat and are still state of the art; however, the capability to predict process conditions is limited due to their nature as interpolating models. Applying the DoE still requires numerous experiments and is constrained to the design space, posing a risk of missing the potential optimum. To make a leap in model-based process development, applying extrapolating models can tremendously extend the design space and also allow for process understanding and knowledge transfer. While existing chromatography modeling software explains experimental data, it often lacks predictive power for new conditions. In academic–industrial cooperation, we demonstrate a new high-fidelity model based on biophysics for developing ion-exchange chromatography in biomanufacturing, making it a general tool in rationalizing process development for the present demand of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies and the emerging demand of new modalities. Using the new computational tool, we achieved predictability and attained high accuracy; with minimal experimental effort to calibrate the system, the mathematical model predicted sensitive process conditions, and even described product-related impurities, antibody charge variants. Thus, the computational tool can be deployed for process-by-design and material-by-design approaches. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background: There is widespread enthusiasm for scaling interventions to strengthen health systems. However, little is known about the scalability of such interventions in Africa. In this study, we seek to assess the scalability of interventions for improving the functionality of health systems in Africa, as a key to large-scale implementation strategy of interventions with potential for impact. Methods: The study will deploy a multi-pronged approach, grounded in an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) approach. First, a multidisciplinary steering committee will be established, involving key female and male stakeholders in all stages of our study from its inception and as equal members of the research team for overseeing the project. Second, as part of the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method, evidence from a published systematic review will be used to develop the African Scalability Assessment Framework (AFROSAF), a series of multiple attributes for assessing the ability to scale a health system intervention in Africa. Third, the content of the AFROSAF will be validated using Delphi survey (within a deliberative dialogue) following the Lavis’ framework for knowledge transfer and a conceptual framework developed by Boyko et al. a multi-stakeholder consensus exercise with experts from Africa will be convened. The Likert scaled scalability attributes developed will be rated and descriptive statistics and hierarchical cluster analysis will be used to synthesize the data. Finally, document analyses will be conducted to rate to which extent each intervention has data that meet criteria responding to the essential components of scalability using the AFROSAF. We will conduct an analysis to score and rank each intervention for scalability. Discussion: This project proposes an approach aiming to catalyse the scale of interventions for effective functionality of health systems in Africa. The process will yield a scalability assessment tool for Africa and inventory scalable interventions. The findings will help African countries and policymakers understand the parameters to use and assess health system interventions for scaling. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: Alternative transportation programs are widely promoted as a viable strategy for prevention of alcohol-impaired driving (AID) and crashes, with ride-sharing and safe-ride being two major approaches. The scientific literature on these programs frequently uses the terms “ride-sharing” and “safe-ride” interchangeably, though their meaning is not synonymous. This critical review set out to clarify the main characteristics of these programs to advance research, dissemination of the findings, and knowledge transfer in the alternative transportation field for AID and crash prevention. Method: A systematic literature search of six databases using the PRISMA-S checklist identified studies of ride-sharing and safe-ride programs to prevent AID or crashes. Inclusion criteria comprised studies published in academic and gray literature between 1980 and 2023. A six-step thematic analysis of included studies identified the defining characteristics of each program. Results: The 32 included studies evaluated for-profit ride-sharing/ride-hailing programs (n = 21) and safe-ride programs (n = 11). No studies on non-profit ride-sharing programs were identified. Analyses revealed two main themes. Operational strategies were most important for distinguishing between for-profit ride-sharing and safe-ride programs, with differences in these subthemes: purpose (revenue generation vs. AID reduction), management (private vs. private plus other strategies), funding (self-financing vs. external), and promotion (convenient transportation vs. dangers of AID). Service offerings, the second theme, highlighted differences in program costs, availability, accessibility, service capacity, coverage, and types of vehicles used. Discussion: The scientific literature on ride-sharing was limited to for-profit ride-sharing, suggesting that referring to them as “ride-hailing” in future studies would be more accurate. Both operational strategies and service offerings highlight the advantages and disadvantages of ride-hailing and safe-ride programs in the context of AID. Some programs referred to as ride-sharing programs have the same operational strategies as safe-ride programs, suggesting these be classified as safe-ride programs for conceptual coherence. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - During summer of 2023, two capstone instructors in mechanical engineering at Ohio State University set about redesigning the capstone course to offer students an experience that would expose them to the world of product design and development, and infuse a design mindset to their engineering activities. To redesign the course, the instructors participated in a “course design institute” through Ohio State University's Michael V. Drake Institute for Teaching and Learning in May of 2023. The month-long program let the instructors through the Backward Design Process. This process allows instructors to first identify desired student outcomes and then design the course around those desired results. It should be noted that this bears a striking resemblance to user-centered design, a core tenet of this capstone course, in which designers strive to first understand their stakeholders before designing a solution. Employing the backward design process, the instructors first developed broad learning goals for the capstone course, which described what students would know how to do and what they would care about upon completing the two-semester capstone sequence. Next, the instructors identified learning outcomes, which describe what the students would be expected to know or formally do. This effort was followed by identifying assessment techniques and filling in the course's content. Key aspects of the design mindset which were infused in this new course included: being inquisitive and open, being empathetic to others' needs, being accepting of ambiguity, questioning critically, and a proclivity to taking purposeful action. The two instructors involved in this redesign both have experience in the industry of product design and development, and aimed to structure the course and project path to reflect many of the practices that designers and engineers might employ in the product development industry. Key practices that the instructors wanted to emphasize in the course included: research skills to gain understanding of stakeholders, contexts, and constraints relevant to a problem; a focus on problem finding & framing, rather than jumping right into a solution; developing divergent thinking to facilitate fluent and fruitful concept brainstorming; building communication skills beyond technical writing, to include visual communication and the importance of storytelling. This paper will share a review of literature relevant to factors surrounding a design mindset and how a design mindset can impact design practice in the world of product development. Additionally, this paper will share benchmarking of best practices from the product design and development industry. This paper will discuss the implementation of this new capstone course during the 2023-24 academic year. Future discussion will include: • Summary of student outcomes • Instructor reflection on implementation • Comparison of standard course evaluations from the first course in the sequence (comparing previous iterations of the course vs. current iteration) • Reflection from students on their experience with specific learning outcomes • Reflection from students on the value and utility of certain exercises and skills. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.

AB  - University-Industry Collaboration (UIC) represents a vital pathway for cultivating high-caliber talent. However, insufficient enterprise motivation in UIC persists as a fundamental challenge in practice, significantly impacting collaboration quality and effectiveness. While this issue demands attention, related research remains in preliminary stages. Through systematic literature review and empirical investigation of UIC practices, this study employs grounded theory to analyze the inducing factors, behavioral manifestations, behavioral effects, and coping strategies associated with insufficient enterprise motivation. The findings reveal a theoretical framework comprising four major categories (inducing factors, behavioral manifestations, behavioral effects, and coping strategies) and twelve initial categories. Insufficient enterprise motivation gradually emerges through the interplay of symbiotic subject factors (such as inadequate innovation capacity and strategic planning), symbiotic environmental factors (including policy and institutional environment and market competition), and symbiotic mechanism factors (such as benefit distribution and risk-sharing mechanisms). This motivational deficiency manifests in multiple dimensions, including inadequate strategic planning, declining participation enthusiasm, lack of emotional investment, and reduced resource allocation. The behavioral effects are both significant and complex, negatively influencing enterprises' willingness to participate and decision-making processes. Countermeasures can be approached from three dimensions: enhancing symbiotic subjects, optimizing symbiotic environments, and perfecting symbiotic mechanisms. This research not only enriches the theoretical framework in the UIC field but also provides theoretical support and practical guidance for stimulating enterprise participation and improving UIC effectiveness. © 2025 The Author

AB  - The integration of blockchain technology into higher learning institutions (HLIs) holds the potential to revolutionize data management, enhance transparency, and improve trust in academic systems. However, the effective adoption of blockchain requires a comprehensive and valid model that addresses the specific needs and contexts of HLIs. This study aims to assess the content validity of the Knowledge Integration Model for Blockchain in Higher Learning Institutions using Aiken’s V method. The proposed model was developed through a systematic literature review and refined with expert input. Content validity was evaluated by seven experts with backgrounds in education, blockchain technology, and information systems. Each item within the model was rated for its relevance, clarity, and representativeness using a Likert scale. The instrument, consisting of 50 items across six constructs, was evaluated by seven domain experts using Aiken’s V methodology. Each item was rated based on its relevance and clarity using a 5-point Likert scale. The results revealed that out of 50 items, 21 required revision or removal due to low Aiken’s V scores (<0.70), 21 were deemed acceptable but required minor revisions, and 8 demonstrated strong content validity (V ≥ 0.80). These findings underscore the importance of expert evaluation in refining research instruments and ensuring construct alignment. The use of Aiken’s V provided a robust quantitative foundation for the validation process. The refined instrument serves as a reliable tool for assessing institutional readiness and knowledge integration capabilities in the context of blockchain adoption. This work contributes to the growing research on educational blockchain implementation by offering a validated framework that can support empirical investigations and strategic decision-making in higher education. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - In the context of rapid technological advancement and the global rise of entrepreneurship, business incubators have become essential mechanisms for supporting technology-based startups, particularly in emerging economies. These incubators play a strategic role in bridging resource gaps, fostering innovation, and enhancing the survival and growth of early-stage ventures. Despite their increasing importance, there remains a limited understanding of how incubator performance directly influences startup outcomes. This study addresses that gap through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 920 scholarly articles published between 2010 and 2022, sourced from Scopus and Google Scholar. Using VOSviewer, the analysis identifies key research trends, influential publications, and thematic clusters related to incubator performance. The findings reveal a significant increase in research activity over the past decade, with a peak in 2018, and a strong concentration of publications in journals focused on technology transfer and innovation management. Prominent themes include academic entrepreneurship, incubator performance, technology transfer offices, and the role of innovation ecosystems involving academia, industry, and government. These themes highlight the multifaceted nature of incubator success and the importance of cross-sector collaboration. The study also emphasizes the need for integrated evaluation frameworks to enhance incubator effectiveness and guide institutional and policy-level strategies. The novelty of this research lies in its synthesis of bibliometric insights to propose future research directions and methodological improvements for assessing incubator performance. By mapping the intellectual landscape of incubator research, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how incubators can be optimized to support sustainable startup development and economic growth in emerging markets. © 2025 Authors.

AB  - There is a wealth of literature on the relationship between the university and sustainability, but research is still lacking in terms of activating and enhancing its efficiency. Through a literature review, identifying research papers, and conducting an in-depth content analysis of 34 papers, the relationships between the university, sustainability, and academic entrepreneurship were established. Furthermore, a distinction was made between hard and soft research activities, along with the mechanisms that need to be generated within the university to facilitate development. Various types of academic entrepreneurship related to sustainability were identified. Based on the findings, a model is proposed to enhance the dynamism and effectiveness of sustainable academic entrepreneurship in universities. A research agenda is also proposed. © 2024 Community Development Society.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of a research study focused on industry-university collaborations within the design studio culture. The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, including a literature review and case studies, to investigate and identify lessons learned from university-industry collaborations for interior design students. Two industry-university collaborations within AU were selected as case studies based on their relevance to the design courses offered in the BSID program. The case studies employed a mixed-methods approach, involving non-participant observations, students’ reflection reports, and semi-structured interviews with instructors and industry staff members. This research contributes to the understanding of industry-university collaborations within design studio culture and provides valuable insights for instructors, universities, and industry partners seeking to engage in such collaborations. By highlighting the experiences of instructors at AU, we aim to provide insights into the benefits and challenges of industry-university collaborations for universities that are new to such partnerships. The findings include the importance of embracing exposure and new partnerships, providing real-world experience, balancing autonomy and dependence, understanding the limitations of scope, considering the scale and limitations, navigating bureaucratic procedures, mitigating conflicting interests, adhering to regulations and guidelines, emphasizing positive social impact, and learning from limitations. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Introduction: Empirical evidence has confirmed that all types of knowledge (propositional, procedural, personal, and client) contribute to evidence-based practice (EBP) and should be transferred in clinical practice to inform quality service delivery. However, it is unclear how the integration of the types of knowledge that are transferred in clinical practice manifests. Given this gap in understanding, the current research sought to build a conceptual map of knowledge transfer in clinical practice in central South Africa. Method: A qualitative approach was followed, and data to build the conceptual map was obtained from a scoping review that explored the landscape of knowledge transfer in occupational therapy clinical practice, nine semistructured interviews with occupational therapists working in central South Africa, and a Q Method survey. Results: The conceptual map–building process delivered a multidimensional, multidirectional conceptual map consisting of four concepts (theory and research, practice experience, patient–therapist relationship, and patient’s voice in clinical practice) and four types of knowledge (propositional, procedural, personal, and client). The results show the integration of the types of knowledge and confirm that knowledge transfer in clinical practice is a complex and ongoing process. Conclusion: The conceptual map, a first of its kind in South Africa, presents empirical evidence of knowledge that is created and transferred in clinical practice in central South Africa. The conceptual map might provide a framework for collaboration amongst all stakeholders, such as patients, occupational therapists, and academics, to produce practice guidelines and occupational outcome measures to support evidence-based clinical practice.

AB  - This paper analyses from a gender perspective a pilot call for evaluating academics and researcher transfer and innovation activities, launched by the Spanish Government in 2018, known as the “Knowledge Transfer & Innovation Sexennium” (KT&IS). Not only women's participation was much lower than that of men (1 woman applicant for every 3 men applicants), but also, they showed lower success rates than men in all scientific fields, with an average gap of more than 13 points. The methodology combined an exploratory quantitative analysis of the almost 17,000 applications, with a meta-evaluative qualitative analysis through interviews to key actors of the evaluation program and focus groups with evaluators. Hidden biases operating throughout and in each of the different phases of the KT&IS evaluation process were identified. This article aims at contributing to how economic and social impact of research can be fairly and fully evaluated, as well as at facilitating the design of future evaluation calls that promote the effective advancement of gender equality in all science-related activities and transfer to society. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Research on intermediaries facilitating university–industry collaboration (UIC) has grown substantially in recent decades. However, existing reviews predominantly focus on intermediaries supporting commercialization, neglecting those facilitating university–industry research partnerships, another distinct UIC channel that involves deeper interactions and the exchange of tacit knowledge. Given the fragmented state of the relevant literature, we perform a systematic review to provide a coherent understanding of intermediaries in research partnerships. Five types of intermediaries operating at organizational and individual levels emerge through reviewing 69 articles. We contribute by (1) proposing a process model outlining their roles and activities across partnership stages and (2) presenting a framework that discerns partnership development- and partnership participants-related consequences of intermediary involvement and categorizes factors affecting their effectiveness into internal, external, and inter-organizational levels. Based on integrated insights, we formulate a future research agenda in seven areas and discuss practical implications for leveraging intermediaries to catalyze partnership development. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Abstract: Influenced by the neo-liberal economic perspective, in which universities are evaluated based on their contribution to society, the term “Entrepreneurial University” (EU) emerged in the early 1980s. The entrepreneurial university has evolved as a “natural” incubator supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and sustainability in the university community (e.g., students, alumni, staff, and academics) and beyond civic engagement. Over the last four decades, academic debates on why and how higher education organizations could play this key role have become increasingly important in the business and management literature. It has motivated several special issues published in multidisciplinary academic journals, literature reviews, and theoretical-empirical contributions. However, there is a defragmentation of the literature given the unique nature of each entrepreneurial university during the current decade and the forced transformation of entrepreneurial organizations due to new (technological and health) paradigms. Therefore, this new decade opens the door for re-viewing the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence of entrepreneurial universities. Inspired by these universities’ challenges, this special issue represented a unique opportunity to build a novel theory that provides an updated theoretical view of the entrepreneurial university phenomenon (e.g., re-conceptualization, re-view missions, re-view business models, re-view metrics), as well as to offer new insights about how the new paradigms have transformed core entrepreneurial university activities (education, research, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship), strategies, and interconnectedness with ecosystems. This introductory paper encouraged an in-depth multidisciplinary conversation within the management and related research community from different socio-economic settings to make theoretical and empirical contributions. As a result, six papers have contributed to this special issue and provide several implications for different stakeholders. Plain English Summary: Over the last four decades, academic debates on why and how higher education organizations could play this key role have become increasingly important in the business and management literature. It has motivated several special issues published in multidisciplinary academic journals, literature reviews, and theoretical-empirical contributions. However, there is a defragmentation of the literature given the unique nature of each entrepreneurial university during the current decade and the forced transformation of entrepreneurial organizations due to new (technological and health) paradigms.

AB  - Although educational systems worldwide recognize Formative Assessment (FA) practices as a cornerstone of high-quality instruction, it remains unclear what characteristics professional development programs need to impact teachers’ FA practices and students’ learning outcomes. This systematic review aimed to fill this gap by systematically identifying, describing and analyzing the available evidence. To be included, studies had to a) focus on primary or secondary teachers, b) report on a professional development program targeted at improving FA practices, c) measure teachers’ FA practices and d) represent an interventional study. We identified 23 eligible reports including quantitative and qualitative studies and extracted data on teacher and professional development program characteristics, outcomes and impact evidence. Our findings revealed that 69.56 % of professional development programs emphasized providing feedback to students, while less than 8.70 % included implementing rubrics, progress monitoring and integrating formative with summative assessments as learning outcomes. Evidence on the impact of professional development programs on teachers’ FA practices was very heterogeneous, consisting of only four studies with an intervention-control group design and 15 single group comparisons with diverse measurements including declarative, procedural and self-knowledge outcomes. Overarching topics in the qualitative evidence pointed to sources of support, difficulties, and knowledge transfer experienced by teachers in professional development programs on FA. Only six of the studies measured the impact of professional development programs on students’ learning in addition to teachers’ FA practices and almost exclusively focused on academic rather than socio-emotional outcomes. Overall, the evidence base is highly heterogeneous, showcasing the variety of approaches scholars have chosen to design, implement and measure the impact of professional development programs on FA. This heterogeneity underscores the complexity of the topic and offers insights into different components that need to be considered in future research, while representing a valuable guide for stakeholders aiming for evidence-based approaches for professional development programs on FA. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Academic expert finding has numerous advantages, such as: finding paper-reviewers, research collaboration, enhancing knowledge transfer, etc. Especially, for research collaboration, researchers tend to seek collaborators who share similar backgrounds or with the same native languages. Despite its importance, academic expert findings remain relatively unexplored within the context of Indonesian language. Recent studies have primarily relied on static word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec to match documents with relevant expertise areas. However, Word2Vec is unable to capture the varying meanings of words in different contexts. To address this research gap, this study employs Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a state-of-the-art contextual embedding model. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of BERT on the task of academic expert finding. The proposed model in this research consists of three variations of BERT, namely IndoBERT (Indonesian BERT), mBERT (Multilingual BERT), and SciBERT (Scientific BERT), which will be compared to a static embedding model using Word2Vec. Two approaches were employed to rank experts using the BERT variations: feature-based and fine-tuning. We found that the IndoBERT model outperforms the baseline by 6–9% when utilizing the feature-based approach and shows an improvement of 10–18% with the fine-tuning approach. Our results proved that the fine-tuning approach performs better than the feature-based approach, with an improvement of 1–5%. It concludes by using IndoBERT, this research has shown an improved effectiveness in the academic expert finding within the context of Indonesian language. © 2024, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

AB  - This study offers a comparative analysis of the technology transfer models in Hungary and Israel, focusing on the conversion of academic research into market-ready innovations. The research emphasizes traditional technology transfer mechanisms, particularly the roles of Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) and Technology Transfer Companies (TTCs). To assess the effectiveness of these models, apart from the literature review and secondary data analysis, six in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from Hungary and Israel. This qualitative approach provided insights into the dynamics that shape technology transfer practices, highlighting differences between the two countries' systems. Israel's technology transfer is marked by flexibility and proactive government policies. Israeli TTCs prioritize licensing over patenting, which allows for greater adaptability in commercialization. This model supports continuous innovation by enabling universities to reclaim and further develop innovations if startups fail. In contrast, Hungary's system, though evolving, tends to focus on patenting and direct commercialization, often missing opportunities for early-stage collaboration between academia and industry. The slower governmental response and weaker integration between universities and industry hinder the effectiveness of technology transfer in Hungary. The study suggests that Hungary could enhance its technology transfer framework by adopting more flexible commercialization strategies, fostering stronger university-industry collaborations, and improving governmental responsiveness. While Hungary's system differs from Israel's, elements of the Israeli model could be adapted to strengthen Hungary's technology transfer capabilities. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - This study presents a compilation and classification of humanities knowledge transfer actions from the Francisco de Vitoria University (Spain) with the aim of measuring its social impact by quantifying its recipients. A single case qualitative methodology is applied since it is the first initiative of its kind conducted by Spanish universities, as concluded from a systematic review of university websites and international scientific literature. The results show that transfer actions of humanities directly impact 99,890 people and indirectly impact 700,000 people, revealing that the number of direct recipients is ten times greater than the total number of undergraduate students at Francisco de Vitoria University in the year 2022. It is concluded that the social impact of humanities transfer actions is far greater than the number of customary university recipients reached through official in-classroom teaching. © (2024), (Centro de Informacion Tecnologica).

AB  - The German Cancer Society (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft DKG) has published a position paper to address the challenges of cancer patient care in the era of genomic medicine. The German Consortium Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC) has implemented this recommendation in its care concept for families at risk. Core elements are the outcome-oriented evaluation of structured and standardized clinical measures and reporting recommendations derived therefrom to primary care providers and patients. A cross-sector network with certified breast cancer and gynecological cancer centers was founded in 2015, starting from the Cologne Center of the GC-HBOC. To guarantee the knowledge transfer for mainstream genetic counseling, the Cologne center has established an educational program for physicians and specialized nurses in order to pilot trans-sectoral knowledge transfer on risk assessment and risk-stratified care. It consists of face-to-face lectures with written knowledge test, attending a genetic case conference and genetic counseling sessions with the opportunity to counsel under supervision. The lectures were accompanied by a structured evaluation of the participants' satisfaction and feedback of the needs in mainstream genetic counseling. Thereby, the network ensures that genetic counseling and testing is provided according to state-of-the-art knowledge and allows physicians to participate in knowledge-generating care outside the university setting and patients to receive care close to home. After multiple feedback cycles to improve the educational program, the GC-HBOC, in cooperation with the German Cancer Society, has now adopted this concept and developed a common and uniform online curriculum funded by the Federal Ministry of Health. https://www.krebsgesellschaft.de/fortbildung-familiaerer-krebs.html. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The number of entrepreneurs in Indonesia is still falling behind that of other countries, accounting for only 3.47% or about 9 million people of the total population. In comparison, the number of entrepreneurs in Singapore has reached 8.5%, while Malaysia and Thailand have reached 4.5%. If the low number of entrepreneurs continues to be overlooked, it may have an impact on the lag of economic development and public welfare, threatening the sustainability of the economy. This research aims to (1) identify the number of entrepreneurial university students (2) investigate supporting and inhibiting factors of entrepreneurial intention, and (3) find the implications of entrepreneurial intention on the emergence of new entrepreneurs. This study employs a qualitative design utilizing literature review of journals, previous research findings, and data. Data collection was carried out through questionnaires distribution and interviews with respondents who are students of Universitas Sebelas Maret. Subsequently, data analysis was conducted using descriptive narrative technique and interactive analytical model by Miles and Huberman. The findings indicate that (1) the number of university students who run a business is still small (2) factors that can influence entrepreneurial intention including internal factor, entrepreneurial attitude, and contextual factor (3) entrepreneurial intention has an impact on the emergence of new entrepreneurs. Given the small number of entrepreneurs, efforts should be made to improve this situation. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - Environmental sustainability is increasingly influencing organizational strategies, highlighting the critical role of absorptive capacity in knowledge transfer, learning, innovation, and performance within a green context. Despite a growing body of literature on this topic, a comprehensive review remains lacking. This study addresses this need by conducting a bibliometric and visualization analysis of 489 articles from the Web of Science database, providing an overarching understanding of the field’s size, dynamics, structure, and emerging trends. Using performance analysis and science mapping with VOSviewer and CiteSpace software, the research identified the most influential countries, journals, and authors; mapped the intellectual structure through co-citation analysis; and highlighted current research streams through bibliographic coupling, including green innovation, corporate social responsibility efforts, sustainable supply chain management, and inter-organizational learning. Co-word analysis uncovered research hotspots and future directions, emphasizing the centrality of absorptive capacity in linking knowledge acquisition to environmental strategies and organizational performance. Based on these findings, a systematic framework for applying absorptive capacity in the green context was developed, providing practical guidance for managers to enhance sustainability performance and competitive advantage. This study contributes to both absorptive capacity and environmental management literature by offering a holistic overview, synthesizing diverse perspectives, and bridging the gap between academic research and practical implementation. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Traditionally, extensive vehicle testing is applied to assure the robustness and safety of automotive systems. This approach is highly challenged by increasing system complexity. Formal verification lends a powerful framework for model-based safety assurance, but due to the mixed discrete–continuous behavior of automotive systems, traditional tools for discrete program verification are helpful but not sufficient. In academia, during the last two decades new approaches arose for the formal verification of such mixed discrete-continuous systems. However, the industry is not fully aware of this development, the tools are seldom tried and their applicability is not well examined. In a Ford–RWTH research alliance project, we aimed at evaluating the potential of knowledge and technology transfer in this area. This paper has two main objectives. Firstly, we want to report on the state-of-the-art in the above-mentioned academic development in a generally understandable form, targeted to interested potential users. Secondly, we want to share our observations after testing different available tools for their applicability and usability in the automotive sector and as a conclusion devise some recommendations. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Predicting future frames using historical spatiotemporal data sequences is challenging and critical, and it is receiving a lot of attention these days from academic and industrial scholars. Most spatiotemporal predictive algorithms ignore the valuable backward reasoning ability and the disparate learning complexities among different layers and hence, cannot build good long-term dependencies and spatial correlations, resulting in suboptimal solutions. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal predictive model with bidirectional distillation and level-specific meta-adaptation (SeeMore) in this paper, which includes a bidirectional distillation network (BDN) and a level-specific meta-adapter (LMA), to gain bidirectional multilevel reasoning. In the first stage, BDN concentrates on bidirectional dynamics modeling and coarsely constructs spatial correlations of different layers, while LMA is introduced in the second fine-tuning stage to refine the multilevel spatial correlations from a meta-learning perspective. In particular, BDN mimics the forward and backward reasoning abilities of humans in a distillation manner, which aids in the development of long-term dependencies. The LMA views learning of different layers as disparate but related tasks and guides the transfer of learning experiences among these tasks through learning complexities. Thus, each layer could be closer to its solutions and could extract more informative spatial correlations. By capturing the enhanced short-term spatial correlations and long-term temporal dependencies, the proposed model could extract adequate knowledge from sequential historical observations and accurately predict future frames whose backtracking preconditions are consistent with the historical sequence. Our work is general and robust enough to be integrated into most spatiotemporal predictive models without requiring additional computation or memory cost during inference. Extensive experiments on four widely used predictive learning benchmarks validated the proposed model’s effectiveness in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., 10.6% improvement of Mean Squared Error on the Moving MNIST dataset). © Science China Press 2024.

AB  - This paper examines the pervasive barriers hindering the widespread adoption of energy efficiency measures across various sectors. It categorizes these barriers into economic barriers, high upfront costs, organizational challenges, such as technical expertise and behavioral barriers, namely risk aversion and framing. To address these barriers, a comprehensive review of energy efficiency policies is conducted. These policies include incentives, coercive instruments, award systems, university industry collaboration, and technical support. To review energy efficiency barriers and policies, a methodological approach integrating non-structured snowball sampling with targeted literature review techniques was devised. Finally, the paper underlines that the success of these policies is contingent upon the active involvement, the collaboration, and the feedback of businesses, ensuring the feasibility of these policies. Their proactive engagement is indispensable in tackling energy efficiency barriers and driving the implementation of energy-efficient technologies, thus paving the way for a more sustainable and competitive businesses. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Communication and coordinated work among agricultural researchers, extension agents, and farmers is essential to promote innovation. In this article, we develop and present a typology of research-extension-farmers linkage models used by authors in their scholarly production from conducting a comprehensive literature review in English, Portuguese, and Spanish of 136 documents. We identified four linkage models: classical transfer of technology (ToT), moderate ToT with feedback, constructivist, and pragmatic. These models are based on different scientific paradigms, communication theories, and academic thinking about innovation. They propose different power relationships among actors and recognise their agency and otherness in different degrees. The findings show continuities between the ToT models and important differences between the models that value the active participation of farmers. The results contribute to the theoretical discussion and help in the design of institutional strategies and public policies, professional training, and critical thinking. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recognising that entrepreneurs’ actions are shaped by institutional environments, in recent years have witnessed a growing stream of research on ‘institutional entrepreneurship’. Institutional entrepreneurs are actors with sufficient resources, who create new institutions or transform existing institutions. Despite this centrality of resources, prior literature has not thoroughly explored the strategic implications of such resources. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of the institutional entrepreneurship literature using a resource-based lens and identified a sample of 155 papers published from 1980 to 2019. Our coding analysis identified tangible and intangible resources and resource mobilisation strategies in the institutional entrepreneurship literature. We propose a resource-based process model with three phases: emergence, elaboration, and expansion and apply this model to offer insights into resource mobilisation strategies during business and social entrepreneurship processes.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate university–industry partnerships in Armenia from the viewpoint of universities. By doing so, it contributes to the existing literature on university–industry collaboration by identifying and addressing the specific challenges that impede the establishment of successful university–industry partnerships in Armenia and other post-Soviet countries. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the barriers, benefits and institutional, functional framework of collaboration. Additionally, this study used a survey methodology to gather data from faculty managing staff members at six Armenian higher educational institutions on various aspects of university–industry collaboration as well as the perceptions and experiences of the participants. Findings: The results show that the effectiveness and applicability of the university–industry collaboration channels and institutional structures in six higher educational institutions are limited. Specifically, the channels that rely on academic entrepreneurship and innovation were found to be currently unviable. Moreover, the existence of spin-offs and start-ups is notably absent. Furthermore, limited access to funding and inadequate entrepreneurial support systems pose significant barriers to developing university–industry partnerships in Armenian reality. Originality/value: This study represents a pioneering effort within the context of Armenian higher educational institutions, as it is the first time a survey has been organized to specifically investigate the topic of university–industry partnerships. Before this study, there was a lack of empirical research and data collection on this topic in Armenian higher education settings. Therefore, this research holds significant originality and contributes to filling the existing gap in knowledge regarding university–industry partnerships in Armenia. The research is shedding light on a previously unexplored area and providing a valuable contribution to the field of university–industry collaboration research in Armenia and other post-Soviet countries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The literature on the research–practice gap in agriculture has evolved significantly in recent decades. Although there is a well-established body of work on how farmers adopt agricultural research outcomes and the factors that influence their adoption, research on how researchers perceive the process of transferring their results to practical applications, along with the factors that facilitate or hinder this process, remains inadequate. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review of empirical studies on knowledge transfer and its determinants from the perspective of agricultural researchers, covering publications from 1960 to 2024. It offers two key contributions: first, an original taxonomy of the channels through which agricultural research is transferred to farmers, and second, an integrative conceptual framework that links knowledge transfer to three categories of influential factors, related to researchers’ individual characteristics, the organizational context within research institutions, and the external environment. Based on the findings, a research agenda has been developed to serve as a foundation for future investigations into persistent gaps in the field. The findings hold value for both academic and practitioner communities as they provide deeper insights to improve the understanding and practice of knowledge transfer in agriculture. © 2025

AB  - In recent years, Embodied-Cognitive Linguistics (ECL), as an emerging field, has achieved significant theoretical advancement beyond Cognitive Linguistics, garnering increasing scholarly attention and practical applications. However, no systematic review has yet been conducted to synthesize its research developments. In order to investigate the current landscape, research frontiers, and future trajectories of ECL studies in China, this study employs bibliometric data from the China National Knowledge Network (CNKI) citation database. Through CiteSpace-based knowledge mapping analysis, we construct a research paradigm model and conduct visual analytics of domestic ECL scholarship. The findings reveal the following: (1) Embodied-Cognitive Linguistics research in China currently demonstrates vigorous development momentum, with sustained growth in annual publication output. While multiple collaborative author teams have emerged, inter-team cooperation remains limited. Professor Wang Yin from Sichuan International Studies University stands as the most prolific scholar in this domain. (2) The disciplinary influence of domestic ECL research remains constrained, with most publications confined to foreign language and literature studies involving limited linguistic varieties. Establishing a multidimensional, multidisciplinary, and multilingual research paradigm is imperative to gain recognition from both international Cognitive Linguistics communities and domestic Chinese linguistics circles. (3) Current research hotspots concentrate on three dimensions: philosophical origin-tracing, theoretical framework construction, and practical applications. (4) Future developmental trajectories will emphasize utilizing Embodied-Cognitive principles to profoundly reinterpret the contemporary value of Chinese classics while establishing translation theories with Chinese characteristics, thereby constituting an emerging research paradigm within domestic ECL studies. This review provides starting material for the design of bio-inspired artificial systems, based on hardware elements for the analysis of verbal information and implementation of effective man–machine interfaces. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - A nudge is a concept from Behavioral Economics and Psychology that refers to any small change or intervention designed to influence people’s behavior predictably, without restricting their options or significantly altering their incentives. The research follows the Design Science Research methodology, introducing Nudge Evidence Briefing (NEB) to facilitate the understanding, access, application of academic findings on nudges for non-academic professionals, considering the gap between academic research on nudges and their practical application. Leveraging insights from the Evidence-Based Medicine framework, NEBs distill key findings from primary research into concise, accessible documents. Through a systematic review of the literature on nudge integration into software privacy and security, 12 primary studies were selected and the data extracted from them was formatted into NEBs. Participants, specialists and non-specialists, were invited to evaluate the NEB through online questionnaires. Feedback highlighted the clarity and structured format of the NEB, with particular praise for its ability to communicate complex scientific evidence in an accessible way. Overall, the NEB demonstrates significant promise in making nudge-related research more accessible and feasible. Ongoing refinements based on participant feedback will be crucial to realizing its full potential, contributing to the advancement of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the practical application of nudges in professional environments. Future work will focus on evaluating the practical applicability of the NEB with non-academic professionals, exploring more reliable alternatives for generating NEBs through LLM, and developing a comprehensive repository of NEBs. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Over the past 20 years, universities have become the major drivers to improve scientific research and socio-industrial development, while Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have become key players in regional GDP contribution and technological innovation. Despite extensive studies on university-industry collaboration (UIC), there is a gap in the research on the micro-framework of University-SMEs collaboration (USC). This study addresses this gap by focusing on the interaction between universities and SMEs, intending to provide a detailed understanding of the influencing factors between universities and SMEs. This study conducted a systematic literature review of articles on USC from 2010 to 2023 and explored the internal and external factors that influence the success of USC. In terms of influencing factor analysis, this study ultimately focused on four conceptual groups: University-SMEs relationship (USR), University innovation and cooperation management (UICM), Actors, resources and capabilities (ARC), and Innovative concepts and spirit (ICS). Simultaneously, sub-items were expanded based on the conceptual groups to derive an overall conceptual framework that outlines the influencing factors of USC. The findings are expected to significantly impact academic literature and management practices, offering insights to enhance university-driven technology transfer to SMEs. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In facilitating higher academic exchanges, researchers frequently encounter the task of promptly and accurately pinpointing peers within their discipline to foster effective communication and collaboration. Traditionally, this endeavor has entailed scouring literature and attending conferences to stay abreast of fellow scholars' work. Nonetheless, this conventional method is notably time-consuming and inefficient, demanding researchers invest countless hours in perusing publications or navigating conference agendas. Recognizing this challenge, a compelling need arose for a more efficient approach to knowledge acquisition and synthesis. Herein, a pipeline system powered by Natural Language Processing technologies, including ChatGPT, BERT, and Knowledge Graphs was introduced. This system has been crafted to intelligently analyze academic literature, facilitating the rapid and precise identification of relevant researchers. This groundbreaking advancement significantly streamlines the literature review process, alleviating researchers' workload and bolstering decision-making in the organization of academic conferences and associated endeavors. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Generative AI tools are the cutting edge solutions of complex AI related problems. While investigating stateof- the-art results related to the effect of GenAI in the literature, one can note that the trends most likely lead to the expectation of a positive effect on the middle and long run. Based on these findings we define 4 productivity gain related hypotheses that we study using two types of methodologies. Namely we perform a survey research related to university-industry collaboration and quantitative studies mainly based on industrial productivity metrics. We have partnered with a major IT services provider - EPAM Systems - to be able to track, validate and analyze the key productivity metrics of software development projects, with and without using GenAI tools. This evaluation is being performed on various stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and on several project roles. Our goal is to measure the productivity increase provided by GenAI tools. Although this research has just started recently, considering that the area has extremely high attention we present some initial findings.

AB  - Fault diagnosis plays a crucial role in the condition monitoring and health management of rotating machinery. In recent years, there has been a remarkable upsurge of interest in partial domain adaptive fault diagnosis models. The majority of advanced methodologies strive to alleviate the issue of negative transfer by reducing the influence of outlier classes. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that outlier classes within the source domain still encompass valuable sensor information, which can significantly enhance the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To maximize the utility of outlier class samples instead of discarding them outright, we propose a method named principal properties attention matching (PPAM). First, we employ the principal properties extractor (PPE) to capture common features of fault instances from both shared and outlier classes, thereby characterizing the inherent relationships among the samples. Subsequently, we leverage the principal properties attention responder (PAR) to compute the properties-responsive weights, introducing an embedding-level weighting mechanism to achieve a more fine-grained matching and facilitate better domain adaptation in fault diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments performed under the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn, and PHM09 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method for industrial fault diagnosis. Specifically, on the more challenging Paderborn dataset, PPAM demonstrates a 2.77% increase in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Public-funded Research Organizations (PROs) are a class of research organizations carrying out R&D for the growth of industrial economy. These are distinct from University Research Organizations (UROs), despite both being publicly funded. While UROs are populated with student-faculty teams focused on academic research, PROs are populated with full-time professional researchers focusing largely on post-academic research. Technology transfers from PROs are important for national economic development and hence are worth a study. The objective of this paper is to study literature to (a) explore tech-transfer characteristics such as mechanisms, actors, success factors, stages, and models, and b) to gather any relevant insights. The method of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was adopted for this study. Compared to conventional narrative review, SLR offers a replicable, scientific, and transparent process that aims to minimize bias and provides an audit trail of the reviewer’s decisions. Hence, SLR by itself is considered a research. Among the various methods for the literature-analysis such as bibliographic analysis, meta-analysis and thematic analysis, this paper adopts thematic analysis consistent with the objectives of research and the limited size of the literature on the topic. Focusing chiefly on recent literature on domestic technology transfers from PROs, this work provides useful insights. © 2024 National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research.

AB  - Digital innovation can significantly enhance public health services, environmental sustainability, and social welfare. To this end, the European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) initiative was funded by the European Commission and national governments aiming to facilitate the digital transformation on various domains (including health) via the setup of relevant ecosystems consisting of academic institutions, research centres, start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises, larger companies, public organizations, technology transfer offices, innovation clusters, and financial institutions. The ongoing goal of the EDIHs initiative is to bridge the gap between high-tech research taking place in universities and research centres and its deployment in real-world conditions by fostering innovation ecosystems. In this context, the smartHEALTH EDIH started its operation in Greece in 2023, offering technical consultation services to companies and public sector organizations to accelerate digitalization in precision medicine and innovative e-health services by utilizing key technologies such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, cybersecurity, and others. During its first 20 months of operation, over 50 prospective recipients have applied for consulting services, mainly seeking “test-before-invest” services. This paper aims to provide insights regarding the smartHEALTH initiative, preliminary outcomes and lessons learned during this first period of operation. To this end, this paper outlines smartHEALTH’s approach to attracting recipients and providing expert guidance on utilizing state-of-the-art technologies for innovative services, product development, and process creation to accelerate digital transformation.

AB  - Over the last five decades, the Management of Technology (MoT) discipline has advanced through various phases, with a differing scholarly and academic focus. It is quintessential to comprehensively trace the research trends in the MoT discipline to understand its developmental journey. In this article, we study the research output distributed into three periods. Employing science mapping on a portfolio of 1866 articles and a full-text review of selected 91 articles, focal shift, and the developmental trends of the MoT discipline were revealed. We found the ascent of policy, aspects dealing with alliance formation, and the emergence of strategic MoT and intellectual property as the focal developmental shifts. The topics addressed in the 2011-2022 period represent contemporary hot research topics, such as decision-making tools required, their development and applications, capability development and acquisition, managing technological change, and the strategic aspects of the MoT discipline. The topics, particularly those in the emerging phase such as open innovation challenges, development of an ecosystem, and strategic aspects in the MoT discipline, will lead the development of the MoT discipline in the near future.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Collaboration between university and industry is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of innovation through knowledge transfer. Existing literature has explored the barriers and drivers of partnership establishment, but empirical studies are fragmented and need to be systematically integrated. From a stakeholder perspective, this systematic review aimed to propose a multi-perspective framework for University–Industry Collaborative Innovation (UICI) on value creation and develops the multi-perspective framework based on UICI drivers and barriers. Twelve drivers and seventeen barriers are categorized and analyzed according to the type of value they affect. The driver factors should be recognized so that collaborative parties can prepare for changes by investigating these influential positive factors. Finally, we make some concluding remarks and discuss some emerging topics in this field that are fertile for further investigation. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - A gap exists in the literature on how to implement theories of knowledge exchange (KE) into practice within an environmental management context. To support the improved practice of KE, we conducted a scoping literature review evaluating 56 empirical case studies globally to identify enabling conditions for implementing effective KE. Identified enabling conditions were organized into a core capacities framework, which highlighted essential elements of effective KE from organizational, individual, financial, material, practical, political, and social capacity dimensions. Results show that major enablers to effective KE relate to practitioners' individual and organizational capacity including the ability of practitioners (often boundary spanners) to establish trust with relevant actors through their interpersonal relationships and possessing sufficient background knowledge and skills to facilitate collaborations across disciplines and sectors. We also identified main challenges to engaging in KE (e.g., insufficient long- term funding for projects, lack of interpersonal skills for KE practitioners to build relationships and network, and inadequate background knowledge for practitioners to exchange knowledge in an accessible manner), and the outcomes and impacts that can emerge from effective KE work. We find that practitioners often perform quantitative evaluations that provide instantaneous and measurable impacts for the effectiveness of KE, but do not capture the impact of interpersonal relationships and trust that are best achieved through qualitative approaches. Lastly, the synthesis of enablers, challenges, outcomes, and impacts presented in this paper can be a resource for practitioners to identify what enablers may be missing from their KE strategies and in what capacity the KE work can be strengthened. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - While healthy buildings are investigated in academic research, practice, and policy, they often fail to address the needs and gaps due to insufficient knowledge transfer between them. Moreover, there is no general definition of healthy buildings that could act as a reference for different stakeholders of the building sector. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework for healthy buildings and a definition for compiling existing knowledge and addressing the needs and gaps. The holistic approach of the framework was developed through an extensive literature review and tested with 12 building case studies in the major European climate zones. The framework outlines five different dimensions (improving mental and physical health, designed for human needs, sustainably built and managed, resilient and adaptive, empowering people), including 24 indicators and sub-indicators. The validation of the framework revealed that it is possible to assess different building projects against different indicators under each dimension. However, challenges remain due to issues such as lack of time, cost of data collection, or lack of documentation. The developed framework provides a balanced approach that promotes both individual well-being and broader sustainability goals. It provides necessary guidance to inform practitioners and policy makers as well as other building sector stakeholders to integrate healthy buildings thinking into their project development, assessment, and decision making. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This bibliometric analysis of 239 articles from 2016 to 2025 maps the trends, gaps, and challenges of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in English-as-a-foreign-language education. Since 2024, research has surged due to technological progress and student-centered learning trends. Asian countries, notably China, lead in output, driven by high English proficiency demands and proactive technology integration. Leading journals such as Education and Information Technologies, System, and Computer Assisted Language Learning dominate the scholarly landscape. Research themes highlight GenAI tools’ effectiveness in language acquisition, while challenges such as academic integrity and the digital divide persist. Scholars advocate for teacher training in technology use and ethics. Future research should explore GenAI’s role in cross-cultural interactions, marginalized engagement, and long-term impacts and acceptance among teachers and students. Promoting collaboration, ethical use, and pedagogical innovation would enhance GenAI’s potential to meet the evolving needs of English-as-a-foreign-language learners. © 2025 IGI Global.
