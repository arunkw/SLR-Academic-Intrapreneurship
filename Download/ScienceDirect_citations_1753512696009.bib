abstract = {Background
While much has been written about the positive individual and collective effects of Supervised injection services (SIS), notably on health and drug-related harm, little research focuses on their operational context and constraints. Building on Lascoumes and Le Gales's “public policy instrument and instrumentation” framework (2007), this article analyzes the implementation of Montreal SIS and discusses how the organizational aspects of SIS produce the contexts for drug injection.
Methods
Using an ethnographic approach, this article draws on three types of data: 10 months of participant observation in a SIS (700 h); 19 semi-structured interviews with staff members (social workers, peers, heads of staff, management); and analysis of organizational documents (protocols, staff notebooks).
Results
First, this article examines how political context and advocacy coalitions produced Montreal SIS as a public policy instrument, affecting both the philosophy and the implementation of the service. It shows that Montreal SIS were developed under a health care network blueprint rather than a community organization harm reduction framework. Then, it analyzes how SIS as a policy instrument defines what constitutes appropriate injection practices, trying to supervise injection as an individual and technical act, rather than a broader social practice composed of pleasure, rituals, routines, and group dynamics.
Conclusion
Montreal SIS were conceptualized under a “health banner” and through alliances between regional public health administration and local well-known community organizations. They were then developed mostly under a health care administration blueprint, although operated at a ground-level by local community organizations. It created tensions between the logics of “zero risk” and “harm reduction”, and ambiguity about how injection should be supervised and what parts of drug use could be managed.}

abstract = {There is much talk about the need for stakeholder participation and inter-sectoral coordination in forest policy and management. But there is limited understanding about forest agencies' role in the adoption of new governance modes and their contribution to policy delivery. By drawing on a qualitative implementation study of Bavaria's Mountain Forest Initiative in locally-operating forest agencies, the present paper addresses these gaps. The government wants them to establish collaborative arrangements with various stakeholders to facilitate measures for adaptation to climate change in private forests. The cross-case comparison provides detailed empirical insights into distinct sets of activities for making the initiative ‘work’. Stakeholder participation gains a firm basis at the local level if forest agencies develop interest in and generate ownership of prospects for collaborative planning, and tailor these to their needs. The study suggests, however, that involvement of local stakeholders in forest planning is not necessarily instrumental for delivery of effective policies, as reliance on the local level entails the risk that the broader picture of initial policy goals gets lost.}

Prior studies have shown that the unique context of these regions can present significant challenges, which often lead to project failure. These studies generally examined the phenomenon at the organizational and societal levels, offering limited insights at the individual level, especially on how challenges are dealt with by entrepreneurs. By analyzing two ICT innovation projects in Bangladesh, we explore how entrepreneurs appropriate these challenges and suggest innovative solutions to achieve desired project outcomes. Drawing on the concept of “liminality,” we develop a process model that depicts how entrepreneurs adapt to contextual challenges and establish contextualized practices for successful ICT innovations. We discuss the strategies used by entrepreneurs for path creation during this process and highlight the importance of digital technologies in supporting these strategies. We then outline the implications of our findings for research on ICT innovation in underdeveloped regions.}

Specifically, we draw on Social Identity Theory to develop a conceptual framework that links identity and identity conflict to change related behavior. In this framework, we explain how multiple identities constrain but also stimulate agentic behavior in organizations. In particular, we highlight the underlying mechanisms through which conflicts in multiple identities lead to institutional change through processes of identity work and job crafting. Moreover, we specify how job discretion and business involvement affect the embedded agency of management accountants operating in different professional roles. We further predict that changes in MA practices are likely to have an effect on management accountants’ identities and may create new identity conflicts if they diverge from existing institutionalized identities. We highlight the implications of this model for our understanding of embedded agency and for future research directions in the field.}

Despite a growing interest in designing, facilitating, and evaluating such exploratory initiatives with respect to their systemic, less work has focused on how such initiatives support learning and capacity-building among its partaking actors and institutions including building experimental governance capacity. In this paper, we aim to better understand how exploratory and experimental initiatives with transformative sustainability ambitions relate to and influence their partaking actors and institutions. We draw from the North Mid Sweden Challenge Lab, an initiative to adapt, test and learn a governance approach to navigate complex sustainability challenges and transformations. It was part of a high impact action within a pilot for regional industrial transition framed around experiments in governance and policy by the European Commission and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where peer-learnings by and between regions was stated as an explicit goal. We focus on the kind of learning and knowledge creation processes that occur in these open-ended and multi-levelled social interaction processes. In this paper, we empirically engage with such learning processes with a focus on governance capacity, based on direct experiences from its participating actors and related institutions. This study builds on and extends conceptual understandings of scaling, embedding and other types of strategies and diffusion mechanisms in sustainability transformations and transitions with a focus on learning. We conclude that conducting exploratory initiatives seems to have functioned in legitimizing open-ended, cross-sectoral purposeful activities of deliberation, learning and search. However, sending out and leading explorations is not the same as preparing for and working with procedures to scale, transfer, embed and institutionalise learnings and results to alter mainstream ways of governing for complex challenges and systemic change – all key elements in developing experimental governance capacity in response to sustainability challenges.}

We find that all four proxies of climate uncertainty are positively associated with the adoption of voluntary carbon assurance and the positive associations are moderated by a country-level environmental, social, and governance reporting mandate and the industry. Finally, we document that voluntary carbon assurance impacts the valuation of certain dimensions of climate uncertainty. Overall, our study is among the first to document empirical evidence of the nature, characteristics, and dimensions of climate uncertainty and its impact on firms’ carbon assurance.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia, both among those countries with the world's highest deforestation rates, support supply chain laws on paper, but there are serious implementation deficits in practice. Using a tripartite framework developed by Cashore and Stone, our study addresses this alleged contradiction and explains deficits inherent in the laws based on the analysis of policy documents, expert interviews and field research. We find that companies take advantage of opportunities to shift exports to less regulating countries. EU member states exercise their purchasing power too cautiously over intermediary (manufacturing) countries in the supply chain, especially China. Finally, despite possibilities of public action, sanctioning is largely left to the private sector.}

The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the role of Islamic financing in supporting development of halal industry in Indonesia.
Design/methodology/approach
This research is divided into two studies. The first study uses survey-based quantitative method and the second study uses focus group discussion (FGD) method. Using a purposive and proportional sampling technique in the first study, this research collected 1,985 samples of Islamic financial products of business owners (demand-side) from all parts of Indonesia. The data were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling approach. The authors also conducted FGDs, involving 35 participants from government, financial, social and education institutions (supply-side) as well as business owners (demand-side) in three separated times.
Findings
In the first study, it can be identified that literacy on Islamic finance, attitude and awareness strongly affect business owners’ intention to use Islamic financial products. It is also found that subjective norm significantly influences literacy, attitude and awareness. Interestingly, religiosity does not significantly affect attitude toward Islamic financial products. According to the FGD in the second study, this research generates several factors motivating business owners’ preference to choose conventional rather than Islamic financial products, including expensive pricing, less developed technology, bad service quality and the halal status of the products. The reason for insignificant results of religiosity on attitude in the first study is explained in the second study. Most users are utilitarians who mainly perceived the products based on the sought benefits provided by the products.
Practical implications
This research offers the government a road map showing the strategy to build Islamic financial ecosystem in Indonesia. The road map integrates supply-side, which includes government, financial industries, social and education institutions and scientific organizations, and demand-side, which includes business owners or entrepreneur associations.
Originality/value
This research provides a wide range of samples derived from business owners’ respondents of halal industry in all representative islands in Indonesia. Therefore, it gives more holistic and representative findings. In addition, the analysis in this research covers not only the demand-side but also the supply-side perspective. Lastly, this research provides an Islamic financial ecosystem model that integrates all stakeholders to improve halal industry performance as a whole.}

The purpose of this paper is to assess the applicability of three institutional approaches — (1) the earlier variant of the neoinstitutional theory (ENIT), (2) its recent variant (RNIT), and the comparative institutional analysis approach (CIA) — to explain (non)adaptation behavior in host country environments. Using Walmart's acquisition cases, we show that the MNE adopted a non-adaptation behavior in Mexico and Germany—countries which represent vastly different institutional environments—and succeeded in the former, but failed and withdrew from the market in the latter. However, in the Japanese institutional environment, which is similar to the German one, Walmart engaged in selective adaptation and survived in the market. Based on the case data, we offer a critical assessment of the applicability of the three approaches. These three approaches provide a base on which to develop a model to explain the relationship between institutional influences, an MNE's organizational agency and adaptation behavior, as well as outcomes. Moreover, we discuss future research directions and provide implications for practitioners related to MNEs' adaptation behavior and the ensuing outcomes in host markets.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the use of flexible budgets may influence different institutional logics (organizational inertia and flexibility).
Design/methodology/approach
A qualitative research based on a single case study in a multinational subsidiary company was carried out. The data were mainly collected using the dialog technique through open-ended and semi-structured interviews and complemented with direct observation in informal and formal meetings and the analysis of internal documents. Content analysis was used for the analysis of the findings.
Findings
The use of flexible budgets, which isolates the negative variations due to the decrease in sales volume, may contribute to organizational inertia. However, this can be counterbalanced if the managers try to minimize the decline in performance through initiatives that promote organizational flexibility. In this case study, it was found that the alignment between the production director and the controller, who frequently work under different institutional logics, was important to stimulate organizational flexibility particularly in continuous improvement projects.
Research limitations/implications
The findings of this paper are based on only one in-depth case study. Hence, the results cannot be generalized, but a theoretical contribution can be made. Furthermore, the findings are constrained by the constructs used and the specific managerial and theoretical perspectives that have supported the analysis.
Practical implications
These results can be useful particularly for companies that are dealing with the abrupt drop in the sales volume and use the flexible budget as a performance assessment technique. These firms must pay attention because this combination can stimulate organizational inertia. To counteract this problem, it is necessary that controllers and the managers work by understanding the initiatives that promote organizational flexibility, mainly by Kaizen projects, which can minimize performance decline.
Social implications
The main contribution may be how to deal with the different managers’ behaviors, given the decrease in sales volume, and it can help an organization survives in times of economic recession and fierce competition environments.
Originality/value
This paper contributes to both practical and academic dimensions. Indeed, despite being widely used, flexible budgeting is not a widely researched topic.}

The purpose of this paper is to examine how national innovation policies strategically interact to form emergent de facto global entrepreneurship and innovation policies.
Design/methodology/approach
Reviews the innovation economics theory and policy literature, synthesizing the existing work into three models (autarky, cooperation and competition), then adds four new models of strategic interaction (asymmetric information, duopolistic competition, competitive factor mobility and complementary assets).
Findings
The different models predict very different outcomes. Therefore, it matters which model is true. Entrepreneurship and innovation policy needs to start with an improved science of strategic global interaction of national innovation policy.
Research limitations/implications
Conceptual approach only, without empirical analysis, calls for empirical analysis to test the different models.
Practical implications
Points to the problem of absence of global coordination in innovation policy arising from strategic interactions between national innovation policies. Recognizes that entrepreneurship public policy is caught in this strategic game, and that there are missing global institutions here.
Social implications
Improved innovation policy should enable more effective entrepreneurial environments.
Originality/value
Proposes seven models for understanding global strategic interaction of innovation policy, out of which four are new. These new ones are highly relevant to entrepreneurship policy.}

We collected and analyzed qualitative data on body-shaping undergarments (i.e., shapewear), which carry the contradictory logics of constricted femininity and flexible feminism. We explain how the extended materiality of shapewear creates intimate tension for consumers by interfering with how consumers relate to their own bodies and to other people, thereby prompting identity conflict.}

While participation in PES schemes is mandated in countries such as China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam, it remains unclear how PES schemes emerge in countries devoid of national mandates. This article investigates how actors have attempted institutional change to enable PES, by reinterpreting or adapting national laws, policies, and plans. We present an analytical framework theorising how geographical variations in (1) institutional frameworks, and (2) actor capabilities, dictate which institutions actors attempt to change. We then apply this framework to multi-scalar actors and institutions in Thailand and the Philippines. Our empirics reveal the types of institutional work that actors perform such as advocacy, education, mimicry, and networking, and demonstrate how this creates legal and discursive support, and improves stakeholder awareness and acceptance of PES as an environmental management strategy. Eight formal institutions are shown to have undergone change to enable PES across these countries, including those related to indigenous people, energy production, protected areas, pollution control, carbon offsetting, and decentralised governance. We show institutional change to be a geographical and contextual process that requires actors to match the right types of institutional work, with the right mechanism of institutional change, and a suitable target institution if they are to be successful in effecting change. Yet, we also report failed attempts, and explain how informal cultural norms act as challenges to formal institutional change. Through our comparative analysis of multiple institutions, actors, and national settings, we identify trends and make recommendations with global relevance to PES scholars and practitioners, and that can aid other initiatives that seek to address climate change and promote environmental sustainability.}

The purpose of this paper is to examine how hybrid organisations combine institutional logics to tackle complex social needs.
Design/methodology/approach
A multiple case study design was followed, and cases were selected using a two-staged sampling process. Using qualitative analysis, the mechanisms through which logics are selected, prioritised and get integrated in the strategies and practices of these organisations are illustrated.
Findings
The study contributes to the literature on hybrid organisations and their ability to address social problems in two important ways. First, the paper reveals through the concept of institutional rationality why market-based organisations emerge to address complex social needs in a complex institutional context. Second, the study demonstrates that there is heterogeneity in how logics are blended externally in their strategies and in how logics are integrated internally within the organisation.
Research limitations/implications
All the cases are selected from India; hence the possibility that the findings are valid only for countries with similar institutional and socio-economic contexts cannot be negated.
Practical implications
The policy implication is that if business organisations should embrace social goals substantively, a regulation in the form of CSR is not enough. Instead, there should be institutional provisions to promote such hybrid organisational forms where alternative logics such as community, profession, etc., are part of the core logics of the organisation.
Originality/value
This study connects the strategic choices of organisations with their institutional logics’ configuration in the Indian context.}

Design/methodology/approach
This study adopts the TPB model and tests the difference in intention between two different samples after they have been exposed to entrepreneurial education. Therefore, the data were analyzed using linear regression and students T-test. Data were collected from students studying at technical and nontechnical higher education institutions in Nigeria at the end of the semester to verify that they have been exposed to entrepreneurial education.
Findings
The findings reveal a weak significant relationship between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intention among nontechnical students, and no significant relationship was found among technical students after entrepreneurial education exposure. Further findings reveal no significant relationship between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intention when the samples are combined.
Practical implications
In response to the volatile economy and uncertain employment opportunities for graduates in Nigeria, the ministry of education and the management of higher education institutions (universities and polytechnics) have to integrate into the entrepreneurial education curriculum change of mindset, needed entrepreneurial skills, capabilities and entrepreneurial competence that is able to nurture the intention of students toward entrepreneurship opportunities identification and exploration in their immediate and extended markets.
Originality/value
This study provides a comprehensive empirical evidence of effectiveness of entrepreneurial education and intention between students with technical and nontechnical education background after entrepreneurial education exposure. This study is among the first that will put the survey timing into consideration. Therefore, fills important gap in the entrepreneurship literature.}

This study offers a comparison between female angels from a stereotype-threat–free environment and (a) male angels, and (b) female angel investors investing in a strongly male-dominated environment. Using proprietary survey data of 96 business angels, our findings confirm that the social context plays an important role in explaining female investment behavior and involvement in BA-group activities. We find that women in a female-only group do not feature investment behavior that differs significantly from men. Whereas women who invest as a minority in a male-dominated environment tend to behave differently. Investment experience, however, moderates the influence of male-dominated environments on female investment behavior. The study confirms earlier exploratory findings related to the role of stereotype threat in female business angel activity at the individual level. Contributing to stereotype threat theory and gender studies in the business angel literature, our findings suggest that the historically marginal contribution of women is a result of the social construction of their role in the finance industry, in which stereotype threats may be particularly prevalent, rather than of supposedly innate features of gender.}

In Hungary, as in other Central and Eastern European countries, the concept of social enterprise (SE) has attracted increased attention in recent years, with certain key actors shaping the organisational field. This growing interest is largely because of the availability of European Union funds focussing on the work integration of disadvantaged groups but ignoring other possible roles of SEs. This study aims to consider a seldom examined and underfunded area: SEs’ institutional environment and organisational activities in the social and health sectors.
Design/methodology/approach
Based on neoinstitutional theory, the paper uses desk research and qualitative case studies. It presents the experiences of SEs providing social and health services for specific disadvantaged groups.
Findings
This paper identified the key actors influencing the everyday operation of SEs and examined their connections, interactions and partnerships. Based on the findings, SEs primarily depend on the central state, public social and health institutions and local governments. At the same time, their connections with private customers, networks, development and support organisations, third sector organisations and for-profit enterprises are less significant. The key actors have a relevant impact on the legal form, main activities and the financial and human resources of SEs. SEs, however, have little influence on their institutional environment.
Originality/value
The paper contributes to understanding the opportunities and barriers of SEs in Hungary and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe, especially regarding their place in social and health services.}

abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims at understanding the action of pilot entities, in order to ultimately infer about their role to the overall reform process of public sector accounting (PSA).
Design/methodology/approach
Taking the Portuguese case as a reference, the new institutional theory (isomorphism perspective) and institutional logics are used to explain the action and stance of pilot entities in the implementation process of reforms.
Findings
Pilot experiments are expected to provide feedback on the main difficulties felt in the implementation of a new PSA system, helping to define a global strategy to overcome those problems and to improve the system to be generally and finally put into practice. Nevertheless, entities seem to find it important to be pilots, more for individual advantages than for the common benefit of the reform as a whole. Therefore, in order for them to actually be important actors in the reform process, pilots need to be included in the decision process, better realizing the benefits of the new IPSAS-based system and be provided with the proper technical, human and financial support.
Research limitations/implications
This research suffers from some limitations, namely concerning the use of questionnaires. The findings may, in some points, reflect the perceptions of the respondents and not the actual reality. Additionally, the respondents were not asked about any personal background factors, which may influence their answers. Also, they did not allow relating the new PSA system features with the way pilot entities (re)acted. In regard to the implications for practice, the study points to a need for decision-makers and external support bodies to work more closely with pilot entities in the overall design and implementation of PSA reforms. Pilot entities need to understand the importance and usefulness of changes, and reform authorities need to better recognize their institutional reality and the support they require. Only in this way, the use of pilots can make a difference in the implementation of PSA innovations.
Originality/value
This paper contributes to theory by adding to a better understanding of the role of the ones acting in the development and implementation of PSA innovations, enlightening on how pilot entities can act/react. Despite several studies on PSA reforms, very few so far have addressed pilot entities in particular, their attitude and actual contribution toward PSA reforms, and why. The case of Portugal as a frontrunner in adopting an IPSAS-based system within the EU helps contribute to that understanding in the setting of European countries.}

Drawing upon an unusually rich dataset spanning 9752 digitized archival documents, we categorize and code decisions taken by policymakers on several levels while also mapping and quantifying the strategic activities of both entrant firms and incumbent monopolists over a decade. Our data concerns two empirical cases from Sweden during the time period 1980–1990: the financial sector and the telecommunications sector. In both industries, a combination of technological and institutional upheaval came into motion during this time period which in turn fueled the revitalization of the Swedish economy in the subsequent decades. Our findings show that Swedish policymakers in both cases consistently acted in order to promote the emergence of more competition and de novo entrant firms at the expense of established monopolies. The paper quantifies and documents this process while also highlighting several enabling conditions. In conclusion, the results indicate that successful innovation policy in mature economies is largely a matter of strategically dealing with resourceful vested interest groups, alignment of expectations, and removing resistance to industrial renewal.}

Design/methodology/approach
To address the first research objective, focus group discussions were conducted with management teachers practicing consultancy. These results were used to generate items for the questionnaire. Factor analysis performed on the data revealed six determinants influencing management teachers to engage in consulting activity. To address the second research objective, focus group discussions with MBA graduates were used to comprehend how teachers with management consulting experience enrich the pedagogy.
Findings
The major findings of the study suggest that the determinants influencing management teachers to practice consulting are: improving competencies, furthering professional advancement, accruing strategic and financial benefit, enabling holistic development. Through study 2, the authors found out that management teachers add value in pedagogy by forging corporate world connection through real-time examples, enable critical thinking by breaking established paradigms, effective classroom delivery through storytelling, etc., and lending student support by assuming a mentor’s role.

Information technology (IT) constitutes an important driver for innovation in the public sector. However, taking advantage of IT to innovate requires the existence of other organizational and institutional capabilities within the public organization. Using absorptive capability theory, the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between principles for IT governance and dynamic capabilities across semi-urban (between 10,000 and 149,000 inhabitants), urban (between 150,000 and 600,000 inhabitants) and metropolitan (more than 600,000 inhabitants ) municipal governments in Mexico.
Design/methodology/approach
This study reports on three workshops involving 34 chief information officers (CIOs) from semi-urban, urban and metropolitan municipalities. The workshop agenda included a series of brainstorming exercises to discuss – among other topics – the capabilities required for digital government innovation. The capabilities collected during the workshops were codified by the authors based on their relationship to the six IT governance standardized principles and the four dynamic capabilities identified in the literature. The authors used descriptive and correlation analyses to show the importance of governance principles and dynamic capabilities for innovation, as well as the relationships between those two dimensions, in each type of municipality.
Findings
This study shows that specific IT governance principles may enhance innovation capabilities linked with knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Moreover, the ways in which IT governance principles support innovation are linked to size, resources and complexity of the local government. In conclusion, this study discusses the primary IT policy implications to improve possibilities to innovate in the public sector.
Originality/value
Although researchers and practitioners agree that following principles of good governance may enhance performance and innovation in the provision of public services, the link between the principles of IT governance and capabilities to spur innovation has not yet been fully established in the literature. Thus, in this study, empirical evidence of this linkage is provided.}

abstract = {We examine how digital innovation intermediaries, mandated to support the digital transition as part of digital policy agendas, engage in institutional work to facilitate the adoption and diffusion of digital technologies. Building on neoinstitutional theory and the socio-technical transitions literature, our investigation aims to uncover intermediaries' institutional work on cultural-cognitive, normative, and regulative institutions across three levels of intermediation: organisation-, network- and ecosystem level. Based on a large evidence base related to 18 publicly-funded digital innovation intermediaries in France, including primary and secondary sources, we uncover the various forms of institutional work intermediaries engage in while facilitating the digital transition. We find that intermediaries' institutional work focuses on disrupting symbolic systems, creating relational systems and artefacts, and creating and maintaining routines. Intermediaries carry out different kinds of institutional work at different levels of intermediation. Furthermore, different types of intermediaries focus on distinct levels of intermediation and different institutions. Implications for policy and management are discussed.}

abstract = {Small resource‐based communities across Canada are experiencing rapid change within a volatile, fluctuating global economy. As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls‐Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest‐sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change.
Resumen
Las pequeñas comunidades basadas en recursos naturales de todo Canadá están experimentando rápidos cambios en una economía mundial volátil y fluctuante. A medida que las comunidades intentan diversificar sus economías, se enfrentan a complejos entornos políticos neoliberales provinciales y federales que ofrecen menos recursos de financiación al tiempo que descargan más responsabilidades en los gobiernos locales. A partir de los estudios de caso de Burns Lake (Columbia Británica) y Grand Falls‐Windsor (Terranova y Labrador) en Canadá, se estudió cómo los pequeños municipios utilizan las empresas municipales para generar ingresos y activos que pueden conducir a nuevas vías económicas. Nuestras conclusiones sugieren que las estrategias empresariales municipales están teniendo un éxito desigual a la hora de romper con las dependencias pasadas del sector forestal. Estos pequeños municipios siguen enfrentándose a riesgos operativos y de desarrollo, así como a debates sobre si utilizar los ingresos para hacer frente a las nuevas responsabilidades municipales y al aumento de la demanda sobre infraestructuras envejecidas y servicios anticuados frente al cambio transformador.

To achieve this objective, we first of all built a performance evaluation system to understand the relative performance of these trade routes. A questionnaire survey was carried out to reveal the differing views on route performance, and Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was then used to examine and interpret the survey data. Secondly, by dividing the interviewees into two groups, we examined whether the government’s development priorities are at variance with the preferences of industry practitioners. Thirdly, we explored the reasons for the variance by conducting an intensive interview with ten key stakeholders and then explain the findings from the perspective of institutional theories. Finally, we addressed the uncertainty and dynamics of route development under three different scenarios. Several managerial implications are proposed on the basis of our findings.}

First, we provide a review of the dominant concepts of institutional theory, and a summary of how institutional theory has been used in the sport management literature. Then we offer two broad discussion points about the use of institutional theory in sport management research. The first point is a call for further elaboration of institutional theory in sport management by examining issues of institutional change and organizational field dynamics. The second is point as to suggest that scholars extend the use of institutional theory into different types of sport management questions.}

It is based on an in-depth study of new high-tech small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and more established IT companies in Iran. We explore the process by which social media affordances interplay with forces of institutional entrepreneurship to create conditions for social change. More specifically we study the adoption in Iran of new business practices and models more commonly seen in other contexts, and relate this to the features of the platforms and the characteristics of a new generation of Iranian entrepreneurs. Drawing on institutional logics theory we conceptualize this process as one of transposition of logics in which dominant religious logics are challenged by market logics enabled by the mutual constitutional effects of human and material agencies. We suggest that three main mechanisms underpin this process: the discovery of practices from different institutional contexts, the appropriation of foreign practices, and the objectification of these practices. The study further contributes to the debate on the paradox of embedded agency and adds to the literature by providing a more integrated view of the role of social media in social change.}

Our empirical exploration of the Swiss watchmaking field in its current turbulent causal texture enables us to examine the locus of strategic action (intra-field vs inter-field) by both incumbents and challengers, and how they enact the strategic stances of preparation, relocating and reinventing collaboration. With this lens we also analyse the roles a legacy technology can play in the framing-reframing contention, where incumbents favour an ‘intra-field’ framing (i.e. centred in the legacy technology) whereas challengers favour an ‘inter-field’ reframing (i.e. open to emerging technologies). Our research further contributes to the literature by providing a clarification of the Ramirez and Selsky (2016) strategic stances in relation to its core unit of analysis: field-level vs organizational-level vs inter-organizational network level and does so with empirical data.}

The findings show a positive correlation between ESG performance and cash ETRs. The findings are robust to an instrumental variable approach that controls for the potential endogeneity between ESG performance and cash ETRs. For non-financial firms, this positive correlation between ESG performance and cash ETRs is particularly driven by the environmental aspect of ESG performance, whereas it is driven by the social and governance aspects of ESG performance for financial firms. Additional analysis indicates that the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy dimension, which measures a firm’s integration of CSR aspects into its daily decision making, has a positive impact on cash ETRs. The findings seem to suggest that corporate culture can influence tax strategies.}

This analysis approaches the issue from the standpoint that a decrease in fossil energy production can proceed more smoothly when mutually supportive interactions between media and energy systems are implemented. This empirical case analysis illuminates one of the intersection nodes between energy and media policies – mediated listening to vulnerable groups hit by the sustainable transition. The author explains how the mode of operation of the news media hinders listening to miners who are losing their jobs. She also explains what may motivate mediated listening and suggests that sustainable energy policy interventions can be designed to create mutually useful interrelations between energy and media systems. The media can gain new audiences during energy system destabilisation, and energy policy implementers can gain insight into the needs of vulnerable groups hit by downsizing.}

We utilize a combined and enriched functional-structural technological innovation system (TIS) analysis to identify systemic problems in the water harvesting TIS in rainfed agricultural production systems of Jordan. Results indicate Jordanian water harvesting TIS development is hindered by three principal blocking mechanisms: 1) inadequate financial resources to support innovation; 2) lack of a common vision across government ministries; 3) institutional problems that inhibit legitimizing the technology. These challenges are caused by interlocking systemic problems, which indicate the need for integrated policy approaches and interventions. Our analysis reinforces the concept that in developing countries, donor interventions should be centrally considered because they play a role in influencing priorities throughout the system and in supporting TIS development. Donors can counteract TIS development and contribute to directionality problems that favor one form of the technology over another, which gives insufficient protection for the water harvesting TIS until markets for technologies form. This would require more effective coordination between different donors’ efforts to develop critical mass in TIS development. We also show that cultural institutions and interactions between formal and informal land tenure laws play a significant role in causing an erosion of trust in the government and counter efforts to promote and engage farming communities in water harvesting activities and innovation. This requires recognition that, in developing countries, informal institutions may have the same status as formal institutions.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop an original six-phase model describing entrepreneurial learning in the transition of place-based enterprises toward a sustainable exploitation of natural common resources (commons).
Design/methodology/approach
The six-phase model proposed by this study explains the learning processes involving place-based enterprises through two important existing theories: adaptive co-management and Lachmann’s evolutionary, embedded theory of entrepreneurship. The proposed model integrates these two theories on the basis of a longitudinal case study on the fishing enterprises in an Italian marine protected area (MPA).
Findings
In the case study, the success factors identified by the adaptive co-management literature proved important in enabling an embedded entrepreneurial learning process consistent with Lachmann’s view. The case analysis allowed the authors to cluster these learning processes around six phases. Further, even if traditional fishing is not knowledge-intensive, this case shows the transition to a sustainable business model required intense efforts of educated institutional work and scientific research. Interestingly, the key learning processes were enabled by the emergence of a larger, networked social entity (a network form of organization) including the community of fishermen, the MPA management and a network of scientists studying the marine area ecosystem.
Research limitations/implications
This study is explorative and relies on a single case study. Despite this limitation, it opens up new research paths in the fields of entrepreneurship, institutional work, network organizations and adaptive management of the commons.
Originality/value
This study is strongly interdisciplinary; it proposes an original model based on a theoretical view that is highly innovative for organization and management studies; and addresses a relevant but overlooked issue with important societal implications.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship between the formal (governance established in law) and informal institutions (governance not established in law) that underpin the planning, operation and improvement of local and regional public transport, by using case studies of four countries: Britain (more specifically England, outside London); the Netherlands; Germany; and Sweden. The paper uses a framework drawn from the literature on institutional change to analyse the interplay between the formal governance structures and the other actors and organisations that have an influence on public transport, the formal and informal relationships between them, and how informal institutions emerge to increase the effectiveness with which public transport is delivered. By selecting countries with some similarities in institutional structure, it is possible to explore how relationships can differ even within a relatively similar overall framework for public transport. Drawing on qualitative research with actors in the different countries, the research explores how informal institutions help actors negotiate the constraints of formal, statutory institutions. Findings reveal that informal institutions smooth the critical interfaces where formal institutions were producing sub-optimal public transport, thus providing evidence that the two modes of governance are, in fact, highly complementary.}

By examining the positive impact of buyers' DT on suppliers' carbon emission reduction (CER), we validate the existence of buyers' DT environmental spillovers. This study collects and analyzes supply chain data of Chinese A-share listed firms during 2008–2021. We construct an ordinary least squares (OLS) model and perform a cluster-robust estimation with supplier-buyer pairs as clusters. Mechanism analysis identifies two environmental spillover mechanisms—the pushback and technology spillover effects. Moreover, we find a spatial decay pattern in the buyers' DT environmental spillovers. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that such spillovers are more pronounced when suppliers are identified as polluters or when the digitization gap is narrower. This study complements the green supply chain management (GSCM) literature and provides relevant suggestions for governments and manufacturing firms in emerging economies.}

IQ-reflective tests are used in primary and secondary schools to sort students into groups, and by universities and employers to select between applicants. Drawing on several sociological literatures (i.e. the diffusion of institutions, social stratification, and self-fulfilling dynamics), we argue that the current applications of IQ-reflective tests allow individuals with high IQ scores to receive greater access to developmental resources, enabling them to acquire additional capabilities over time, and ultimately perform their jobs better. This institutional explanation for the IQ–job performance link is an alternative to the prevailing assertion that IQ facilitates job performance through on-the-job learning. Further, this explanation suggests that the frequently repeated prescription “select on intelligence” may be institutionally contingent.}

This paper analyses the potential of rapid, large-scale socio-political change as a window of opportunity for transformative change of natural resources governance. We hypothesize that shocks at higher levels of social organization may open up opportunities for transformation of social-ecological systems into new pathways of development. However, opportunities need to be carefully navigated otherwise transformations may stall or lead the social-ecological system in undesirable directions. We investigate (i) under which circumstances socio-political change has been used by actors as a window of opportunity for initiating transformation towards sustainable natural resource governance, (ii) how the different levels of the systems (landscape, regime and niche) interact to pave the way for initiating such transformations and (iii) which key features (cognitive, structural and agency-related) get mobilized for transformation. This is achieved through analyzing natural resource governance regimes of countries that have been subject to rapid, large-scale political change: water governance in South Africa and Uzbekistan and governance of coastal fisheries in Chile. In South Africa the political and economic change of the end of the apartheid regime resulted in a transformation of the water governance regime while in Uzbekistan after the breakdown of the Soviet Union change both at the economic and political scales and within the water governance regime remained superficial. In Chile the democratization process after the Pinochet era was used to transform the governance of coastal fisheries. The paper concludes with important insight on key capacities needed to navigate transformation towards biosphere stewardship. The study also contributes to a more nuanced view on the relationship between collapse and renewal.}

The paper develops a theoretical framework for institutional analysis, combining the overall institutional setting with the roles of individual actors confronting a collective action problem. Results suggest that the project represents an observable trend in freight funding policy in the United States, moving away from congressional earmarks which have been criticised in the past for their subjective nature, and towards a more transparent, bid-based system. Findings from the research demonstrate that the institutional setting has been transformed, moving towards a reconciliation between top-down planning approaches and market-driven private sector development. Furthermore, encouragement of multi-state public–private consortia will potentially make it easier to develop national corridors that can support new markets, while generating both public and private benefits.}

Both in adaptation plans and local development strategies, much attention is given to the inclusion and integration of communities with local governments and key agents.

The framework's development is based on qualitative empirical fieldwork and integrates insights into organizational theory; neo-institutional theory, the attention-based view of the firm, and organizational culture theories. I conclude that decisions on energy efficiency are results of problematization and theorization processes. These processes emerge between the institutional issue-field, the organization, and its members. The model explains decisions shaped by environment (external and material), organizational processes (energy-efficiency practices, climate and culture) and individuals’ characteristics. The framework serves several purposes: introducing a meta-theory of decision making, providing a concept for empirical analysis, and enabling connectivity to the research on barriers.}

We collected in-depth interviews, archival records and field observations within the R&D research setting of an industrial R&D project in the period of 2015 to 2017. Our findings identify three types of means-ends decoupling work in R&D project implementation: ‘work on’ causal complexity, ‘work at’ behavioural invisibility, and ‘work with’ practice multiplicity. In addition, we uncover six dynamic micro-mechanisms that collectively influence the making and nature of means-ends decoupling work and therefore serve to allow for the fluid switching of work as the institutional conditions permit. Overall, our findings have significant implications for understanding means-ends decoupling as a highly skilled network competence for managing R&D project implementation goals.}

Under the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), subjective norms are important antecedents of entrepreneurial intent. But little is known about the forces that shape these. Hofstede’s national culture has implicated, but the conceptual distance between it and subjective norms is wide. The purpose of this paper is to explore an intermediate level to propose a mechanism by which national cultures give rise to individual beliefs about entrepreneurship.
Design/methodology/approach
Uses Q methodology with data from seven countries to discover patterns of beliefs in diverse cultures. Hierarchical clustering characterises an intermediate-level mechanism.
Findings
In each country, a small number of patterns emerge, two of which are found in every country studied – despite the large cultural differences. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, a model of individual sensemaking is developed to bridge between monolithic national culture and idiosyncratic subjective norms of individuals, and to explain the commonality of belief patterns observed. Several propositions are suggested for testing the model.
Originality/value
Reports cultural attitudes towards entrepreneurship at a more granular level than previous research, and thereby discovers the existence of cross-cultural patterns. Proposes a novel model that connects macro forces of national culture with individual precursors of TPB through cultural entrepreneurship.}

However, there are many social barriers in subsistence contexts that exclude vulnerable groups from participating in, and benefiting from, the shared value creation process. These social barriers are contextual in nature and arise from sources such as gender-based discrimination or caste-based discrimination. The exclusion of such vulnerable groups undermines the goal of inclusive social innovation and sparks concerns of elite-capture of shared value in subsistence marketplaces. In this paper, we highlight how social enterprises can overcome the concern of elite-capture of shared value by fostering inclusive social innovation in subsistence contexts. Our research draws from a longitudinal inductive study of nine Indian social enterprises operating in industrial markets such as agriculture and logistics. We apply and extend insights from institutional work perspective to uncover three principal mechanisms for fostering inclusive social innovation, namely – a) relational work, b) inclusion work and c) equity work. These mechanisms work in concert to facilitate the a) creation of shared value in subsistence contexts, b) inclusive distribution of shared value, and c) fair distribution of shared value.}

abstract = {Purpose
This article seeks to theorize and empirically examine the conditional mechanisms through which entrepreneurial legitimacy determines the success or failure of new ventures by building upon Zimmerman and Zeitz's (2002) causal process model of legitimacy.
Design/methodology/approach
We gathered cross-sectional data from 266 Japanese new venture owners running their businesses across a variety of sectors and empirically examined whether, how and when legitimacy positively affects new ventures' performance by employing the SPSS PROCESS macro for moderated mediation analysis.
Findings
The results indicate that rich access to a pool of valuable resources fully mediates the positive effects of legitimacy on new venture growth. Furthermore, this study offers robust empirical evidence that prior entrepreneurial experience and competitive intensity as the internal and external contingency factors significantly moderate the indirect effect of legitimacy on new venture growth through resource accessibility.
Research limitations/implications
Although our analysis provides clear support for the view that important resources for new venture performance are gained through legitimacy, it does not offer precise clarifications for the type and sources of legitimacy and for the strategies that could be deployed to achieve legitimacy. Future studies should clearly distinguish tangible assets (e.g. financial resources) from intangible assets (e.g. tacit knowledge, networks and reputation) in terms of resource accessibility. Therefore, it should be worth scrutinizing the multiple dimensions of resources as potential mediators of the legitimacy-new venture growth relationship in greater depth.
Practical implications
From a policy perspective, this study suggests that a special emphasis needs to be placed on designing and carrying out policies aimed at increasing the visibility and credibility of entrepreneurship as a positive career path since public acceptance of entrepreneurship is essential to new venture growth. Furthermore, it is logical to conclude that achieving greater legitimacy is a pivotal strategic tool not only to overcome resource barriers but also to maximize a probability of survival, specifically for those entrepreneurs without prior experience and those operating in a fiercely competitive market environment.

Unlike previous studies that have mostly presented the direct effect of entrepreneurial legitimacy on venture outcomes (Capelleras et al., 2019; Kibler and Kautonen, 2016; Pindado and Sánchez, 2017), our research empirically identified the potential complexities inherent in this relationship by performing a conditional indirect effect analysis.}

keywords = {Innovation, Complexity, Economic, Social, Characteristics, Megaprojects},
abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview from the literature on how best to define megaprojects in contemporary contexts. There is a need for a definition that encompasses a complex matrix of characteristics, inclusive of positive and negative aspects, which are not necessarily industry or sector specific. Whilst megaprojects have often been described and defined in terms of cost, they are more accurately delineated by their convolutions. Intricacies arise from political intrigues surrounding funding of such projects and managing and governing complex social and organizational relations. Points for future research are also identified.
Design/methodology/approach
An analysis of international megaproject literature over the past five years combined with seminal works was undertaken, drawing on the broad literature of project and program management combined with elements of organizational theory. Whilst some examples are cited, in-depth case analysis has not been covered.
Findings
Albeit that the scale of some megaprojects is comparable to national GDPs, seven more characteristics beyond size have been identified, which distinguish megaprojects from large projects. These include: reach; duration; risks and uncertainties; widely disparate actors; areas of controversy such as dispute resolution; and legal and regulatory issues.
Research limitations/implications
The paper takes a broad overview and whilst some examples are cited, in-depth case analysis has not been covered. The overview does however provide a good synopsis of the future research areas that warrant exploration.
Practical implications
The paper identifies a range of analytical areas for major future research including further exploration of institutional analysis. Areas for further analysis include stakeholder issues; collaboration and understanding between technical and business personnel and reforming notions of procurement and contractual arrangements.
Social implications
Rigorous stakeholder engagement is critical for success in megaprojects, and collaborative learnings need to be exchanged. The longer term social and economic impacts need to be viewed as an imperative rather than a hindrance to the planning and execution of megaprojects and complexity rather than cost more aptly defines megaprojects.
Originality/value
The paper moves the definition of megaprojects to beyond measurement on the basis of cost to complexity and social and economic variables.}

This article seeks to understand the current state of impact evaluation practice in the development field by examining standard-setting documents intended to guide the behavior of entities involved in development assistance. We explore these standards as representations of institutional logics that encode current norms, practices, and expectations for these actors and examine the extent to which impact evaluation norms and practices are enshrined within these standard-setting documents. To do so, we examine guidance from a diverse set of 42 standards to better understand how evaluation is conceptualized and what standards are being articulated. We find both convergence and divergence in the institutional logics employed and in how evaluation norms and practices are incorporated into standards. We see convergence in the adoption of a normative, process-oriented logic that appears across many entities in the widely articulated commitment to practices such as information sharing, participation, and listening. We find more divergence in the adoption of a results-oriented logic that implies a commitment to impact evaluation. These distinct logics give rise to two discrete discourses: an “evaluation generalist” discourse that conceptualizes evaluation in broad terms and an “impact centric” discourse that articulates a more comprehensive set of principles emphasizing causal attribution. We suggest that structural characteristics and positionality in the aid system may help explain the adoption of different institutional logics and associated evaluation practices.}

abstract = {General consumer and business finance companies have had limited success in serving the needs of economically active low-income families and micro-enterprises cost-effectively and sustainably in emerging economies such as China. Recent advances in computing and telecommunications technology are dramatically transforming this landscape by changing the way the financial industry operates. A key mechanism underlying this transformation concerns the use of big data in assessing, evaluating and refining the creditworthiness of potential borrowers and reducing the transaction costs. While China’s internet-only banking industry is currently small and some activities of players in this industry are akin to those in the shadow banking, this industry has potential to cause a major disruption in the Chinese financial market. A main objective of this paper is to examine the role of big data in facilitating the access to financial products for economically active low-income families and micro-enterprises in China. A second objective is to investigate how formal and informal institutions facilitate and constrain the use of big data in the Chinese financial industry and market. The paper also investigates how various inherent characteristics of big data – volume, velocity, variety, variability and complexity – are related to the assessment of the creditworthiness of low-income families and micro-enterprises. Case studies of big data deployment in the Chinese financial industry and market are discussed. The paper also looks at various categories of personal financial and non-financial information that are being used as proxy measures for a potential borrower’s identity, ability to repay and willingness to repay. Various business models involving the sources of data (internal vs. external to the big data organization) and providers of credits (big data organization vs. external partners or clients of the big data organization) are investigated. The analysis of the paper indicates that the main reason why low-income families and micro-enterprises in China and other emerging economies lack access to financial services is not because they lack creditworthiness but merely because banks and financial institutions lack data, information and capabilities to access the creditworthiness of and effectively provide financial services to this financial disadvantaged group.}

abstract = {Purpose
This research aims to see whether replication occurs with the focus on the Japanese HR system, following the latest studies on expatriate management in Japan. Whereas the total number of self-initiated expatriates has hugely increased in Japan, the high turnover rate is a big issue. Can this also be evidenced with new data? How does the Japanese HR system, with its notorious reputation for unique people management methods, relate to the expats' reasons for staying in the long or short term?
Design/methodology/approach
Replication of research is adopted here with an interview-based qualitative method using the same research design as previous literature. The previous research focused on Chinese and Vietnamese self-initiated expatriates, who occupy the majority of expatriate positions in Japan. This study has a new target group of Thai expatriates, who have a relatively higher educational background than some other expatriates and are expected by the Japanese firms to stay over the long term.
Findings
Replication of the findings of the latest studies occurs in this research. The turnover rate is as high as other national expatiates, with similar reasons, related to the Japanese HR system. However, there are also different issues. The main reasons they give for not staying in the long-term are unhealthy work habits, followed by slower promotion and ambiguous work content/role. The Japanese HR system is a dehumanising mechanism leading to a stressful work environment, which is the most critical concern for them and the main reason they choose not to remain in the long term.
Originality/value
Past studies indicate an expectation gap between Japanese firms and expatriates, which is also found in this study. Additionally, an assumption gap between them about security under the HR system is also confirmed. Security means working healthily for expatriates while it means long-term employment for Japanese firms.}

keywords = {Signaling theory, Assurance levels, Independent accountant’s reports, Venture funding},
abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to examine whether the ability of early-stage ventures to obtain external funding and the amount of additional information provided to potential investors are affected by the level of assurance (audit, review or compilation) received from independent accountants on the ventures’ historical financial statements. The assurance level provided should differently impact potential investors’ willingness to invest in a new venture and need for additional information during due diligence evaluation of the organization and entrepreneur.
Design/methodology/approach
To examine the relative effects of the signal provided by these levels of assurance on investment decisions, a survey is administered to collect data regarding an investment-related decision scenario. The three levels of assurance in independent accountant’s reports (audit, review or compilation) is manipulated when eliciting participants’ responses.
Findings
Results indicate that respondents perceive the signal provided by compilation reports, review reports and audit reports as increasing in reliability and are more likely to invest in a venture providing reports with that increasing reliability. Audited financial statements are viewed as the most reliable and provide a positive signal to potential investors and lenders. Consequently, potential investors may require less additional information from entrepreneurs with audited financial statements when conducting due diligence investigations.
Research limitations/implications
Subjects used (Master of Business Administration students, with an average work experience of over six years, including some with investing experience) may not be the best proxies for early-stage investors.
Originality/value
This is the first study to examine the relative effectiveness of signals provided by the independent accountant’s audit, review and compilation reports in assisting early-stage business ventures and entrepreneurs raising funds, and dealing with due diligence requests for additional information. Results indicate that engaging an auditor for independent assurance on financial statements can benefit entrepreneurs by increasing the likelihood of obtaining necessary funds and decreasing the amount of additional information needed by potential investors.}

The findings from 267 manufacturing companies in Iran show that business ties have an effect on firm performance through product innovation, while the role of innovation is not proved as a mediating variable in the relationships between political ties and firm performance. In addition, business ties have an effect on product innovation and firm performance, whereas political ties have no such effect.

Drawing on theories of ascriptive inequality and the institutional logics perspective, we propose a multi-level theoretical model that illustrates how institutional logics at the macro-, meso-, and micro-level, allow inequality due to foreign national origin to be produced, increased, or mitigated. Our theoretical model also explicates the cross-level effects of institutional logics on inequality toward international migrant employees. Lastly, our theorization explores how inequality due to foreign national origin can be questioned and tackled. Implications for theory, practice, and policy are discussed.}

We used triangulate methods based on 40 semi-structured interviews, participant observation and document collections. We found that PR actors do not passively respond to institutional pressures, but rather creatively and reflexively interpret and incorporate existing cultural aspects, especially guanxi and harmony, to construct and transform their PR practices. These practices offer insights into why and how guanxi, as well as other cultural factors, are integrated and legitimised in PR practice in China.}

A key feature of innovation systems are system resources - collective structures such as common standards, support programs, shared expectations or testing facilities all actors can use. System resources emerge either uncoordinated or as a result of strategic action by ‘system builders’. In this paper we explore the conditions of system building. Taking a strategy perspective, we analyze how system building depends on resource constellations at a certain point in time. Drawing from research in the field of stationary fuel cells in Germany, we identify three generic modes, of system building: a) the “single mode”, in which a system builder uses its own organizational resources to create a system resource, b) the “partner mode”, in which a system builder joins forces with partners in order to co-create system resources, and c) the “intermediary mode”, in which a system builder collaborates with other actors to set up an intermediary organization, which then works towards the creation of system resources. We show that the modes were chosen depending on i) what resources were initially available and ii) how they were distributed in the innovation system. Our paper contributes to a more differentiated understanding of system building in the TIS literature and beyond.}

Second, our analysis offers insight into the counterbalancing role of reflexivity, operating at both individual and collective levels of analysis, in generating the ability of entrepreneurs to overcome the constraints of imprinting.

Data for this study were collected from 791 undergraduate business management students. The results show a greater entrepreneurial culture in Puerto Rico, except for the fear of entrepreneurship factor, where the scores are similar in both countries. Sex and age influence self-perception of entrepreneurial culture. However, this self-perception in Puerto Rican students is only influenced by training courses on entrepreneurship-related skills, while in Spain, it is impacted by students’ having done extracurricular internships and not having participated in international work teams. The influence of the Dunning-Kruger effect and cultural, economic and social characteristics could be important. This study has relevant implications for universities and for institutional policy-making. It is imperative to design and adapt educational programmes to improve the self-perception of entrepreneurship culture and thus align with students' needs and aspirations for higher quality entrepreneurship.}

Firms are increasingly held accountable for the welfare of workers across entire supply chains and so it is surprising that standard forms of governance for socially sustainable supply chain management have not yet emerged. Assessment initiatives have begun to develop as a proxy measure of social sustainable supply chain management. This research aims to examine how social sustainability assessment initiatives instigate and use institutional pressures to drive third-party accreditation as the legitimate means of demonstrating social sustainability in a global supply chain.
Design/methodology/approach
Ten assessment initiatives focused on assuring social sustainability across supply chains are examined. Data are collected through interviews with senior managers and publicly available secondary material.
Findings
The findings show how the social sustainability assessment initiatives act by instigating institutional pressures indirectly rather than directly. Coercive pressures are the most prevalent and are exerted through consumer and compliance requirements. The notion of pressures operating as a chain is proposed, and the recognition that actors within and outside of a supply chain are crucial to the institutionalization of social sustainability is discussed.
Originality/value
Studies on sustainable supply chain management often focus on how companies sense and act upon institutional pressures. To add to the extant body of knowledge, this study focuses on the sources of the pressures and demonstrates how assessment initiatives use coercive, normative and mimetic pressures to drive the adoption of social sustainability assessment in supply chains.}

We use Bruner's (1991) theory of narrative to frame the institution building process which we term deliberative instauration in recognition of the historic literature on the subject. We further link the process of institution building to Vygotsky's theory of social mediation and the use of artefacts in relation to the object of intended action.

Yet, as entrepreneurial actors use CDTs to showcase innovative self-narratives, advancing these projects locally requires the negotiated ‘enrolment’ of various organizational partners. In these interactions, entrepreneurs flexibilize the definitions of their projects in order to adaptat to institutional obduracy. This is found to be a recursive cycle in which flexibility and stability in the organization of urban networks are self-reinforcing. While urban laboratory projects like the CDT may support the advancement of a certain 'innovative' symbolic order, the interaction between (1) flexible project definitions and experimental relationships on the one hand and (2) stable institutions and sustained narratives on the other often produces ephemeral experiences over lasting infrastructural or institutional change. The study finds that the enactment of the urban laboratory reinforces a “sandbox” approach to urban governance in which projects are constantly renewed but never completed. Through a discussion of this ‘sandbox urbanism,’ the research offers a critical view of the social entropy generated by the laboratorization of urban governance.}

Why did a powerful department of hospital doctors support a merger with a rival hospital that they knew would ruin their beloved workplace?
Design/methodology/approach
This ethnographic study draws on 12 months of fieldwork consisting of 24 one-on-one interviews as well as 26 h of observations, informal conversations and archival records research to answer its research question. Grounded theory and the discourse analysis were employed to analyze all data.
Findings
Data reveal how participants' belief in a “merge or go bankrupt” narrative contributed to widespread support for a merger that seemed unthinkable on the surface. Although each doctor believes the merger will jeopardize or ruin their workplace culture, none resisted the merger nor did any ask hospital executives to provide evidence in support of their claims regarding the benefits of the merger (namely, that it would save their organization from inevitable bankruptcy).
Research limitations/implications
The author relied on a family relative to introduce the author to and gain entry into this workplace. One potential consequence is biased interpretations of data. To address this, the author constantly revisited the data and compared the author’s interpretations with interviewees' words (i.e. “grounded” theory).
Originality/value
This study provides empirical and theoretical contributions to organizational storytelling scholarship.}

This is a review paper. It adopts a different multi-dimensional, qualitative methodology to examine China’s trajectory of innovation from the economic reform since 1978, highlighting “China” experiences in the developing innovation-driven economy, also pointing the challenges that China faces in this transition process and future prospects. The analysis of China’s innovation performance was based mostly on secondary data from sources and institutions that use statistical data to build country rankings, such as the global innovation index and global competitiveness index.
Findings
It is found that the institutional foundations of the national innovation system in China are already being laid, and so far, China has made extraordinary progress regarding innovation performance from country to region and from business to individual. However, some critical challenges in its innovation-driven development still need urgent attention and effective efforts to reinforce them.

From evolutionary economic geography (EEG), scholars have emphasized the processes underlying the formation of new energy paths in energy system transitions. These processes have been well studied in Global North countries, but insights into the processes shaping the energy transition in sub-Saharan Africa are still limited. This study provides a contribution to fill that gap by exploring the emerging energy paths in Senegal through the lens of EEG, using the framework of regional path creation processes to analyze qualitative interview data from 17 experts in the Senegalese energy sector. Senegal is an instructive country to study, as its energy sector is undergoing substantial reform that has accelerated the deployment of large-scale renewable energy projects in recent years. The study uncovers three parallel evolving energy paths stemming from path transplantation, indigenous path creation, and path upgrading. Each path differs greatly in its legitimation and in the role of institutions as enablers. These results not only contribute to the ongoing scientific debate; but also provide insights for development agencies, national and regional institutions, NGOs and private actors involved in the Senegalese energy system.}

While previous conceptualizations of institutional theory focus on the direct constraint of institutions on HRM, institutional logics emphasizes complexity, multilevel dynamics, and agency. Similarly, institutional work addresses agency at the day-to-day level, exploring how actors create, maintain, and disrupt the institutional contexts in which they are embedded.

Estimates reveal that listed firms tend to recycle a larger proportion of their waste in countries with a high level of political accountability that are also politically more stable. In such countries, the voting power of citizens can put pressure on politicians to monitor more effectively the waste management of large listed firms. Therefore, political actors can have a major role in increasing a firm's level of recycled waste by providing a more predictable political agenda and by monitoring more effectively the ecological impact of firms.}

Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to the relation that can exist between the spatial context and the entrepreneurial activities. Specifically, institutions and the space of entrepreneurial activities in a country have rarely been considered as a whole. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between these two aspects and seeks to examine the entrepreneurial activity in rural areas in comparison with urban areas based on the formal and informal institutions in an emerging economy such as Colombia. It claims that the formal institutions affect rural and urban entrepreneurs differently, examining the moderating effect of the informal institutions on this relation. Using a hierarchical logic model with panel data, 30 cities in Colombia over the period 2000–2013 are used as samples to explore the differences between rural and urban areas. It is found that the informal institutions achieve greater influence in the rural areas; these areas are favored to a greater extent by the social norms, since they are smaller territories with greater integration between citizens. However, the existence of subjective and objective insecurity affects rural entrepreneurial activity in a wider scope than urban entrepreneurial activity, decreasing the creation of new ventures.}

Inspired by positioning theory, which has its roots in symbolic interactionism, we analyse how positions are invoked in the actors’ various actions and statements (‘speech acts’) and how they draw from the mutually constructed narratives (‘storylines’) that enable and constrain the range of possible positions. We analyse, over time, the positioning of three Dutch systemic intermediaries in agriculture, energy production, and healthcare. We conclude that systemic intermediaries move together with the promise of the field and, as a consequence, have to reposition themselves. In different phases, they both profit and suffer from the dilemma between initiating and sustaining innovative systemic changes.}

Alongside the void-filling discussed in the literature, we identify three other institutional strategies of these businesses: they also maintain and expand and create institutional voids. The platform companies’ institutional work has formed a market that is more efficient, effective, complete and formalised. At the same time, though, they have institutionalised problematic behaviours and significant inequalities. They have done this by internally institutionalising – within the digital platform and in their broader business model – previously-distributed market functions and power. We suggest some practical actions to address the downsides of platformisation through the filling of ongoing voids, and we identify some research priorities for future studies of institutional voids and platforms in developing countries.}

abstract = {Purpose
The complexity of contemporary societal challenges in emerging countries reanimates the necessity of collective action to resolve them. What is required is system change, namely, transformations in policy, practice, power relationships, market dynamics and social customs that underlie social and environmental issues. Technological innovations, paired with intentional social changes, might play a transformative role in this effort. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the adoption of technologies in social enterprises (SEs) and their contribution to achieving system change. It also addresses the effects of their hybrid nature on this relationship.
Design/methodology/approach
The analysis relied on data collected through a survey of the global population of Ashoka fellows, which is largely based in emerging economies. Three models were developed concerning different pathways to achieve system change identified in the theoretical framework. These were tested using Probit regressions.
Findings
The investigation confirms that technology can support SEs in navigating complex pathways to achieve system change rather than merely enabling linear scaling operational strategies. The pursuit of economic value creation, in conjunction with a social mission, decreases the ability of SEs to achieve system change. This is because the scaling paths which hardly create revenues are neglected.
Originality/value
The study conceptualises a multifaceted model of system change. It tests the framework empirically to show that SEs can adopt technologies to unleash complex system change processes to generate societal impact, on top of merely demonstrating linear approaches to scaling or replication. The paper questions the capacity of SEs to facilitate system change without appropriate financial support and the inherent tensions between hybridity and the depth of system change dynamics.}

This paper aims to investigate the actions and activities undertaken by public managers of a local government to institutionalise an externally mandated performance measurement and management (PMM) system in a developing country.
Design/methodology/approach
A qualitative case study of one of the best-ranked early adopters of PMM in a local government in Indonesia was undertaken, with interviews with public officers at various organisational levels, along with an extensive documentary review. An institutional work perspective was used to explain the types of work undertaken to institutionalise PMM at the organisation.
Findings
The PMM change was shown to be centralised and directed from the top and facilitated by other public officers. The Mayors’ instrumental and political view of PMM as a tool for efficiency and societal legitimacy enabled the adoption of PMM. The political and cultural work of the Mayor and the key officers involved constructing new rules pertaining to PMM, specifically in dealing with resource allocation and its associated sanctions and rewards, which encouraged more substantive implementation. The substantive implementation of PMM had a significant influence on the norms and values of the local government.
Research limitations/implications
The case organisation is the local government of a relatively medium-sized city. Therefore, it may be easier to achieve tighter control and coordination as compared to the local government of other larger cities.
Originality/value
The paper highlights the interrelated nature of institutional work in the creation and disruption of institutions. In addition, the three main types of institutional work, i.e. political, cultural and technical work, are not mutually exclusive. The paper also indicates the processes involved in the implementation of PMM, which unfolds from the establishment of a policy, its impact, and the role of the actors in the process.}

We explore two contrasting empirical case studies of national organic trajectories: Uganda and Benin. In both countries, organic agriculture emerged in the 1980s around food security stakes and spread in the 1990s through certified export value chains, with a faster development in Uganda than in Benin. From a theoretical perspective, this paper proposes an original analytical grid to study national trajectories of institutionalization of organic farming in Africa, based on three main variables: the policy regime in place in the country (including socio-economic and agrifood dimensions); the relative interest of public and private foreign actors in organic agriculture; and the strength of the national organic agriculture movement. Our results show that the degree of institutionalization of the Green Revolution paradigm in the country is of capital importance for explaining developments in organic farming, particularly its materialization through the increasing use of synthetic inputs: institutionalizing organic farming means deinstitutionalizing agrochemicals. We also show that the high level of extraversion of organic agriculture development in Africa through its focus on certified export value chains raises long-term questions of farmers' empowerment and of local consumers/citizens' access to local organic food. Finally, national organic agriculture movements can play a crucial role by politicizing certain issues in national public debate, such as pesticides' impacts on human and environmental health, and by advising governments in organic policy framing and implementation. Applying the proposed socio-political analytical grid to new national or regional African case studies will help to further enrich the empirical knowledge on organic food and farming in Africa.}

Responding to this call, this paper employs Bourdieu’s theory of practice to investigate entrepreneurship in two UK cities: Liverpool and Kingston upon Hull (Hull). By adopting an abductive approach, we shed light on shared practical understandings and multi-practitioner entrepreneurial activities. Using the concept of a 'field of entrepreneurship' to elucidate entrepreneurial contexts, our study reveals the dynamics within these settings that encourage agents to engage in entrepreneurial endeavours. In Liverpool, an autonomizing process is observed, wherein agents are drawn into entrepreneurship due to factors such as perceived social capital, ease of access, and adherence to a self-help doxa or ethos. Conversely, in Hull, perceived low entrepreneurial activity prompts agents to form formal alliances and initiatives to bolster the entrepreneurial landscape, leading to a distinct form of homological alliance-building. This research brings a unique empirical application of practice theory to the study of entrepreneurship and context, offering insights into the interplay between agency and structure. By uncovering shared practices facilitating entrepreneurial activities across different contexts, our findings enrich our understanding of entrepreneurial dynamics and inform strategies for fostering entrepreneurship.}

abstract = {Purpose
Although the generation of social value is the focus of social entrepreneurship, little research attention is paid on how social value and transformation can be created. By adopting a market approach, this study aims to develop a framework showing how social enterprises in tourism/hospitality can generate social value and transformation.
Design/methodology/approach
A thorough literature review revealed that a market approach is an appropriate lens for understanding social entrepreneurship. Consequently, a framework based on “learning with the market” is proposed as a useful tool for identifying, managing and also creating (new) opportunities for social ventures. The justification and the theoretical underpinnings of the market-based framework are further supported by discussing various other theories and concepts.
Findings
The framework identifies three capabilities that social entrepreneurs need to develop for generating social value and transformation: network structure, market practices and market pictures. Several examples from tourism and hospitality social enterprises are analyzed for showing the applicability and usefulness of the framework.
Research limitations/implications
The paper proposes a conceptual framework as well as several research directions for further testing, refining and expanding it.
Practical implications
By applying the framework on several tourism and hospitality social enterprises, the paper provides practical implications about the capabilities that social enterprises should develop for engaging with other market actors to identify and exploit (new) market opportunities for social value co-creation, and influence market plasticity for forming new markets and driving social change.
Social implications
The suggested framework identifies the capabilities and the ways in which (tourism/hospitality) social enterprises can engage with and form markets for co-creating social value and escalating their social impacts through social transformation.
Originality/value
The paper provides a new marketing approach (that overcomes the limitations of traditional economic theories) for understanding how social enterprises can shape, manage and engage with social markets for generating social value.}
