abstract = {In order to justify high expenditure during this period of financial crisis, Space Agencies have attempted to increase the returns on their investments in Space missions by encouraging the commercial use of advanced technologies. The development of a technology transfer process from Space to Earth not only benefits the Aerospace industry but also the network of national companies. Technology transfer has been shown to stimulate innovation in business and commerce, support economic growth and provide a return on public investment in research and development (R&D). The aim of this paper is to systematically review the Space technology transfer literature and to suggest directions for future research. The range of research and studies in the literature on this topic requires a systematic review to summarize the results in an unbiased and balanced manner and to interpret these in a way that highlights the research gaps. This article presents an overview of the dominant thinking (explicit in selected articles from 1995 to present), indicating the problems of analysis, research gaps and a future research program.}

Evaluating a country's institutional EO allows entrepreneurs to understand how embedded the institution is within a certain technology (in this case blockchain technology), which in turn, signals to entrepreneurs longer-term havens in which to locate to develop and commercialize the technology.}

abstract = {Purpose
Research on the diffusion and adaptation of LGBT diversity management practices has, until now, rarely considered the role of unions in this process; where it has done, the consideration has largely been cursory or tangential. In order to contribute towards overcoming this research gap, the purpose of this paper is to focus more closely on this issue, within the Italian context.
Design/methodology/approach
Theoretically based on the notion of institutional entrepreneurship, the paper analyses the ways in which trade unions contribute to the diffusion of LG-inclusive policies. Empirically this study is based on qualitative interviews with representatives from the unions, LGBT activists and individuals from those companies that have received support from the unions in terms of shaping their initiatives.
Findings
Italian unions act as institutional entrepreneurs in the sexual orientation field by framing the issue of the inclusion of LGBT workers as an issue of including minority groups under the broad umbrella of equality in workplaces, and by cooperating with LGBT associations. The latter provides the unions with two different things. First, with more legitimacy, from the viewpoint of LGBT employees; second, with the specific competencies in dealing with these issues. The accomplishments of the unions consist of arranging single agreements concerning the establishment of “punishment systems” for discriminatory behaviours, rather than promoting inclusion-oriented behaviours within the organization.
Originality/value
This paper highlights the role of unions, and in doing so, focusses on a hitherto marginalized actor in the process of adapting LGBT diversity initiatives. In focussing on the Italian context, it adds an important perspective to a discourse that has previously consisted of predominantly Anglo-American views.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how sustainable entrepreneurs (SEs) address the regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive institutional pillars when operating in conservative contexts. It aims to study in depth the use of sustainable innovation (SI) as a means of increasing legitimacy within the institutions, thus triggering an institutional change.
Design/methodology/approach
The paper opted for an exploratory study on the Tuscan geothermal heat pumps market, which presents a promising but still largely unexploited sustainability potential despite its low institutional support, using the open-ended approach of grounded theory. The data include interviews and archive data, such as newspapers, magazines.
Findings
The paper provides empirical insights on how sustainable institutional entrepreneurs (SIEs) have developed innovative business models based on direct relationship with the final customers and strategic partnerships as a means of increasing legitimacy within the normative and cultural-cognitive institutions, and subsequently in the regulative institutions, through: innovative value propositions aimed at changing industry norms and social beliefs; increasing the private benefit of innovative sustainable business models in order to trigger imitation dynamics; inter-sector strategic partnerships sharing the same sustainability objectives; the inclusion of the relevant actors in relation to the social norms and cultural-cognitive barriers in a value proposition. On the basis of these findings a model has been developed.
Research limitations/implications
The study enriches the sustainable entrepreneurship research stream by providing empirical evidence on how SEs foster changes in the three institutional pillars with SI. It also contributes to the institutional entrepreneurship research by extending the results of previous studies regarding institutional tactics.
Practical implications
The paper could help SIEs prioritizing changes in value propositions and strategic partnerships to create market-based coalitions, as a means of institutional legitimization for SI.
Originality/value
The study illustrates the relationship between the sustainable institutional entrepreneurial practices and each institutional pillar, including the cultural-cognitive institutions, which have been neglected in previous research. This allows formulating five key propositions that guide SEs in succeeding as both sustainable and institutional entrepreneurs.}

abstract = {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to apply the theoretical lens of liminality to a consideration of non-traditional entrepreneurial locations. The study exemplifies such locations by empirically exploring self-storage based businesses: that is, businesses that operate for a significant number of hours each week from self-storage facilities.
Design/methodology/approach
– The study draws on interviews with entrepreneurs operating self-storage based businesses and operators of self-storage facilities. The interview data is supported by site visits, businesses’ websites, promotional and marketing materials and press coverage.
Findings
– Consistent with the liminal lens, entrepreneurs view their time operating from self-storage as a transitional phase. They do not suffer the high levels of uncertainty and unsettledness usually associated with liminality. However, they experience anxiety related to perceptions of operating from a business location outside the mainstream. Whilst the entrepreneurs benefit from additional services provided by the self-storage operators, this may be at the expense of extra “liminal” work and anxiety experienced by the storage operators’ staff.
Originality/value
– The study contributes to entrepreneurship by answering Steyaert and Katz’s (2004) call for studies in unfamiliar places and spaces. The authors identify a number of ways in which liminality can arise when considering entrepreneurial locations. Drawing on extant entrepreneurial studies, the authors theorise that idiosyncratic characteristics of such spaces attract entrepreneurs with particular personal characteristics and needs, who will in turn be influenced by those spaces. In the case of self-storage facilities, the liminal space allows trepidatious entrepreneurs to “try on” (Hawkins and Edwards, 2015, p. 39) operating a new venture.}

We identify five main distinguishing TIP characteristics and analyse the literature's understanding of how they influence the policymaking process. The analysis shows that the literature discusses TIP-related challenges in all stages of the policy cycle but does not provide much guidance on how to address key cross-cutting policymaking challenges such as how to achieve broad stakeholder involvement, evaluate transformative outcomes, and build up dynamic policymaker capabilities. In order for TIP ideas to be implemented in real-life policymaking, TIP scholars, therefore, need to more explicitly consider the practitioners’ perspective and develop concrete models, tools and guidelines that help policymakers address the identified challenges.}

This study aims to examine how spatial contexts, institutions and entrepreneurial self-identity affected the formation of entrepreneurial intentions of a sample of students in Zimbabwe.
Design/methodology/approach
Data were obtained from 284 students enrolled in two vocational education institutions located in Midlands Province of Zimbabwe. To select the respondents, convenience sampling was used. The sample size was determined by the total number of students agreeing to participate in the research. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling (maximum likelihood estimation method).
Findings
Social approval, supportive cultural environment and entrepreneurial self-identity had positive statistically significant direct effects on entrepreneurial intentions. Also, entrepreneurial self-identity partially mediated the effects of social approval and supportive cultural environment on entrepreneurial intentions. The total effect of supportive higher education institutions on entrepreneurial intentions was statistically significant, despite the direct and indirect effects being non-significant.
Practical implications
The findings suggest a need to cultivate supportive social contexts and higher education institutions for nurturing entrepreneurial self-identity and entrepreneurial intentions, factors that are integral to the development of future entrepreneurs.
Originality/value
The study examined the validity of a novel conceptual model based on the contribution of entrepreneurial self-identity, spatial context and institutional variables in shaping entrepreneurial intentions of selected college students in the global south.}

Using qualitative methods and building upon institutional perspectives of sustainable change, we show how being confronted with adverse poverty and pollution in local contexts can drive an entrepreneurial university to develop a sustainability vision that accordingly becomes the driver of institutional change. We demonstrate how local campus leadership, a holistic teaching and research programme, and student involvement can have significant local effects over the short term. However, we also show how liabilities of smallness hinder the creation of significant sustainable local impact. Instead, the campus becomes an incubation space for novel institutional practices for regional development. Indeed, the most promising initiatives return to the original campus for scaling up. This study helps to characterize the entrepreneurial university by first presenting universities as drivers for sustainable change through education and outreach, rather than via traditional commercialization activities and notably in developing countries. Second, the study illustrates the risks and value of creating a separate space for novel concepts for sustainable development to be tested prior to returning these concepts to the principal location.}

By taking the digital economy industry in Guangzhou City as a case, this study reveals that given the different initial conditions, innovative entrepreneurship, institutional entrepreneurship and place-based leadership have paid distinct and dynamic roles in different specific contexts and phases. In the well-developed core district (Tianhe) gathered universities and research institutes, innovative entrepreneurs have acted as initial drivers for the development of the digital economy industry at the early path creation phase, while institutional entrepreneurs also provided support to enhance the industrial agglomeration in the following periods. In the late-developing peripheral district (Huangpu) with the lack of innovative resources, institutional entrepreneurship and place-based leadership are crucial to nurturing the new digital industry in the early phase, while conducive industrial assets and innovative entrepreneurs are also needed to cultivate the development of new industries in the future. Therefore, a longitude and multi-actor approach is needed to understand regional industrial path creation in different geographical contexts.}

This study examines the challenges and successes of implementing and sustaining lesson study (LS) as an approach to in-service teacher professional development (PD) in primary schools in Portugal and England, highlighting the impact of institutional contexts.
Design/methodology/approach
Two schools that used LS as an approach to PD over a period of at least three years were identified. The theoretical framework of institutionalism guided the methodology and analysis of findings, seeking to explore relationships between institutionalised PD practices at national and school level, and how interactions between actors in schools helped or hindered the institutionalism of LS. The qualitative case studies included document analysis, observations of LS practices and interviews with teachers and leaders engaging in LS.
Findings
The findings reveal the importance of institutional entrepreneurs, who create a narrative to support LS, allocate resources to enable it and create a “relational space”, in which it can be tested and tweaked before sharing with others in the school. An institutional entrepreneur is particularly vital when national regulatory frameworks prescribe specific PD types that are not conducive to LS (such as in Portugal). However, even in more open frameworks, the entrepreneur needs to frame the LS model to fit institutionalised expectations.
Originality/value
This study, with its analysis of strategies that support sustained use of LS in schools, advances the growing field of LS research. This field of research is moving its focus from short-term LS projects that concentrate on immediate impact on teachers and students, to a sustainable approach that uses LS for in-service, school-based teacher PD, a practice with a long history in Japan.}

By reviewing 34 articles in 18 journals over a 22-year period, we establish what shapes CSI by social change agents, and the conditions for, and consequences of such innovations in MNEs. The review demonstrates that CSI by MNEs is triggered by institutional contradictions or a market opportunity, shaped by (in)formal resources and skills deployed to generate ideas, piloted through multistakeholder engagement, and legitimated through showcasing and framing to generate impact that contributes to SDGs. Our findings set an agenda for future research on the links between CSI activities and different CSI stages and the complex dynamics arising in MNE strategies aimed at reconciling opposing institutional logics and the impact of MNE home institutional contexts.}

Using survey data collected from 195 Chinese firms, the study concludes that institutional support and institutional entrepreneurial opportunity recognition represent two significant mediating mechanisms by which managerial political ties can result in improved firm performance. But, though a reliance on political utilization enhances organizational regulatory legitimacy, the results show that regulatory legitimacy does not directly contribute to firm performance.

Our analysis sheds light on how a social enterprise gradually transforms itself to better contribute to the sustainable development of its territory and the mobilization of local citizens. It also shows that a different form of local development 'by and for local people' is possible.

abstract = {This paper focuses on building a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the state of social entrepreneurship (SE) research by using an integrated bibliometric and unsupervised machine learning approach. Bibliometric analysis, along with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling enables us to identify key trends and themes in the SE domain. This approach is superior to tools and methods used in the past, which primarily employed systematic literature reviews and bibliometric analysis. While systematic manual literature reviews become impractical as the literature grows, bibliometric analysis focuses on the most cited articles, ignoring recent influential work, suffering from citation biases, and giving more weight to impact over thematic discovery. The methodology used by us overcomes these issues by first extracting large amounts of information through advanced computational methods and then using unsupervised machine learning to discover the latent themes and topics in this large collection of publications. This research uses the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases to extract corpora of 3844 texts (titles, abstracts, and keywords) from published research on SE. We decipher the key trends in the literature and segregate them into three broad categories – individual attributes and motivation, organizational actions, and institutional conditions and development, with 21 sub-topics to enhance the understanding of this field of inquiry. This study is the first in the entrepreneurship domain to use this integrated approach to review the literature, and the findings lay the groundwork for future research.}

The emerging discourse on nature-based solutions (NBS) – multifunctional nature-integrated spatial planning and design innovations – raises the question to what extent TIS can account for the development and diffusion of NBS. Following a literature review, we present the Nature-Based Innovation System (NBIS) framework delineating critical factors for urban nature-based innovation. We find both commonalities and differences between TIS and NBIS, suggesting that the roles of place-based dynamics, agency and governance structure are more central to nature-based innovation, and market formation is more central to technological innovation. This has implications for the study of sustainability transitions, which has likely underplayed the potential of innovations at the nexus of socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. Future research is needed to refine the NBIS framework, for example by studying evolutionary developmental trajectories.}

Design/methodology/approach
A systematic multi-disciplinary review of 144 papers that are categorized into six scholarly conversations to build the foundation for a critical discussion of each line of inquiry.
Findings
This paper identifies six conversations or research streams at the intersection of entrepreneurship and resilience: resilience as traits or characteristics of entrepreneurial firms or individuals, resilience as a trigger for entrepreneurial intentions, entrepreneurial behavior as enhancing organizational resilience, entrepreneurial firms fostering macro-level (regions, communities, economies) resilience, resilience in the context of entrepreneurial failure, and resilience as a process of recovery and transformation. The review revealed these publications imprecisely define constructs and use a limited amount of the extant scholarship on both entrepreneurship and resilience. Future research should take a more holistic approach to explore entrepreneurship and resilience from a multi-level and longitudinal perspective, especially in the context of socio-ecological sustainability.
Originality/value
This paper incorporates insights on resilience and entrepreneurship across academic disciplines to show how future contributions could benefit by incorporating research from other fields. In doing so, it provides a starting point for more nuanced discussions around the interrelationships between the different conversations and the role entrepreneurs can play in promoting a positive, long-term trajectory for a socio-ecological system.}

This new approach to public management sought to enhance the government's performance and fulfil public needs resourcefully. The concept of corporate entrepreneurship (CE) in the public sector, i.e., public entrepreneurship (PE), was therefore introduced. This study aims to synthetize the literature on this topic and establish a research agenda on the PE field. By adapting hybrid approach based on a systematic and bibliometric literature review, the paper presents the results of four main bibliometric techniques: citation and co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and co-word analysis, all of which were used by means of VosViewer software and the Bibliometrix (including Biblioshiny application) package for statistical program language R. This theme-centric review of 84 publications published in flagship journals reveals the intellectual domain of CE in the public sector, highlighting key theoretical concepts, principal research topics, the methodologies employed, the geographical span of the domain, and proposed future research avenues. This paper offers a comprehensive review of CE in the intellectual domain of the public sector. It presents fruitful research avenues with regards to the ways in which public entrepreneurial success is related to adjustability to broader political and institutional perspectives; how territorial innovation theories deal with increased resource mobility; and how a lean government could enhance civil engagement and public involvement.}

The purpose of this paper is to use a unique set of measures from Holmes et al. (2013) to clarify the relationship between entrepreneurial readiness and entrepreneurial behaviours across countries and determine whether formal institutions moderate this relationship.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses data collected by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, the Index of Economic Freedom, Political Risk Services, and the Freedom House and Political Constraint Index to test a theoretical model. A multilevel analysis is performed based on set of 377,356 observations from 51 countries spanning eight years (2001-2008).
Findings
The results suggest that entrepreneurial readiness has a strong relationship with entrepreneurial behaviour (as measured by entrepreneurial entry and opportunity-based entrepreneurship) and that this relationship strengthens with increases in political democracy (PD), government regulations (GR), financial capital availability (FCA) and market liquidity (ML).
Research limitations/implications
The study is based on Holmes et al.’s (2013) institutions that are most important for society, uses satisfactory sample size and multi-level modelling. However, many more institutional conditions that remain to be considered might affect entrepreneurial activities.
Practical implications
For policy-makers, the results show that PD, GR, FCA and ML correlate favourably with entrepreneurial behaviour when individuals have a high level of entrepreneurial readiness. Policy-makers should introduce policies that provide a secure environment to individuals to start their own ventures.
Originality/value
The current study is among the first to examine the three dimensions of formal institutions—political, regulatory, and economic institutions—in a single study. Using the three dimensions, the study explains theoretically and examines empirically the effect of individual-level entrepreneurial readiness on entrepreneurial behaviour.}

By connecting insights from the PPP and institutional entrepreneurship literatures, two main contributions are made. First, it is demonstrated that the process of institutional entrepreneurship goes well beyond the agentic powers of a few institutional entrepreneurs, and entails the collaborative actions of several actors working across multiple institutional fields. Second, the study emphasizes the importance of theorizing the implementation of PPP projects as a cognitive and a social undertaking in which social actors actively address the institutional and technical constraints that obstruct PPP projects.}

The study is set in the geographical context of three small and old industrial towns, where traditional industrial practices are embedded in the material and institutional environment and people's behaviours that form a distinctive industrial culture. Conceptually, we use a relational perspective to investigate the dialectic between human agency and industrial culture: we examine how industrial culture can guide human agency–through motivation, legitimation, or specific behaviour; and how human agency reshapes industrial culture through its actions–destruction, modification, maintenance of cultural assets. The results show that a strong industrial culture implies a more reproductive type of agency and a pronounced collective behaviour of actors, aiming at a more incremental development that reflects the existing place-based culture. In the case where industrial culture is thinner, new development relied on individual agents completely altering development paths. Our research places particular emphasis on collective assets and collective agency in the context of smaller towns with strong industrial culture and their ability to influence the direction of future development. In addition, we emphasise the simultaneous role of (individual) change and (collective) reproductive/maintenance agency, which can lead to stable development without major disruptions to the institutional or cultural context. Our findings are important for understanding small industrial communities and how the collective aspects of industrial culture require that new development initiatives are aligned with industrial traditions and place-based culture.}

Despite considerable attention on this matter, contributions have not explored the policy process of directionality, nor examined empirical cases to study directionality in practice. Considering these gaps, this paper presents an in-depth case study of the Dutch Automated Driving initiative that was developed under a smart mobility agenda with transformative aims (2013–2018). This initiative was rapidly championed by policymakers, and the agenda geared almost exclusively to its development. To study the policy processes therein, we used an adapted version of the Multiple Streams Framework (MS) (Kingdon, 1984). MS suggests that directions of policy change are determined by institutional entrepreneurs who have access to policy venues. We found that these entrepreneurs used political strategies (e.g. framing, problem-solution coupling) to champion automated vehicles as a transformative technology. However, eventually the transformative potential promises were not kept, leading to policy failure. In contrast, entrepreneurs’ self-interests dominated the policy implementation phase. This paper suggests that more attention should be given in how directions set in the early policy phases can be kept throughout the policy process.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology has seen increasingly important practical applications. The literature has expanded greatly in the past four to five years. One area that has seen significant application and growth is in supply chain management—which includes transportation and logistics. The growth of this literature has also resulted in several literature reviews—each has specific scope and emphasis. Of the growing number of literature review and bibliometric analysis studies, the focus has ranged from understanding application cases, themes, trends, and methodologies. Theoretical developments and theorizing have been limited for supply chain management in general and even more limited for sustainable supply chains. Arguably, much of the current research has been relatively atheoretical—a lack of theory development and theory application. Hence, we conclude the existing blockchain research discourse has been centered around application and less around the theory. As a sub-discipline, the nexus of blockchain and supply chain management is still in the early developmental stages. Using a critical synthesis review of the literature, this paper focuses on the most popular theories that have been applied to explain blockchain adoption and implementation within supply chains—how each theory explains the motivations, formalizes the organizational process around the acceptance of blockchain technology, and predicts the outcomes of blockchain-supported business models. Current theoretical gaps and potential future theorizing are discussed. Potential theories that have been used for other technologies (i.e., the internet of things) which have not been applied to the blockchain context are provided and discussed. The comprehensive and systematic theory review has important theoretical and managerial implications for both academia by advancing multiple academic disciplines and practice with insights into actual acceptance and usage of blockchain and other disruptive technologies.}

This paper aims to demonstrate that state shareholders are confronted with contradictory logics leading to institutional contradictions that activist shareholders can exploit. The competing logics of the state as shareholder and their impact on corporate governance and shareholder activism offer fertile grounds for research advances in Coordinated Market Economies (CMEs).
Design/methodology/approach
Through an extensive literature review of state ownership, institutional contradictions and shareholder activism, this paper analyzes two case studies involving the French State as shareholder.
Findings
In the French context, these two cases illustrate how institutional contradictions result in opportunities for shareholder activism. By focusing on the institutional contradictions of the state shareholder, this investigation suggests a need for experimental research to observe how shareholder activists adapt to each institutional change in CMEs. This experimentation can help policymakers to avoid creating additional conditions that shareholder activists can exploit.
Research limitations/implications
This focuses only on France and its state shareholdings. To generalize results, studies of other CMEs and state shareholders are needed.
Practical implications
Policymakers should consider all legislative proposals for their potential to deviate from corporate governance practice by experimenting with them in a laboratory setting. Shareholder activists can compare state shareholders’ actions against the state’s legislation to emphasize institutional contradictions that counter minority shareholders’ rights.

This research is the first to analyze how the state as shareholder can exploit its competing logics to resist against shareholder activism and support management or to become itself a shareholder activist.}

abstract = {Background
As technology is integrated into health care delivery, research on adoption and acceptance of health technologies leaves large gaps in practice and provides limited explanation of how and why certain technologies are adopted and others are not. In these discussions, the concept of legitimacy is omnipresent but often implicit and underdeveloped. There is no agreement about what legitimacy is or how it works across social science disciplines, despite a prolific volume of the literature centering legitimacy.
Objective
This study aims to explore the meaning of legitimacy in health and technology as conceptualized in the distinctive disciplines of organization and management studies, science and technology studies, and medical anthropology and sociology, including how legitimacy is produced and used. This allows us to critically combine insights across disciplines and generate new theory.
Methods
We conducted a critical interpretive synthesis literature review. Searches were conducted iteratively and were guided by preset eligibility criteria determined through thematic analysis, beginning with the selection of disciplines, followed by journals, and finally articles. We selected disciplines and journals in organization and management studies, science and technology studies, and medical anthropology and sociology using results from the Scopus and Web of Science databases and disciplinary expert–curated journal lists, focusing on the depth of legitimacy conceptualization. We selected 30 journals, yielding 796 abstracts.
Results
A total of 97 articles were included. The synthesis of the literature allowed us to produce a novel conceptualization of legitimacy as a form of social infrastructure, approaching legitimacy as a binding fabric of relationships, narratives, and materialities. We argue that the notion of legitimacy as social infrastructure is a flexible and adaptable framework for working with legitimacy both theoretically and practically.
Conclusions
The legitimacy as social infrastructure framework can aid both academics and decision makers by providing more coherent and holistic explanations for how and why new technologies are adopted or not in health care practice. For academics, our framework makes legitimacy and technology adoption empirically approachable from an ethnographic perspective; for decision makers, legitimacy as social infrastructure allows for a practical, action-oriented focus that can be assessed iteratively at any stage of the technology development and implementation process.}

abstract = {Systematizing corporate foresight and integrating it into decision-making is critical to harness its value. However, many companies face challenges due to limited legitimacy, leading to scarce resources and a lack of commitment. Previous research has paid little attention to various ways to develop foresight capability, particularly at the intermediate stage of foresight maturity, where legitimacy is often lacking. We address this issue by exploring alternative organizing models to demonstrate foresight's value within firms. We conceptualize a corporate foresight system (CFS) comprising structures, roles, and activities for managing futures knowledge. Through a multiple case study of eleven large companies with intermediate foresight maturity, we identify four legitimate CFS archetypes: function-driven, independent foresight unit, executive team-led, and platform-based models. Using 43 semi-structured interviews, a pre-questionnaire survey, and workshops, we characterize these archetypes, examine their strengths and weaknesses and identify ‘windows of opportunity’ for further legitimation by extending and refining an initial CFS. Theoretically, we develop the concept of CFS, identify four CFS archetypes for companies with intermediate foresight maturity, and discuss how they contribute to demonstrating foresight's value within firms. Practically, our findings provide guidance for managers seeking to develop foresight capability by identifying approaches to legitimize foresight within an organization.}

Structured according to these principles, this paper theorizes how soft power strategies can be a sufficient condition to overcome the embedded agency and mobilization problems of collective institutional entrepreneurship. The applicability is furthermore illustrated with a case of an institutional entrepreneurship initiative in the Dutch electro-technical installation industry. As such, the paper informs an undertheorized scenario of institutional entrepreneurship which we argue is more relevant for business markets than hard power approaches.}

However, the role of regional entrepreneurial spirit, which reflects local agency in arbitrage and innovation, has been largely ignored in shaping value-related economic activities. At the same time, new digital technologies provide the “opportunity window” for both firms and regions in the era of the digital economy. The issue of how regional entrepreneurial spirit exerts influence on global economic participation under the context of digitalization is worthy of further investigation. Thus, this study attempts to investigate the impacts of regional entrepreneurial spirit on local GVCs participation in China as well as the moderating role of digital transformation signals. With a big dataset matching from diversified sources, we find that regional entrepreneurial spirit has a significantly positive influence on local GVCs participation, which is moderated by the digital transformation signals from leading firms and local governments. In the early stages, the positive moderating effect from local governments is more stable and reliable, while leading firms' signals become more crucial in the latter stages. Furthermore, this moderating effect is more pronounced in cities with higher level of inclusiveness.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to build a holistic theoretical framework of enabling factors contributing to the development of enterprise in nanotechnology-related industries, in a French context.
Design/methodology/approach
A systematic literature review methodology was adopted. The review used three gauges to identify enabling factors contributing to the development of enterprise in nanotechnology-related industries in a French context: first, it analysed the literature related to the development of nanotechnologies in a perspective of sustainability in a multidisciplinary stance (“Green view”). Second, it took a disciplinary stance by exploring academic journals in the field of entrepreneurship (“Entrepreneurship view”). Third, it studied the perspective of France (“French view”).
Findings
The main finding is that in spite of different approaches and sometimes seemingly conflicting stances, the three views converge on three enabling factors: the importance of knowledge sharing across boundaries, access to university scientists and facilities, and government intervention. However, each view also has its particularities: the “Green view” emphasizes the need for civil society inclusion, the “Entrepreneurship view” underlines the importance of early stage capital and entrepreneurial behaviour and the “French view” concentrates on the role of clusters.
Research limitations/implications
The paper provides a theoretical framework and a starting point for further work on entrepreneurial nanotechnology facilitation. Its findings constitute a benchmark which may be tested in empirical cases. The focus on the French context may be seen as a limitation but also as a source of interesting comparative work focussing on other national or regional contexts.
Practical implications
The paper shows that public policy is an important element in the nascent field of enterprise development for nano-based materials. It outlines how different contexts create different barriers to entrepreneurship, and it proposes recommendations to overcome some of these barriers.
Originality/value
In this paper, findings result from an exploration of the nanotechnology literature that focusses solely on nanotechnology data sets and not on mixed data sets. The use of three different gauges leads to the construction of a holistic theoretical framework that includes enabling factors as well as the types of barriers that entrepreneurs have to overcome to succeed.}

abstract = {A key challenge in sustainability transitions research is to better understand the huge variety and spatial unevenness of transitions paths. Institutions and institutional change have been identified as critical issues, as regional institutional settings significantly influence the pace and scope of sustainability transitions. However, the complex institutional dynamics underpinning 'Regional Transition Paths to Sustainability' (RTPS) are not well understood. Underexplored is in particular the link between short time gradual changes on the micro-level and long-term transformative change on the system level. In order to add to a more profound understanding of these processes, a focus on organizational change is valuable. The basic argument made in this article is that the emergence of new temporary and more permanent forms of organization has the potential to enable de-institutionalization and new institutionalization processes simultaneously. As we will show, new organizational forms also serve as a means to make institutional dynamics visible. The contribution of this paper is thus twofold: By combining insights from sustainability transition theory, evolutionary economic geography and neoinstitutional organization theory, we develop an original conceptual framework. By developing and applying the methodological approach of a 'transition topology', the potential of this framework for comparative research on actors and processes in different regional transition path to sustainability is revealed.}

abstract = {Purpose
Little attention has been given specifically to the experience of women social entrepreneurs despite the assumption they are prone to “care”, and even less to their motivations or their self-perception of success. This paper aims to provide an insight into the relationship between motivations and social and economic performance among women social entrepreneurs in ten European Union countries.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper classifies the motivations of women social entrepreneurs, drawing on the results of a survey conducted (n = 380) by the European Women’s Lobby. The paper then examines how these motivations relate to self-perceptions of social and economic performance.
Findings
In addition to being driven by self-interest and prosocial motivations, women social entrepreneurs also seek to develop alternative business models. Where a social mission is central, women are likely to feel successful in meeting their social aim; however, there is a strong negative relationship between self-interested motivations and revenue.
Research limitations/implications
This analysis relies on perceptual and self-reported data; therefore, more objective measures should be considered for further research, possibly combined with a longitudinal design. Another limitation of this paper lies in the non-random sampling strategy used to identify a hard-to-reach population such as women social entrepreneurs.
Practical implications
The findings provide a better understanding of the motivations of women social entrepreneurs. This may be useful in assisting funding or support organisations, as well as social investors, evaluate where to best invest resources. In addition, a more nuanced understanding of motivations among women social entrepreneurs can inform policies aimed at supporting women social entrepreneurs, without necessarily being bound by the expectation to maximise economic and/or social outcomes.
Originality/value
This paper demonstrates the centrality of the social mission for women social entrepreneurs. The results also identify “seeking an alternative business model” as a key motivation among women social entrepreneurs, thereby breaking existing conceptualisations of entrepreneurial motivations on a binary spectrum as either “self-interested” or “prosocial”. The paper also shows that having other than prosocial motivations for becoming a social entrepreneur does not necessarily lead to higher economic revenue.}

We find that ‘lone hero’ institutional entrepreneurs who experience failure from working in relative isolation learn to acquire new resources and deploy them in new tactics leading to a more collective approach, which is necessary for disrupting the institutional gatekeeping work that maintains a mature cultural field.}

We find university entrepreneurship measures to have a positive effect on students’ climate perceptions, which also depend on students’ background and gender. In addition, we find evidence for different peer effects, depending on students’ affinity for entrepreneurship. For the general student population, including entrepreneurship content in their normal studies seems to be required to initiate a social process of sensemaking. However, students’ perception of the entrepreneurial climate only depend to a certain degree on intentional entrepreneurship measures. In our study, general university characteristics have the strongest influence on climate perceptions.

In several GLASS countries, IFRS are supplemented by national standards for micro-entities and cooperatives.

Drawing on an institutional logic perspective and based on an intriguing organizational change project of a state-owned company in China, we explored how institutional logic changes in organizational change projects. The results indicate that institutional change occurs through organizational deinstitutionalization, organizational institution building, and organizational reinstitutionalization across both individual and organizational levels. We developed a theory for successfully securing change efforts that relies on the level-crossing alteration of institutional logic that shackles employee behaviors. A model of institutional logic change is proposed to illustrate the organizational change carried out in the form of projects from an institutional logic perspective.

Institutional theories also seem to be gaining the attention of scholars investigating large, global, infrastructure projects as reported in engineering, management and construction journals. Increasingly, it is evident that the problem areas attached to these projects stretch beyond technical issues: they must be considered as socio-technical endeavours embedded in complex institutional frames. The authors suggest that studying how to deal with institutional differences in the environment of megaprojects has both theoretical and practical implications.}

abstract = {How actors embedded in institutions can change those institutions is known as the paradox of embedded agency. Although academic interest in embedded agency has increased in recent years, what enables actors to engage in embedded agency is still not well understood. One resource that may assist actors in realising embedded agency and overcoming political resistance by opponents to change is management accounting, as management accounting can—among other functions—serve as an important information resource for actors willing to engage in embedded agency. Although the existing literature may not explicitly refer to embedded agency, published research studies are likely to already contain some evidence of the role of management accounting as a resource in institutional work. Thus, this study seeks to survey and re-analyse the existing literature for evidence regarding how management accounting may be used as a political resource that enables embedded agency. For this purpose, the study uses systematic literature review methods and demonstrates why and how management accounting may serve as a political resource in institutional change. The study develops six roles concerning how management accounting may be used as a political resource in the identification of a need for and gaining others’ support for and the implementation of institutional change. It further shows that management accounting may be at interplay with other factors in enabling embedded agency. Finally, the review findings suggest that management accounting may be an important resource not only in legitimising institutional change ex post but also in identifying the need for change, gaining others’ support for change and implementing change.}

These four archetypes extend previous views and clarify the underlying commonalities and differences among different project governance studies. Moreover, we identify the practice turn and contextual turn as two promising shifts for conceptualizing the governance phenomenon as an ongoing process interacting with a broader societal context. Our findings will not only help scholars to recognize the lived experience and situated contexts of governing practices, but also encourage them to generate dialogs across different archetypes and the theory-practice gap.}

However, little is known about how institutional entrepreneurs engage differently in institutional strategies across different dynamic niche contexts. We distinguish between four different niche contexts: market-based niche development, market-based regime transformation, community-based niche development and community-based regime transformation. This typology is then conceptually combined with theory on institutional entrepreneurship and institutional work to examine the diverse agential processes of institutional change through which actors shape and transform their institutional environments. The usefulness of this framework is explored in an analysis of the low-carbon building stock in the Netherlands. The analysis demonstrates that the framework offers a comprehensive approach to examine variety in the arsenal of strategies of institutional work across different contexts.}

According to prior studies, the sharing of concepts, ideas and empirical domains with other disciplines may promote cross-fertilization. We challenge this one-sided view. Based on an analysis of the parallel development of the neighboring disciplines of innovation studies and project management, we show that the sharing of concepts and empirical domains can have ambivalent effects. Under conditions of ideological distancing, shared concepts and domains will be narrowly assimilated − an effect we call ‘encapsulation’ – which creates an illusion of sharing, while promoting further self-containment. By comparison, reflexive meta-theories and cross-disciplinary community-building will enable a form of sharing that promotes cross-fertilization. Our findings inform research on research specialization, cross-fertilization and effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration.}

Most of these makeshifts which are constructed on idle site unsuitable for long-term housing development are removed after a stipulated period for the site to be used for other purposes. With the growing supply of these short-term housing and potential increase in construction and demolition (C&D) waste, circular economy (CE) becomes necessary for waste reduction and material recovery for relocation and reconstruction. However, studies on drivers for circularity in transitional housing are limited. An institutional change is crucial to end the prevailing institutional structure of the linear economy, characterised by demolition, for CE implementation. Underpinned by the institutional theory framework, a comprehensive literature review and questionnaire survey were conducted to identify the institutional drivers for circular transitional housing. Findings of the study revealed highly rated common and significantly different regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive CE drivers. The findings complement extant literature in addition to apprising policymakers of a combined top-down (strategic) and bottom-up (tactical) drivers for circularity in residential facilities that serve as stopgaps. This could enable policymakers and practitioners to accelerate CE adoption in transitional housing and general construction projects. Beyond Hong Kong, the findings are relevant to international organizations to facilitate circular transitional housing markets or strategies in countries that are prone to natural disasters or in case of emergency to provide short-term shelter for vulnerable individuals, with less C&D waste generation during and after construction and deconstruction of such facilities.}

Exploratory bibliometric visuals and logistic regression reveal that regions with a tourism strategy and targeted strategies to support entrepreneurs predict tourism growth, specifically strategies for human capital development and tourism incubation programs.

Data was collected via questionnaires and interviews, resulting in five categories of factors that either help or hinder circular food business growth. A statistical correlation analysis is performed. The most successful businesses were those that operated in more than one stage of the food chain, had at least 2–3 years to stabilize their performance, and had financial investors. We explore that circular businesses strongly prioritize social and environmental goals and the impact of this when seeking (or avoiding) grants and other traditional business supports. Government and industry partners have a larger role to play in supporting circular businesses but must expand definitions of growth beyond economic metrics to effectively support the transition to a circular food system.}

Growing pressure on coastal and marine resources, international conservation targets set for 2020, and the persistence of ‘paper parks’ (i.e. only nominally declared) are some of the main reasons behind this trend. Based on the assumption that the prevalence of paper parks is associated with shortcomings in their institutional design, this article explores how institutional change theories, mainly from historical institutionalism, could add to the understanding of marine protected area governance. First, mechanisms leading to either stability or change of institutions are reviewed. Then, examples from existing literature are used to illustrate how these mechanisms might be preventing or enhancing the progress of marine protected areas. The focus is on developing countries where poorly functioning marine protected areas seem to be the norm rather than the exception. The analysis reveals that institutional change theories can be a helpful analytical tool to examine how institutions encompassing well-known challenges of marine protected areas, such as terrestrial conservation poorly adapted to marine ecosystems, imported conservation paradigms not fitting local realities, and difficulties posed by an incoherence of policies and top-down approaches to management, have developed over time. Conditions leading actors to notice these problems and take action to solve them as well as how they go about implementing changes are also explored. Finally, it is suggested that the issues raised here regarding the persistence of problems and how they are being tackled, especially those concerning the political process, can be beneficial to other fields of environmental governance.}

The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a ‘boundary object’; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts – and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly – this paper can act as a helpful ‘centering device’, connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.}

Therefore, this paper explores how the European institutions have incrementally legitimised tourism policy among Member States.
Findings
Over the years, the EU’s policies were intended to enhance the European single market whilst supporting the growth of the industrial competitiveness, sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship. This has inevitably led to the development of new policies in the realms of tourism.

While the structural embeddedness of intermediaries has been explored in innovation studies and economic geography literature, few transition studies have systematically examined how the agency of transition intermediaries is affected by institutional contexts. Without a deeper understanding of this interplay, the literature risks a naive perception of transition intermediaries as free agents. This study investigates transition intermediation in diverse institutional contexts using a typology of organizational fields that draws on institutional theory. Cases of local government commitments to fleet electrification and cycling infrastructure show that crises allow incumbent organizations to diverge from existing institutional arrangements and intermediate for systems change. Findings also indicate that the social position of transition intermediaries in a field can mute the enabling effect of crises on transition intermediation. Similarly, findings show that transition intermediaries can legitimize their visions for systems change by using collective action framing to draw attention to conflict between existing institutions to diverge from existing institutional arrangements. As such, this study provides new insight into conditions affecting the agency of transition intermediaries for low-carbon mobility transition.}

We study the VAMO scheme located in Fortaleza, Brazil, as the first e-carsharing scheme in the country. We study two policies combined: a VAMO planned growth policy and a retirement policy for conventional vehicles. Our results show that the VAMO incentive policy is an important factor to reduce emissions and to increase awareness of electric vehicles, highlighting the role of the government as an institutional entrepreneur, stimulating and sustaining the VAMO scheme. The retirement policy in combination with the VAMO incentive policy obtained the best results in our simulations, reducing 29% of CO2 emissions and increasing 36% electric vehicle adoption, when compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The main conclusions are that such e-carsharing schemes offer direct and indirect benefits to urban mobility (specially to electric vehicle adoption) and that they depend on how the government supports them.}

We use a meta-analytic structural equation modeling (meta-SEM) approach to analyze the proposed relationship. We consider 281 studies assessing 943,331 effect sizes to analyze the results. To investigate the relationship, we consider social exchange and resource-based theory. The results suggest that business (political) ties are positively (negatively) associated with operational performance, while both business and political ties are positively associated with innovation. Further, our result suggests that (a) approximately 14.2% of the effect of business ties on innovation is mediated by marketing capabilities and (b) industry type moderates the relationship between ties and performance. This study helps managers leverage managerial ties to improve firm performance and further suggests a proper mechanism through which firms can improve performance.}

This paper uses a combination of systematic and narrative procedures to review existing interpretive consumer research literature selectively. It aims to highlight the relative importance given to entrepreneurship as an influencing factor. The Theory of Cultural Entrepreneurship (TOCE) and an energetic account of desire are used to classify selected journal articles according to a thermodynamics-inspired fourfold typology: (1) COLD-Entrepreneurship|COLD-Consumption, (2) COLD-Entrepreneurship|HOT-Consumption, (3) HOT-Entrepreneurship|COLD-Consumption, and (4) HOT-Entrepreneurship|HOT-Consumption. The review concludes by suggesting avenues for further research.}

To test the value of political activism, recent scholarship has probed the impact of corporate political activity (CPA) on firm performance. However, mixed findings and the fragmented nature of the field raise more questions than answers as to the nature of this relationship. This systematic review examines scholarly articles for evidence of the impact of CPA on firm value. The findings suggest that CPA is more valuable in emerging countries and that relational CPA strategies are more common in emerging (versus developed) countries where social capital underlies political and economic exchange. We also document the paucity of research on informational CPA strategies and policy outcomes in the emerging country context. We consider the implications of these findings and others for local and multinational enterprises, and offer suggestions for further research.}

In this paper, we centre the analysis on how institutional contexts shape and influence adaptation limits as experienced by social actors. We emphasise institutions’ stability over time leading to delayed adaptation, their role in protecting more powerful rather than weaker social interests, and their tendency to generate punctuated rather than smooth changes in vulnerability to climate risks. We illustrate these arguments with two case studies of socio-ecological institutional regimes facing adaptation limits: water resources management in the Colorado River Basin; and disaster risk management in The Bahamas. These represent divergent risk governance contexts generating limits to adaptation for multiple social actors, despite the availability of plausible adaptation pathways. Our aim is to contribute to a generalisable approach to adaptation limits which can be applied in identifying and assessing critical choices in responses to growing climate change impacts.}

This study examines e-government towards digital era governance (DEG) and the actors involved in this transformational change. We draw upon the concept of ‘enactment’ as a lens to provide insights into relevant theoretical issues. These are operationalised through an enhanced Technology Enactment Framework (TEF) to consider reforms to explore the DEG environment and, specifically, the interventions of the CIO on e-government policies. We employed a case analysis approach from public sector authorities in the US States of California and Nevada with data from CIOs and other key informants. Our findings reveal how public sector CIOs adopt the role of an ‘institutional entrepreneur’, who demonstrate a series of initiatives augmented through identified behaviours. These relate to proactive community mobilisation (leadership, member focus) and legitimisation (discourse, success stories). We outline the policy implications of DEG and the risk factors of senior managers who enact these processes towards complex technological change. Furthermore, the characterisation of institutional entrepreneurial enactment appears to be extremely beneficial to the transformation to DEG within any contemporary public sector context.}

However, existing conceptual and empirical studies reveal that not all entrepreneurial intentions are ultimately translated into actual behaviour, resulting in an intention-behaviour gap. The current study reviewed the existing literature pertaining to this gap and found that most of the research has examined the contingent role of individual/psychological factors, yet how environmental factors, especially the institutional proximal circles, bridge the intention–behaviour link remains scarce. By employing questionnaire data (n = 1820) collected from university students in China, this research examines the effectiveness of university entrepreneurial offerings on student entrepreneurial intention realisation. The results illustrate that, although a high engagement level in university entrepreneurship education and venture creation contexts accelerates student entrepreneurs’ intention–behaviour translation, the positive effect of instrumental offerings (start-up support services) is stronger than that of entrepreneurship education offerings (entrepreneurial courses and extra-curricular activities). This research extends the application of the theory of planned behaviour to the start-up process by highlighting the entrepreneurship education and venture creation factors derived from the university milieu students are exposed to in accelerating the conversion from entrepreneurial intention to nascent start-up behaviour. It captures the association amidst the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education in aspiring student entrepreneurs’ entrepreneurial learning, intention actualisation, and tangible start-up activities. These findings also draw researchers’ attention to explore further the nuances of various entrepreneurial offerings in student venture creation and how to build an effective university entrepreneurial ecosystem.}

To provide a comprehensive systematic review of entrepreneurship in the context of emerging markets (EMs). The area of research is topical considering the rise of EMs on the global scene and the importance of entrepreneurship in the development of EMs.
Design/methodology/approach
The paper utilizes scientometrics to provide a systematic review of the emerging field of entrepreneurship in EMs (EEMs). The entire Web of Science database was searched, and 2,568 scholarly outputs were extracted and analyzed as a result. The review further compares the EEMs research to the mainstream entrepreneurship research based on the top trending and high impact themes, demonstrates which countries published and are studied in the EEMs scholarship, and finally, it provides a proportion of empirical research done on EEMs to highlight methods utilized in the existing research.
Findings
The scientometric review reveals three broad domains of the EEMs scholarship–(1) Entrepreneurship in EMs and its implications; (2) MNEs, institutional environments, and FDI; and (3) Strategy, innovation and performance. The findings demonstrate that EEMs' scholarship primarily discusses environments within which EEMs takes place, the implications of EEMs, strategy and performance of EEMs (macro and meso-levels), thus highlighting the need for micro-level (individual-based) analysis of EEMs. Approximately, a third of the EEMs research is of empirical nature, more should be done especially in quantitative studies to develop this field further.
Originality/value
This research is unique in providing the largest review of EEMs scholarship. It divides the entire scholarship into three inter-related research streams and identifies future research directions in this immensely important field of research.}

Several of the PPI implementation challenges reported in prior research originate in the institutional architecture underpinning demand articulation, and innovation procurement and adoption processes. We conceptualise innovation intermediaries as institutional entrepreneurs who seek to create new institutions or adjust existing ones to support PPI implementation. We report the results of two case studies of intermediaries facilitating PPI in the UK defence and health sectors, respectively. We contribute to PPI intermediation literature by showing that intermediaries address prevalent institutional failures through four types of institutional entrepreneurship activities: boundary spanning; advocacy; design of change; and capacity building. We elucidate, in particular, the role of individuals within intermediaries, as agents who learn about failures and adapt their institutional work over time. In doing so, these managers go beyond the remit and goals of the organisations they represent. The findings add to our understanding of how intermediaries support demand articulation for PPI by showing that their institutional work is also aimed at designing generic methods and processes to improve what is asked for, and how. We furthermore reveal conditions influencing the effectiveness of intermediaries' efforts to realise institutional change, thereby extending research on institutional entrepreneurship in PPI settings.}

The authors employ an in-depth qualitative approach to understand entrepreneurs’ perspective as being part of an entrepreneurial family. A total of 36 semi-structured interviews were conducted with multiple respondents of each entrepreneurial family.
Findings
This study shows that social capital allows members in the entrepreneurial family to access a wider pool of resources to utilise to benefit their ventures, while also helping them to operate in a challenging institutional environment. It also illustrates how social capital is used to overcome institutional asymmetries.

Design/methodology/approach
A systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies published between 2015 and 2024 was conducted using the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). The analysis followed Braun and Clarke’s (2006) six steps of thematic analysis. A total of 16 articles were analyzed.
Findings
This study found that national quality assurance systems played a pivotal role in promoting dual accreditation through internationalization by establishing standards, providing guidance and incentivizing institutions to meet national and global benchmarks. HEIs have been motivated to pursue dual accreditation by various factors, including enhanced reputation, internationalization, financial stability, quality assurance, policy compliance, benchmarking and graduate employability. However, the dual accreditation process has often been characterized by administrative burdens, differences in standards, language barriers, lack of transparency and institutional misalignment. While these challenges have persisted, HEIs have developed strategies to address them, such as effective planning, resource management, communication, collaboration, knowledge sharing and a tailored approach.

The university-city relationship is also encouraged for the benefit of the city, as universities unleash their respective cities’ potentials to act as driving forces not only for their local communities, but also for the whole nation. Therefore, maintaining a mutual relationship between the university and the city is considered essential to accomplish strategic goals for both. However, the nature of this relationship is quite complex, overlapped, interconnected, and diverse. Therefore, this paper conducted a systematic review of the literature on university-city and campus-city relationships to evaluate recent research trends to uncover the aspects that connect universities with their respective cities. The search included articles published in 4 different databases from January 1990 to January 2021. A total number of 50 articles were selected in this review. The findings uncovered different aspects that could help or hinder university-city relationship based on the physical and functional linkage between the campus and the city. Moreover, findings have shown that it is necessary to understand universities according to their contextual differences, as universities have shown different impacts on their respective cities in terms of their sizes and locations. Results have also shown that the impact of the physical connection between the university and the city goes far beyond campus’s accessibility as it deeply affects students’ social life as well. Therefore, decision makers, stakeholders, and university administrators need to co-design campus development process especially in the early stages to maximize the mutual benefits of campus-city relationship. The main conclusions of this paper address several perspectives and lessons for a more sustainable campus-city relationship.}

The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework of experience co-creation that captures the multi-dimensionality of this construct, as well as a research process for defining of the antecedents of experience co-creation.
Design/methodology/approach
The framework of experience co-creation was conceptualized by means of a literature review. Subsequently, this framework was used as the conceptual basis for a qualitative content analysis of 66 empirical papers investigating alternative consumption models (ACMs), such as renting, remanufacturing, and second-hand models.
Findings
The qualitative content analysis resulted in 12 categories related to the consumer and 9 related to the ACM offerings that represent the antecedents of experience co-creation. These categories provide evidence that, to a large extent, the developed conceptual framework allows one to capture the multi-dimensionality of the experience co-creation construct.
Research limitations/implications
This study underscores the understanding of experience co-creation as a function of the characteristics of the offering – which are, in turn, a function of the consumers’ motives as determined by their lifeworlds – as well as to service design as an iterative approach to finding, creating and refining service offerings.
Practical implications
The investigation of the antecedents of experience co-creation can enable service providers to determine significant consumer market conditions for forecasting the suitability and viability of their offerings and to adjust their service designs accordingly.
Originality/value
This paper provides a step toward the operationalization of the dimension-related experience co-creation construct and presents an approach to defining the antecedents of experience co-creation by considering different research perspectives that can enhance service design research.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine the attributes of the Igbos in Eastern Nigeria and the underlying factors influencing their entrepreneurial behaviour. More specifically, the study highlights the links between family, culture, institution and entrepreneurial behaviour in the African context.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper is based on a qualitative research method by interviewing 50 entrepreneurs and community leaders of the Igbo nation. Igbos have been described as “naturally enterprising and ingenious” and can be found throughout Nigeria and West Africa. Understanding the vagaries of ethnic entrepreneurship can arguably only be achieved through research that is undertaken within these socio-historically rich, traditional and cultural contexts.
Findings
Linked to the social learning theory, Igbo families provide an entrepreneurial leadership platform which influences youths through role models, providing mastery experiences and socialisation. The extended family provides a safe environment for risk taking, creativity and innovation. Also, an informal apprenticeship system provides entrepreneurial learning that prepares the younger generation to take to business as a way of life.
Research limitations/implications
The study is based on a relatively small sample size of 50 respondents, which makes it difficult to generalise the findings despite the benefits of the research methods adopted in the study. Also, there are limitations to the extension of the findings to a generalised Igbo population comprising individuals who may, or may not, behave entrepreneurially.
Practical implications
There are significant practical implications, both nationally and internationally, for policy makers that are concerned with developing jobs for the growing population of unemployed youths and inclusive entrepreneurship in Nigeria.
Originality/value
The research has three main contributions. First, it valorises indigenous knowledge of family and institutional entrepreneurial behaviour in an African context. Second, it highlights the importance of the linked institutions of the extended family and the informal apprenticeship system in Igbo culture. Finally, it provides a model and an explanation of how the Igbo culture nurtures and develops transgenerational entrepreneurial behaviour.}

Data collection included 65 semi-structured interviews with policymakers, managers and providers and analysis of key policy documents. The institutional entrepreneur theory provided the theoretical lens and informed a reflexive iterative data analysis.
Findings
While each case faced unique challenges, there were similarities and differences in how managers enhanced a partnership’s institutional logic. In both cases, entrepreneurial healthcare managers created new roles, negotiated mutually beneficial agreements and co-located staff to foster inter-organisational partnerships between public, private and community organisations in the continuum of care for older adults. In addition, managers in Ontario secured additional funding, while managers in Quebec organised biannual meetings and joint training to enhance inter-organisational partnerships.
Originality/value
This study has two main implications. First, efforts to enhance inter-organisational partnerships should strategically include institutional entrepreneurs. Second, successful institutional changes may be supported by investing in integrated implementation strategies that target roles of staff, co-location and inter-organisational agreements.}

abstract = {With the shift from the industrial era to the digital era and the increasing importance of digital transformation (DT) in organizations, a new role in the top management team of organizations emerged, that of the chief digital officer (CDO). This emerging phenomenon relates to a Chief (C) - level executive position, focused on the development and implementation of the digital strategy in organizations. To provide a better understanding of the nature of this phenomenon, as well as to develop the basis from which scholars to be based on for further developing this research stream, we conduct a systematic review of 29 articles published in highly esteemed business journals. By synthesizing the review findings, we identified emerging themes and core areas of inquiry, and clarified the nature, typologies and role of CDOs in organizations. Moreover, based on the synthesis and gaps identified in this review, as well as via the transfer of theory from the CEO-TMT literature, several research propositions are developed for scholars to test in the future and a new concept is emerged, that of the Multifunctional CDO Leadership. In conclusion this study provides various implications to both research and management practice.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study is to analyze reported good institutional responsible research and innovation (RRI) practices from an organizational and learning perspective to discuss the usefulness of RRI as a broad umbrella concept.
Design/methodology/approach
This study connects neo-institutional and translation accounts of diffusion to different modes of learning and discusses reported best practices from 12 reports, including in total 23 organizations in the research system worldwide, in light of this theoretical framework. This study categorizes the good practices identified in the reports and discusses how the nature of the practices influences the potential learning from them. The authors then apply the results from the discussion of this study to current policy developments on RRI.
Findings
The two most often mentioned good practices overall are organizational policies and the establishment of organizational units, but the type of good practices recommended differs across the various aspects of the RRI umbrella concept. This diversity within the RRI construct is a practical argument against the effectiveness of RRI as an umbrella concept.
Originality/value
This study is novel in the fact that the authors, building on Wæraas (2020), systematically relate types of good practice to neo-institutional theory and translation perspectives explicitly combined with learning approaches and apply this approach in the field of research organizations. The policy implications from the empirical and theoretical analyses are novel and timely in these early phases of the EU funding framework programme Horizon Europe and can also be relevant for the increasingly important umbrella concept of Open Science.}

However, such logic might be understood as a dominant regime that leads to unsustainable systems. We intend to contribute to transitions research by focusing on the agency of social enterprises as non-dominant actors searching for challenging and transforming the institutionalized logics in the business system. Therefore, we disentangle the institutional mechanisms driven by social enterprises by proposing a theoretical model built upon a literature review of sustainability transitions from institutional perspectives, offering a set of explanatory propositions to allow empirical examination. Those mechanisms and propositions operate at three levels: inside the individual, inside the niche, and at the interplay between the niche and the business regime. Finally, we include a real-world example of a social enterprise to illustrate the model.}

It combines discussions from several research projects as well as previous publications to present the scope of commercial choices within open source software and their consequences.
Findings
– The findings show that higher levels of involvement in open source software communities poses important questions about the balance between economic, technological, and social logics as well as the benefits of being autonomous, having access to collaborative networks and minimizing risks related to free-riding. There are six levels of commercial involvement in open source communities, and each of them is characterized by a different dilemma.
Originality/value
– The paper sheds light on the various level of involvement of business in open source movement and emphasize that the popularized “open innovation” concept is only the first step in real involvement and paradigm shift.}

Such policy aims at system-wide transformation and is often referred to as system innovation policy. While insights from transition studies have provided novel and useful rationales for innovation policy targeting system-wide transformation, it remains unclear how to design, implement and evaluate such policies. The contribution of this paper is to translate and concretize the challenges of system innovation policy towards scope for policy action and analysis. Building on insights from transition studies we group the challenges into four domains: directionality, experimentation, demand articulation, and policy coordination and learning. We relate challenges within the four domains to three generic features of innovation systems: interests and capabilities of actors, networks, and institutions. The derived framework is applied in a case study on the strategic innovation programmes, a recent policy initiative by Vinnova, Sweden’s Innovation Agency, targeting system innovation.}

By taking their DSS beyond the published proofs of concept level, they are assuming the role of intrapreneurs. We examine the role and motivations of individual researchers in producing these DSS in relation to the main organizational barriers and opportunities presented by their home institution. The study is based on interviews with researchers, computer engineers, support services staff, and senior-level managers at CIRAD, a French agricultural research for development institute. Our findings reveal that individual motivations are key and often clash with institutional concerns regarding products that fall outside the institution's usual field of expertise. Research institutions should consider carefully the relevance of investing in the development of finalized DSS given the time and effort required from researchers. This study offers a perspective on intrapreneurship processes, highlighting the motivations of researchers to generate impact outside academia and the opportunities and conflicts emerging from the internal realities of research institutions.}

With this, we aim to advance the design of industrial policies towards normative directions such as a circular bio-economy, which requires the creation of market categories as leverage points in industrial sectors considering the micro-dynamic processes of market innovation as well as their structural embeddedness. Using the illustrative case of the German wood-based sector, we depict power relations of industry associations comparing a dyadic and a systemic perspective. Given the resulting differences, we argue that a systemic perspective that considers the structural embeddedness of industry associations’ power relations can better reveal potential innovation dynamics in industrial sectors. Based on systemic power relations, we propose three ideal-types of market structures to categorize markets with different innovation potentials to aid the identification of leverage points for governance interventions in industrial sectors.}

We examine the institutional work underlying a bricolage of crowdsourcing, social media, and data analytics through a longitudinal case study of Cabotagestudien, contributing to research on institutional change, innovation, and technology. Our case analysis reveals three mutually reinforcing forms of institutional work: infrastructure work, crowd work, and data work.

This narrative literature review aims to identify pertinent theories of educational leadership—such as instructional, distributed, and transformational leadership—and explore their potential applications in driving innovation and entrepreneurship within educational settings. The objective is to assess how these leadership approaches can cultivate creativity, encourage risk-taking, and champion entrepreneurship to enhance educational outcomes. This review draws from databases like ‘Taylor and Francis Online,’ ‘ResearchGate,’ ‘Elsevier,’ and search platforms such as ‘Google Scholar’ and ‘ERIC.’ Eight key elements critical for leaders to promote an entrepreneurial culture were identified, including goal-setting, fostering collaboration, and adopting risk-taking approaches. By highlighting these elements, this review addresses the need to reassess leadership theories to align with the evolving demands of modern education, thus offering unique insights into bridging leadership with innovation and entrepreneurship.}

While a growing body of research offers alternative perspectives about markets from the neoclassical perspective, it ignores the degree of embeddedness of the state in markets. In view of this theoretical gap, we investigate the market-shaping activities of states in emerging economies. Our context is the creation of a Korean cultural product market in Vietnam. Based on a document analysis of the nation branding projects of Korea and Vietnam, we investigate how these states are involved in shaping Vietnamese markets for Korean cultural products through their international and national activities. The findings reveal that whereas the Korean state is mobilizing and building diplomatic ties to promote the Korea’s image in Vietnam through its cultural products, the Vietnamese state profits from these products for its East Asian oriented cultural policy. Three actions are being taken by the Vietnamese state: (1) controlling the distribution of Korean cultural products, (2) framing media producers’ and consumers’ behaviors, and (3) creating a network of collaboration between selected Korean and Vietnamese media producers. Through their nation branding practices, the Vietnamese and Korean states act as institutional entrepreneurs in shaping the Vietnamese market for Korean cultural products.}

This extends the theory of institutional entrepreneurship by demonstrating how regulatory frameworks can incentivize corporate actors to adopt sustainable practices. It highlights the critical role of regulatory environments in shaping institutional entrepreneurship, suggesting that stringent regulations can effectively drive organizations toward sustainability. This perceived normative and cognitive pressure aligns with Levy and Kolk (2002), which suggests that climate strategies are formulated by managers from countries where such environmental practices are strictly required (Pinkse, 2007). Compared with previous studies, this paper reveals that collective institutional entrepreneurship can create opportunities for integrating sustainability policies under favorable conditions. Unlike Jolly et al. (2016), who highlighted the isolated and contested actions of individual actors, this study shows that sustainability policies and developments by legacy aviation groups often overlap at both micro (individual) and meso (organizational or institutional) levels. This intersection of corporate values with individual passengers, other subsidiary airlines and international community expectations underscores a collective institutional entrepreneurship that fosters integrated sustainability policies under favorable conditions.}
