T1  - International technology transfer to Africa in light of the SDGs: What do we know about the barriers?
AN  - 3054953768
AB  - International technology transfer (ITT) is commonly seen as an essential way to bridge the gap between highly advanced industrialised nations and developing countries. This gap is particularly pronounced with a view of African states. These generally have a limited capacity to cope with the effects of climate change. Therefore, foreign innovations must be successfully adopted to realities on the continent to mitigate the effects. This has sparked a growing academic interest in this topic in recent years, leading to many aspects being covered in the literature. This paper takes stock of the current state of the art, thereby asking the question: What do we know about the problems regarding international technology transfer to Africa? Employing a reproducible, transparent and clear systematic review, 73 relevant texts are identified. The barriers to more (successful) international technology transfer that these publications identify are discussed. As this review clarifies, many aspects are known, but specifics around governance aspects and institutional set‐ups are primarily bypassed in the discussion.

T1  - Mitigating the socioeconomic impacts of the mining industry through Social Technologies: Guidelines for technology transfer between universities and communities
AN  - 2908282488
AB  - The mineral sector causes socioeconomic and environmental impacts on the surrounding communities. Thus, Social Technologies (STs) developed by universities are an alternative for improving the quality of life of the people affected by mining activities. STs are a Latin American practice comprising solutions for social inclusion and economic development. Thus, this article critically investigates the impacts of mining and STs, reinforcing the potential applications of STs in this field. Additionally, the work discusses the possibilities of technology transfer from the university to society through a comprehensive literature review, and the authors developed guidelines to mitigate the impacts of mining activities using STs implementation with technology transfer as a tool. The literature review showed that, although multiple STs aim at social inclusion, the success of the ST depends on the socio‐technical suitability of each community, an efficient training process, and the capacity for self‐management by the social actors. The guideline created includes aspects of: approach and scenario reconstruction, mapping, identification of vocations, training, and technical support for affected communities. Additionally, the mining sector can use these guidelines as a Corporate Social Responsibility tool.

T1  - Science‐based innovation via university spin‐offs: the influence of intangible assets
AN  - 2896047289
AB  - University spin‐offs (USOs) have attracted significant attention from scholars and policymakers as an important mechanism for science‐based innovation. The debate on how USOs generate innovation outcomes has often focused on tangible assets, while the role of intangible assets has been less explored and remains loosely defined. Yet emerging research suggests that intangible assets, especially in the early stages of a USO's lifecycle, have a critical influence on its survival and future success, highlighting a need for a better understanding of how intangible assets enable science‐based innovation through USOs. Drawing from several streams of literature, we define intangible assets in the context of science‐based innovation through USOs: an intangible asset is a resource that is non‐physical, non‐financial, has long life, and has potential to provide future benefits to the owner. Based on this working definition, we conduct a systematic literature review of the leading innovation management journals and inductively derive a framework outlining the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of science‐based innovation through USOs, focusing on the influence of intangible assets. The framework identifies the categories of resources which can enhance or hinder science‐based innovation through USOs. Such categorization reveals fruitful directions for future research such as a deeper examination of societal outcomes. We conclude by offering recommendations for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to better leverage intangible assets to enhance science‐based innovation.

T1  - Evidence in management science related to psychology: benefits, tools, and an example of a community-augmented meta-analysis
AN  - 2860749079
AB  - In the field of evidence-based management, the academic-practice gap is well-known and undermines the transfer of scientific findings to evidence-based decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the practical approach of community augmented meta-analysis (CAMA) that serves to ease cumulative evidence formation and dissemination in psychology. CAMA rests on the conviction that a better and faster knowledge transfer requires an increase in the efficiency and quality of evidence integration, timely publication of results, and a broad and easy accessibility. As a potential solution, we describe the platform PsychOpen CAMA that enables the publication of and access to meta-analytic data. We conclude with an empirical example that describes the implementation and presentation of a meta-analysis on gender differences in the intention to start a business using PsychOpen CAMA. Finally, we discuss benefits and potentials of the publication of meta-analytic data on the platform, as well as current methodological and technical limitations.

T1  - Exploring the Role of U.K. Government Policy in Developing the University Entrepreneurial Finance Ecosystem for Cleantech
AN  - 2775103446
AB  - Vast sums of public money are invested into universities globally as anchor institutions and knowledge bases providing seedbed resources for research and development and entrepreneurship. Focusing on university science and technology research we examine two U.K. case studies of government support from the “Innovation Knowledge Centre” (IKC) program to translate research into industry innovation for public good. Although IKCs are not tasked to address climate change, the two case studies demonstrate tremendous potential for Cleantech development. An exploratory entrepreneurial finance (“entfin”) ecosystem theoretical lens contextualizes the catalytic roles of universities and public funding to support industry at the base of the innovation finance escalator. We thus develop university-industry ecosystems literature, addressing the gap in nurturing university entfin for climate change. Our qualitative case study methodology includes literature review and 51 key informant interviews with: policymakers; university research leaders, technology transfer officers, specialist research to industry innovation “translation” staff, SME beneficiaries, trade bodies; and early-stage private finance providers. We reveal nuances in different emerging innovation sectors—notably their degree of maturity, locality, and outcome horizons for achieving impact, drawing attention to the key roles of universities and financing and their interactions within their entfin ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for government long horizon, deep pocket, investment, and integrated university entfin policy mix, alongside more open, inclusive, ecosystem development between different actors.

T1  - Evidence‐Informed Audit Standard Setting: Exploring Evidence Use and Knowledge Transfer
AN  - 2749318484
AB  - Academics and practitioners agree that there are substantial barriers to systematically transferring audit research knowledge to policy‐makers. We adopt a design science approach to investigate the efficacy of employing a research synthesis, embedded in an interactive process with audit standard setters, to transfer such knowledge. We identify a standard‐setting issue that, we argue, is typical of the class of problems encountered by both parties when attempting knowledge transfer. Following design science prescriptions, we evaluate the pragmatic validity of our prototype research synthesis and its creation process. We provide initial evidence (“proof of concept”) that a research synthesis process can effectively and efficiently facilitate academic research knowledge transfer to inform audit standard setters' deliberations. Finally, we provide evidence that the problem of academic research knowledge transfer in accounting standard setting and evaluation continues. Our study and findings reflect how design science facilitates change in real‐world problem contexts through research‐based proofs of concept.Alternate abstract:RÉSUMÉÉlaboration de normes d'audit fondées sur des données probantes : exploration de l'utilisation des données et du transfert de connaissancesLes chercheurs et les praticiens reconnaissent qu'il existe des obstacles importants au transfert systématique des connaissances issues de la recherche en audit auprès des décideurs. Les auteurs de la présente étude adoptent une approche de science de la conception pour étudier l'efficacité de l'utilisation d'une synthèse de recherche, intégrée dans un processus interactif avec les normalisateurs d'audit, pour transférer ces connaissances. Ils identifient un problème de normalisation qui, selon eux, est typique pour la catégorie de problèmes rencontrés par les deux parties lorsqu'elles tentent de transférer des connaissances. En s'appuyant sur la science de la conception, les auteurs évaluent la validité pragmatique de leur prototype de synthèse de recherche et de son processus de création. Ils fournissent des données initiales (« preuve de concept ») indiquant qu'un processus de synthèse de recherche peut, de façon efficace et efficiente, faciliter le transfert de connaissances issues de la recherche universitaire afin d'éclairer les réflexions des normalisateurs d'audit. Enfin, ils fournissent des données montrant que le problème lié au transfert des connaissances issues de la recherche universitaire persiste dans le domaine de l'élaboration et de l'évaluation des normes comptables. Cette étude et les résultats qui en découlent reflètent la manière dont la science de la conception facilite le changement dans les contextes de problèmes réels grâce à des preuves de concept basées sur la recherche.

T1  - FIRM SIZE, RADICAL AND INCREMENTAL INNOVATION: A META-ANALYSIS BASED ON THE AWARENESS-MOTIVATION-CAPABILITY PERSPECTIVE
AN  - 2742901624
AB  - This study investigates the firm size-innovation puzzle through distinguishing radical from incremental innovation, and examining the country-level context (i.e., university–industry collaboration in R&D and competition intensity) that the firm size-innovation relationship is contingent on. The meta-analysis including 162 studies with 112,639 firms reveals that firm size can simultaneously benefit for radical and incremental innovations, while the measurement of firm size using the non-personnel indices can result in significant difference between the firm size-radical innovation and firm size-incremental innovation. Additionally, it is found that the positive relationship between firm size and radical innovation increases when university–industry collaboration in R&D and competition intensity is stronger. This study quantitatively summarises the relationship between firm size and radical/incremental innovation and updates the correlations reported in established literatures. Drawing on awareness-motivation-capability perspective, it takes an essential and frontier step in testing the country-level context that can influence the effect of firm size on innovation.

T1  - THE IMPORTANCE OF ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY IN TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND ORGANISATIONAL PERFORMANCE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
AN  - 2696360030
AB  - Over the years, the literature on management has advanced in the understanding of the relationship between technology transfer, absorptive capacity and organisational performance. Nevertheless, to date, the number of studies investigating these relationships in a joint manner, showing how the result varies in different contexts, is still rare. This systematic literature review analyses the existing academic literature on the relationship between technology transfer, absorptive capacity and organisational performance by carrying out a bibliometric and qualitative analysis of the literature. The bibliometric analysis provided an overview of the literature, identifying the most prominent and influent journals, countries, institutions, authors and research methods, as well as intersections between the constructs and the temporal evolution of the publications. The qualitative analysis was employed in order to understand, systematise and assess the previous findings on the subjects. The results showed that absorptive capacity is an important factor for effective technology transfer, when taking into account international technology transfer, university-industry collaboration and inter-organisational transfer. The literature converges in indicating that both technology transfer and absorptive capacity have a positive impact on organisational performance, although some existing exceptions need to be considered. Finally, the study provides an agenda for future research based on contextual, methodological and theoretical gaps identified.

T1  - Examining knowledge transfer and networks: an overview of the last twenty years
AN  - 2708940475
AB  - Purpose>Knowledge transfer (KT) has been attracting significant attention from the scientific community. The need to establish collaborative network relationships to achieve effective KT has led to a large volume of studies that attempt to identify how collaborative networks influence KT processes. However, papers, which link KT and networks have not been systematised. This study aims to provide an overview of this academic field and sets an agenda for future research.Design/methodology/approach>The authors followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses method to conduct a systematic review of the literature published in 2000–2020. The authors sourced the sample from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The authors screened the references under the management and business categories that were published in the first two quartiles of the Journal Citation Report. This search returned 190 impactful papers across the 53 journals that were analysed.Findings>The authors present the main results in two sections. First, this paper elaborates a conceptual model of the field; second, the authors review KT between firms and other agents, which allows us to identify KT flows within and between companies, universities and public institutions.Originality/value>This paper provides the first systematic review of collaborative networks and KT. Five areas of action are identified for future research and are specified in several research questions. The authors also provide several practical implications. In a world in which more and more dynamic agents coexist, it is important to be aware of the needs of organisations that create and disseminate specific knowledge.

T1  - Worldwide Research on Open Innovation in SMEs
AN  - 2642459441
AB  - Research on open innovation (OI) has increased in recent years, showing its potential in various areas of knowledge. Its relation to small and medium-sized enterprises has attracted the attention of academics. This article aims to evaluate the intellectual structure of the scientific study of OI, and its close relationship with various scientific fields, through a bibliometric analysis of this academic field using the Scopus database and the application of the VOSviewer software. The methodology comprises a rigorous systematic and transparent process divided into four phases: (i) the establishment of search criteria for the research field, through a literature review for its selection; (ii) the selection of the database, the establishment of the search equation and extraction of information; (iii) the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selected documents and an explanation of the usefulness of the software; and (iv) the analysis of the results through the approaches of scientific output performance and bibliometric mapping. The results show an increasing trend of IO publications in SMEs, consolidated in 396 articles with contributions from 65 countries and 947 authors. The intellectual structure shows seven themes related to firm performance, R&D networks, business management, business models, capabilities and knowledge transfer. This study contributes to the field by providing an overview of IO in SME contexts. It also provides insightful information to policymakers for developing policies for firm economic growth.

T1  - More than meets the partner: a systematic review and agenda for University–Industry cooperation
AN  - 2622622837
AB  - The literature on university–industry relations suggests the need for greater clarification and deeper systematization of the University–Industry cooperation process. This study aims, using a systematic review of the literature to deepen the University–Industry state of the art and identify the main research trends. ISI's Web of Science was the database used, and a Bibliographic Coupling bibliometric analysis was performed. Based on the outcomes of the literature review, we could identify four clusters: (1) motivations and barriers to cooperation, (2) determinant factors, (3) government measures, and (4) Intersector technological cooperation. This article reveals that industries are willing and motivated to engage in cooperation agreements with universities due to knowledge and technology transfer, however, some barriers will have to be overcome. Based on the existing literature, an agenda for further research was laid out.

T1  - A bibliometric review of the technology transfer literature
AN  - 2574928983
AB  - This study explores academic research on technology transfer (TT) and the related themes. The TT field has attracted considerable scholarly attention in recent years and has grown rapidly, resulting in a large body of knowledge. Using a bibliometric approach, this study reviews related research issues as well as their influence and connections and provides directions for future research. It uses Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science database that includes 3218 bibliographic references. Several bibliometric analysis techniques and a subsequent review of the content of the most relevant documents are adopted. The performance analysis provided an updated overview of the evolution of the TT literature from 1969 to 2018 and quantitatively identified the most active and influential journals, articles, authors, and organizations. The co-authorship network analysis allowed us to identify and visualize the structure of relations between authors as well as determine the collaboration patterns among them. On the basis of the information supplied by the co-authorship network, the main literature was reviewed to identify the current status and research trends related to TT, identifying five main research streams and related topics. The implications of the study’s findings and directions for future TT research are finally discussed to enhance our understanding of TT agents and issues and support further research in this field.

T1  - Reimagining community relationships for organizational learning: a scoping review with implications for a learning health system
AN  - 2553296623
AB  - Background 
Communities represent a highly relevant source of knowledge with regard to not only healthcare performance but also sociocultural context, yet their role in learning health systems has not been studied. Situating the learning health system as an organization, this paper explores the phenomenon of organizational learning from or with communities (defined as one of ‘the people,’ such as a town, a specific patient group or another group directly receiving a healthcare service).
 Methods 
We conducted a scoping review to determine what is known about organizational learning from or with communities that the organization serves, and to contribute to a more comprehensive evidence base for building and operating learning health systems. In March 2019, we systematically searched six academic databases and grey literature, applying no date limits, for English language materials that described organizational learning in relation to knowledge transfer between an organization and a community. Numerous variables were charted in Excel and synthesized using frequencies and thematic analysis. We updated this search in August 2020.
 Results 
In total, 42 documents were included in our analysis. We found a disproportionate emphasis on learning explicit knowledge from community rather than on tacit knowledge or learning in equal partnership with community. Our review also revealed inconsistently defined concepts, tenuously linked with their theoretical and empirical foundations. Our findings provide insight to understand the organization-community learning relationship, including motives and power differentials; types of knowledge to be learned; structures and processes for learning; and transformative learning outcomes.
 Conclusions 
Our review makes a singular contribution to organizational learning literatures by drawing from diverse research disciplines such as health services, business and education to map what is known about learning from or with community. Broadly speaking, learning health systems literature would benefit from additional research and theory-building within a sociological paradigm so as to establish key concepts and associations to understand the nature of learning with community, as well as the practices that make it happen.

T1  - Why Most University-Industry Partnerships Fail to Endure and How to Create Value and Gain Competitive Advantage through Collaboration – A Systematic Review
AN  - 2438358287
AB  - Purpose: The collaborative work between universities and enterprises is increasingly important given the growing competitive environment, transformed by intense global competition, rapid technological change and shorter product life cycles. In this article several case studies are analysed, as well as relevant academic literature, to get an insight concerning the current relationship status between enterprises and universities.
Methodology/Approach: The methodology is grounded on the literature review on University-Industry Partnerships, selected from indexed sources, and targeted to case-based experiences where practical feedback is given.
Findings: It is shown that university-industry knowledge transfer contributes significantly to an increase of quality, productivity and economic value of businesses. It is found that the lack of controlling mechanisms and lack of efficient communication paths have a strong negative impact in collaboration. Key collaboration factors that support stronger relationships were compiled and discussed in support of better mitigation strategies.
Research Limitation/implication: The limited availability of case studies reporting on operative improvements introduced by policy changes hinders the effectiveness of the findings.
Originality/Value of paper: The paper analyses the collaboration of the university with industry based on case studies with a focus on value creation and how to gain a competitive advantage through collaboration.

T1  - International faculty, knowledge transfer, and innovation in higher education: A human resource development perspective
AN  - 2302407537
AB  - In the field of international human resource management, a widely held assumption identifies expatriation as a completely enriching experience which provides employees with knowledge of high value and contributes to enhancing general management capacity [24]. This research investigates the effect of expatriation on knowledge transfer as a driver for innovation and performance. The study uses the case of international faculty in a higher education institution to shed light on the interplay between sharing international experiences, facilitating knowledge transfer, and generating value. Following a thorough literature review, research on knowledge transfer processes within the education sector remains limited. We still have little guidance on the mechanisms enabling knowledge transfer inside universities, particularly when promoting faculty mobility or hiring international faculty and researchers. This research adopts a single case study method while using Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, an international higher education institution, as a context of investigation. The study involved international faculty from the schools of engineering, business, and humanities and also Moroccan faculty who received their education abroad to explore the processes of experience and knowledge sharing among diverse workforce and how such processes could lead to creating a space for knowledge transfer that enables in turn better innovation and performance. The findings of this research show the limited knowledge transfer dynamics inside internationally-oriented higher education institutions and demonstrate the importance of adopting human resource development practices as facilitating mechanisms to support knowledge transfer while involving and benefitting various stakeholders. The study suggests different developmental venues for universities to support knowledge transfer from international faculty including teamwork, training and faculty orientation, collaborative research projects, resources and incentives, and industry-oriented educational and consulting programs. This research has the potential to lay the foundations of a theoretical framework integrating knowledge transfer and value generation dynamics within the context of higher education.

T1  - Re-thinking university spin-off: a critical literature review and a research agenda
AN  - 1981999523
AB  - In recent years, universities have focused more on the creation of spin-off companies as a means of transferring the knowledge generated by their research activities. At the same time, this has generated an increase in academic research on this business structure in order to identify the best strategies for their management and the most efficient university policies, amongst other things. In this study, we have identified and evaluated the literature on university spin-offs published in journals included in the Social Sciences Citation Index of the Web of Science in order to identify what, by whom, where and how it has been researched. The number of studies was marginal until 2000 but has grown exponentially since 2010. Our systematic review classifies research findings into three levels—individual, firm, and institutional context—each with respect to characteristics, antecedents, and outcomes of entrepreneurial activities. Reviewing the content of these articles allows some gaps in the research to be identified and conclusions to be reached about possible future research in this field to supplement, update and extend the results obtained to date.

T1  - A systematic literature review of university technology transfer from a quadruple helix perspective: toward a research agenda
AN  - 1980826834
AB  - Within recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of the University's role in economic development. This has resulted in University Technology Transfer (UTT) taking place within an increasingly complex network of regional stakeholders. This complexity has resulted in quadruple helix models where the triple helix model of academia, industry and regional government now includes societal based innovation users as a fourth helix. Despite this development, extant research is fragmented and lacks coherent frameworks and conceptualisations which fully depict the dynamic and evolving nature of UTT. Accordingly, this article reviews Mode 2 UTT from a quadruple helix perspective to identify key themes to develop a research agenda which reflects progression from a triple into a quadruple helix ecosystem.

T1  - Researchers' willingness to engage in knowledge and technology transfer activities: an exploration of the underlying motivations
AN  - 1952394575
AB  - Increasingly, universities have become conscious of their important role as centres of knowledge generation and diffusion. Accordingly, they have put in place policies, methods and resources to increase knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) activities. However, succeeding in this endeavour is not that easy. An active involvement of researchers is fundamental. Literature examining researchers' attitude towards KTT activities is limited, offering a partial view on the subject. This study aims at bringing new light to this issue. First, we identify those factors that influence researchers' willingness to engage in KTT activities. From a comprehensive literature review, we distinguish between intrinsic motivations, extrinsic motivations and university support and services as critical elements. A scale is developed and validated. Second, the scale is applied to the case of R&D contracts. The sample consists of 249 researchers from one of the biggest Spanish universities. Results suggest that the proposed scale has a good fit, indicating that it can be considered as a good instrument for measuring researchers' willingness to get involved in KTT activities. Policy implications and directions for future research are provided.

T1  - PP166 From An Institutional Strategic Plan To A Knowledge Transfer Tool For Health Technology Assessment: Case Of Drug-eluting Stents
AN  - 1986598066
AB  - INTRODUCTION:Knowledge transfer (KT) of Health Technolgy Assessment (HTA) results presents numerous challenges, one being the lack of time of busy decision makers. Our hospital-based HTA unit is now part of a large network comprising 100 installations. To bridge the gap between complex HTAs and even more limited time by executive officers and managers, we needed to develop a new approach to deliver effectively key HTA messages. We initiated a new strategy with a report on drug-eluting stent (DES). DES may have the potential to eradicate restenosis and the necessity to perform multiple revascularization procedures subsequent to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the technology is expensive and some concerns about safety remain. The second generation of DES stents show promising results in terms of efficacy and safety.METHODS:We conducted a systematic review of meta-analyses comparing bare-metal stents (BMS) with second generation DES. Data extracted were used to perform a cost-benefit analysis for our organization. Main findings were illustrated in relation to the strategic plan of our institution.RESULTS:As compared to BMS, the second generation of DES is very effective and potentially leads to huge savings. Safety is improved as regard to myocardial infarction, but not to mortality. For our institution, the use of second-generation DES has the potential to reduce waiting lists for a PCI. In an effort to improve clarity of the results and increase knowledge transfer among managers, we developed a new communication strategy involving the six axes considered as strategic by our Chief Executive Officer, namely: university mission, judicious use of resources, accessibility and quality of care and services, to build for and with the staff, and to act for and with the patient and his family. This led to a smart visual scheme directly showing the results in terms of what is important for our hospital. This initiative was very appreciated by managers.CONCLUSIONS:Using our institutional strategic plan to communicate our results allowed a greater visibility of HTA activities and was greatly appreciated by managers. This will help in disseminating our results locally and in promoting the utility of HTA.

T1  - Reverse Knowledge Transfer in Multinational Companies: A Systematic Literature Review
AN  - 1890206593
AB  - The mainstream literature has focused on knowledge transfers from parent companies to subsidiaries, while paying less attention to knowledge created at the subsidiary level. But there is a growing trend to knowledge co-creation, and the responsibility of knowledge creation has shifted from headquarters to the corporation as a whole and its subsidiaries. Using a thorough systematic review over a 15-year period in top-tier journals, this thematic analysis finds interesting literature gaps to be filled and proposes a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the reverse knowledge transfer as a complex process; moreover, we offer a detailed view on the phenomenon of reverse knowledge transfer, seeking to contribute to a better understanding of it and providing a basis to assist corporate managers in global strategic planning and knowledge management and scholars in future academic research in the field.

T1  - University Knowledge Transfer Offices and Social Responsibility
AN  - 1858321351
AB  - Numerous studies and reviews about University Knowledge Transfer Offices (UKTO) have been written, but there are few that focus on Social Responsibility (SR). We present a systematic review of the research on both fields. We consider not only logics from agency theory and resource-based view, but also the dynamic approach from institutional theory, as they aim to generate sustainable economic and social value. The evolution of Knowledge Transfer Offices depends on their role as brokers of collaborations among different stakeholders, according to their mission and capacity to confront the innovation gap. We follow the line of SR viewed as a response to the specific demands of large stakeholders. Building upon recent conceptualizations of different theories, we develop an integrative model for understanding the institutional effects of the UKTO on university social responsibility.

T1  - Intelligent approaches for an organisation's management system change
AN  - 1808570640
AB  - Purpose              - The purpose of this paper is to contribute learning, knowledge creation and knowledge transfer obtained through a web-based role-play simulation environment as an intelligent approach towards organisational change. Such change occurs in the organisation during its transition to a new version of the ISO 9001:2015.              Design/methodology/approach              - This paper is based on a literature review and the experience of the authors and a team of international teaching and research staff, as well as on information obtained from satisfaction surveys.              Findings              - The actual version of the web-based Management System Role-Play Simulation (MS-RPS©) considers the changes in structure and terminology of the ISO management system standards, enables the creation of a predictive strategy regarding organisational culture, minimises the negative impact of the change and helps people adapt more quickly to it.              Research limitations/implications              - The study is limited to the complexity of an actual system and the possible verification of empirical results. Another limitation is the measurability of any real enhancement achieved in the quality, safety and sustainability of production, as well as the business continuity and social responsibility of an organisation.              Practical implications              - One benefit of the training is the thorough knowledge that players within organisational management can gain in a short period.

T1  - Knowledge Transfer as Translation: Review and Elements of an Instrumental Theory
AN  - 1806557212
AB  - Based on a literature review, this paper investigates the potential of translation theory to energize the study of knowledge transfer between source and recipient organizational units. The central assumption is that translation theory is not only useful for analyzing knowledge-transfer processes, but also has the potential to guide deliberate interventions in such processes. Based on this premise, and drawing on insights from the neighboring academic discipline of translation studies, the author outlines the elements of an instrumental translation theory, with the aim of developing knowledge about how to conduct translations of practices and ideas to achieve various organizational ends in knowledge transfers. The instrumental theory is founded on two main arguments. The first is that knowledge transfers between organizations are rule-based translation processes. The second is that the way in which translators use various translation rules and perform translations may be decisive for outcomes of knowledge-transfer processes. This study develops a typology of three translation modes (the reproducing, the modifying and the radical mode) and four appurtenant translation rules (copying, addition, omission and alteration), and discusses which translation rules fit which conditions. The author identifies three critical conditional variables in knowledge transfers - the translatability of the source practice, the transformability of the transferred knowledge, and the similarity between source and recipient units - and discusses the appropriateness of each translation rule in relation to these variables.

T1  - Colaboración Universidad-Empresa y Desarrollo Regional. El caso de Oruro (Bolivia)
AN  - 1632357941
AB  - This paper explores the factors that determine knowledge and technology transfer (TT) between the university and business in a developing country. The objective is to analyze the impact of these activities on regional development by adopting the open innovation perspective and focusing on the individual. To do this, after a literature review and using qualitative methodology, ten semi-structured interviews with teachers at the Technical University of Oruro (UTO) and managers of small and medium enterprises in the Department of Oruro (Bolivia) were conducted. The main results show that these activities are still very incipient in the region, so their impact on regional development is low. In conclusion, this study establishes that the determinants for TT activities between the UTO and the business sector can be divided into opportunities and barriers. Among the opportunities for the UTO, internal improvements and a more proactive role in society stand out. For the companies, the opportunities are improved productivity and competitiveness. On the other hand, the barriers to TT are bureaucratic, lack of funding, lack of confidence and lack of professionalism. Therefore, it is very important that a clear policy be established to regulate technology transfer activities.

T1  - Knowledge management
AN  - 2083736754
AB  - Purpose – A research study has been undertaken at the University of South Australia to introduce application of lessons learned process in construction contractors' bidding process in the context of knowledge management. The study aims to identify barriers to effectively capture lessons learned in Australian construction industry and how knowledge management can benefit from lessons learned application. Design/methodology/approach – The research study has been undertaken through conducting a “methodological triangulation” and “interdisciplinary triangulation”. This involved an extensive literature review of knowledge management, organisation learning, lessons learned and associated processes and administration of a questionnaire to a sample of construction contractors operating in Australia to elicit opinions on the main barriers to capturing lessons learned, practices such as existence and retention of documentation procedures. A total of 81 useable responses were received from 450 organisations. Response data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics with correlation analysis to examine the strength of relationship among the barriers. Findings – The top-3 barriers to the effective capturing of lessons learned were “lack of employee time”, “lack of resources” and “lack of clear guidelines”, whereas, “lack of management support” was the least ranked barrier. The study established that despite the majority of the ACCs having formal procedures for recording the tenders submitted and their outcomes, only a minority actually retained the lessons learned documentation for each project. The larger contractors were found to be more aware of the importance of lessons learned documentation. A comparative analysis with previous studies also found a disparity in the ranking of the barriers. Research limitations/implications – The majority of the participants were small construction contractors in Australia. The reason is that the researchers were not aware of the contractors' size prior to inviting them for participation in the research study. Second the findings may not generalize to other industries or to organisations operating in other countries. Originality/value – The findings of this survey help ACCs to understand the importance of lessons learned documentation as part of lessons learned implementation and identify the barriers to effectively document their lessons learned. The study provides insights on the barriers and proposes advocated solutions in form of drivers and enablers (critical success factors) of organisational learning capturing among the Australian construction contractors. By reviewing the current literature, “post-project reviews” and “lessons learned” as important elements of organisation learning knowledge transfer, are addressed. Finally, contribution of this study to knowledge and practice has been discussed in this paper.

T1  - Using the Knowledge Transfer Partnership approach in undergraduate education and practice-based training to encourage employer engagement
AN  - 1321561481
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual viewpoint which proposes the use of the post graduate Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) approach to learning in undergraduate education and practice-based training. Design/methodology/approach - This is an examination of the KTP approach and how this could be used effectively in undergraduate education and training to encourage and increase practice-based learning and employer engagement. The methodology consists of a literature review, and a case study of the KTP approach. The literature reviewed examines the KTP approach, employer engagement in education and strategic government approaches to stimulate investment in knowledge and skills for workforce development, and the development of practice-based learning in the UK. The KTP provides a case study to illustrate a successful model of employer engagement, which benefits all parties to it, and assists with the strategic development required by successive governments. Findings - The suggestions are based on the authors' investigation and their understanding and experience of: the KTP approach; practice-based learning; undergraduate education; and learning and teaching approaches. The paper suggests that the KTP approach (normally a post-graduate model) could be extended to undergraduate education to provide sustainable practice-based learning that fits well with the strategies and ideologies of government, employers and academia. Practical implications - Barriers to employer and academic engagement, such as that linked to the confused terminology used to describe practice-based learning, and competing political ideologies, should be researched further to gain a better understanding of how to mitigate these in order to make the KTP approach in undergraduate education successful. The implications are that synergistic development of the KTP approach in an increased range of academic and workplace partnerships needs to be done before a fully tested model could be agreed. Originality/value - The originality is the idea of utilising a well acknowledged post-graduate model of learning within an undergraduate environment. The value is to increase the awareness of the benefits of the KTP and how the approach could be adapted for use in undergraduate environments for the eventual benefit of students, academics, employers and policy makers.

AN  - 1242221553
AB  - Purpose - The paper examines the effects of ICT readiness dimensions on ICT acceptance among Technical, Entrepreneurial and Vocational Training (TEVT) students in the University of Malawi, using correlation and regression analyses. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey was used with a sample of 125 respondents drawn from a population of 296 students pursuing TEVT-related programmes in the University of Malawi. Data were collected using a questionnaire based on Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and Technology Acceptance (TA) models. Findings - The findings show that technology readiness (TR) dimensions affect attitude towards ICT and that gender difference does not play a significant role on TR, attitude towards ICT and the relationship between TR and TA. Further, the findings show that TR dimensions explain only 33 per cent of the variations in TA. Research limitations/implications - Exploring further factors that explain the remaining 67 per cent of variations in attitude towards ICT could be an interesting area for further research. Originality/value - This study contributes towards technology transfer and diffusion discourses in a predominantly associative culture by explaining the extent of the effects of TR dimensions on TA.

T1  - Championship Behaviors and Innovations Success: An Empirical Investigation of University Spin-Offs
AN  - 875738426
AB  - Despite the flurry of scholarly research on champions, no prior article has explicitly addressed how different dimensions of championship behavior actually contribute to innovation success. In this article, based on an extensive literature review, the authors argue that champions display four behaviors, namely pursuing innovative ideas, network building, persisting under adversity, and taking responsibility for the idea. The authors use data from 123 university spin-offs to test proposed linear and curvilinear relationships between the four behaviors and an objective measure of innovation success, namely a longitudinal measure of sales growth. The results indicate that network building has the desired positive relationship with sales performance. Surprisingly, pursuing the innovative idea is not related to sales growth. Furthermore, the present study also reveals some dysfunctional effects of champion behaviors. Persisting under adversity and taking responsibility have the hypothesized inverted-U relationship with sales growth.

T1  - The business school in transition: New opportunities in management development, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation
AN  - 851366319
AB  - This paper aims to consider the extent to which business school transition has created new opportunities in management development, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation.  The paper is a critical review of knowledge exchange in a business school context with a particular focus on the "translation or management practice gap".  Change in the nature of research undertaken in business schools opens up new opportunities for collaboration between academia and practice. The paper points to the need for more innovative forms of research engagement encouraging academic-practitioner collaboration and practice-based management development initiatives.  The paper contributes to the debate on innovative forms of knowledge exchange and transfer and helps stimulate further studies examining potential approaches to fostering co-learning and discovery and participatory forms of knowledge production.  Changes in business school environment and context offer opportunities for new modes of knowledge exchange both in management development and research. Practice based theory offers a new paradigm of management development.  Recent commentators refer to notions of academia and practice as "closed systems and self referential" and point to the requirement for greater attention on knowledge transfer, and to learn from knowledge transfer studies concerning practitioner/research communities of practice, networks and collaborations. The paper addresses this deficiency in the literature and points to key areas warranting further research.

T1  - University IPRs and knowledge transfer: is university ownership more efficient?
AN  - 763038668
AB  - This paper addresses an issue that has been largely ignored so far in the empirical literature on the role of patents in university-industry knowledge transfer: does it matter who owns the patents on university research? We observe that especially in Europe, many patents in which university researchers are listed as inventors are not owned by the university. From a literature review, we conclude that private ownership of university patents may reduce the efficiency of the knowledge transfer process. This hypothesis is put to an empirical test, using data on patents in six European countries. Specifically, we assess whether university-owned patents (in Europe) are more often applied, and/or more economically valuable, than university-invented (but not-owned) patents. Our results indicate that, after correcting for observable patent characteristics, there are only very small differences between university-owned and university-invented patents in terms of their rate of commercialization or economic value.

T1  - University-industry knowledge interaction: case studies from Finland and China
AN  - 762312599
AB  - The paper examines the roles of formal governance and informal social networking in University-Industry (U-I) knowledge interaction in the context of high-tech Multinational Corporations (MNCs). The issue is approached by conducting a critical literature review with empirical cases from Finland and China. Previous studies on U-I collaboration focus primarily on one-way technology and knowledge transfer. This study argues that especially in the cross-cultural context of high-tech MNCs, more interactive types of knowledge interaction should be of key concern where there are various challenges of informal governance that include, for example, interpersonal trust, mutual commitment, frequency of communication and interaction, and awareness of cultural and knowledge-related gaps between collaboration partners.

T1  - Spreading Leader Knowledge: Investigating a Participatory Mode of Knowledge Dissemination among Management Undergraduates
AN  - 207620744
AB  - In this paper we discuss the need for a practitioner-academic partnership in disseminating leader knowledge among undergraduate management students, and find that in order to cultivate actionable skill development, business and academic communities should collaborate to offer a participatory approach to leadership education. The core objective is to discover sources of actionable knowledge and to decipher its optimum dissemination among management students, encompassing technical, conceptual and human skill development, through interaction with both theory and practice, in order to prepare students for active participation, and potential leadership, in the business environment. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we propose a participatory leader knowledge dissemination model, where business leaders can stimulate the academic environment, and leadership skill development can be promoted through practitioners' active involvement in the education process. The article concludes with a perspective on the evolution of knowledge transfer among management students and the current trend towards dynamic collaboration between academics and corporate leaders.
