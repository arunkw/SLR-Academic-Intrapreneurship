AB  - Entrepreneurship education has drawn the attention of many researchers, who aim to better understand and explain the phenomenon in universities and their innovation ecosystems. Although the research feld of entrepreneurship education has advanced, there are still many aspects to be explored, such as the outcomes from university initiatives, evaluating the effectiveness of teaching and learning methods and practices, access and results of Entrepreneurship Support, development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, professor qualifcation, classroom and experimental learning, and students' view. This paper brings a new perspective, both for research and management of entrepreneurial initiatives, showing the need for a more holistic and integrated view of entrepreneurship education with other areas, such as entrepreneurship support at the university, entrepreneurship ecosystem, and the entrepreneurial process. From an extensive literature review, we suggest a theoretical framework for research on entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial university.Alternate abstract:O ensino do empreendedorismo tem atraído a atenção de diversos pesquisadores, com o objetivo de compreender e explicar esse fenômeno nas universidades e seus ecossistemas de inovação. Embora o campo de pesquisa em ensino de empreendedorismo tenha avançado, ainda há muitos aspectos que precisam ser explorados, como os resultados gerados pelas iniciativas universitárias, avaliação da efcácia dos métodos e práticas de ensino e aprendizagem, acesso e resultados do apoio ao empreendedorismo, desenvolvimento do ecossistema empreendedor, formação de professores, aprendizado em sala de aula e experiencial, e perspectivas dos estudantes. Este trabalho tem como objetivo trazer uma nova perspectiva, tanto para a pesquisa quanto para a gestão de iniciativas empreendedoras, apontando a necessidade de uma visão mais holística e integrada do ensino de empreendedorismo com outras áreas, como apoio ao empreendedorismo, ecossistema e processo empreendedor. O resultado da revisão da literatura é uma proposta de modelo teórico para a pesquisa em ensino de empreendedorismo e universidade empreendedora.Alternate abstract:La enseñanza para el emprendimiento ha atraído la atención de diversos investigadores, que buscan comprender y explicar el fenómeno en las universidades y sus ecosistemas de innovación.

T1  - Innovators and transformers: Revisiting the gap between academia and practice: insights from the green logistics phenomenon
AN  - 3202890310
AB  - PurposeLogistics and supply chain management (L&SCM) scholars and practitioners have devoted extensive efforts to advancing green logistics practices (GLPs), yet the intersection between the two domains in relation to the topic remains underexplored. To accelerate GLPs’ development amid the escalating climate crisis, this research examines this intersection by comparing the responsiveness of academia and practice to the call for green logistics over time.Design/methodology/approachTo compare between academia and practice, we combined a systematic literature review on the development of GLPs in L&SCM journals (N = 122) with a content analysis of annual and sustainability reports published by the four major global logistics service providers (LSPs: DHL, DB Schenker, UPS and FedEx; N = 156) over the past three decades.FindingsThis research reveals that all the GLPs covered in the L&SCM literature have already been applied and reported by practitioners, both consistently and over a significant period of time. Academic progress, in turn, is delayed by slow-paced empirical methods, elevated research quality standards, prolonged funding and recruitment processes, and extended peer-review intervals. Further, a tendency toward reactive knowledge creation rather than proactive knowledge transfer is evident, obscuring the role of L&SCM scholars in steering the industry’s green advancement.Practical implicationsRecommendations are offered to L&SCM authors, editors, reviewers and university departments to advance pracademic endeavors in green logistics research and increase its responsiveness to global events.Originality/valueThis is one of the first studies to scrutinize the intersection between academia and practice on the evolution of GLPs. The revealed gaps prompted us to suggest a transformative paradigm for academia-practice collaborations targeting the L&SCM discipline at large, combining a bold proactive research stream aimed at knowledge transfer with a more traditional reactive stream aimed at knowledge creation.

T1  - Business model revisited: a novel canvas for digital transformation
AN  - 3218775979
AB  - PurposeDigital businesses defy the models and theories of traditional entrepreneurship. This study proposes a refined digital business model canvas (DBMC) to address digital entrepreneurship’s unique challenges and opportunities.Design/methodology/approachWe conducted a systematic literature review alongside a double-round validation of semi-structured interviews and qualitative research. We interviewed digital entrepreneurs from university spin-offs until we reached data saturation in the first round, contributing to internal validity. Then, the new model was validated in the second round of interviews.FindingsThe DBMC successfully bridges gaps identified in the conventional BMC by enhancing strategic focus, clarifying financial planning and improving early adopter identification. Validation interviews confirm that the adapted framework is better aligned to the operational realities of digital ventures, reinforcing its theoretical contribution through a nuanced application of the resource-based view.Research limitations/implicationsThe study’s qualitative design and sample from a single innovation agency may limit generalizability; further testing in diverse settings is recommended.Practical implicationsThe DBMC provides a robust, adaptable framework for digital entrepreneurs, offering valuable insights for strategic planning, entrepreneurial education and policy development. It integrates new components – such as early adopters, investment sources, pricing and employee relationships – and adapts existing elements.Originality/valueThe originality is twofold: we examined the business model canvas using additional resources in a digital context, enhancing the likelihood of success for digital business practitioners; we also revamped Barney´s VRIO (value, rarity, imitability and organization) model, stressing the importance of resources and capabilities in the novel (digital) context.

T1  - Cognitive and Psychological Aspects in Academic Entrepreneur Identity and Entrepreneurial Intention: A Systematic Literature Review
AN  - 3215609905
AB  - Objective: to investigate the cognitive and psychological variables shaping academic entrepreneurs' identity and entrepreneurial intention. Methods: a systematic literature review covering 1996 to 2022, using Web of Science and Scopus databases. The analysis involved co-citation network construction and thematic categorization into clusters. Results: four clusters were identified, three interconnected through citations and one isolated. The theory of planned behavior emerged as a framework linking entrepreneurial identities to intentions, explaining how cognitive structures influence entrepreneurial roles. A gap was noted in defining academic entrepreneurial identity. It is suggested to combine the theory of social entrepreneurial identity with interdisciplinarity, incorporating liquid modernity theory and a fluvial metaphor to propose the concept of Liquid Academic Entrepreneurial Identity, opening new research paths. Conclusions: future studies should integrate evolutionary cognitive psychology and social entrepreneurial identity theory to examine how social and cognitive factors interact in identity formation, aiding in developing robust theoretical models and informing academic entrepreneurship policies and interventions.

T1  - Components and factors affecting adolescent resilience promotion education in disasters: a systematic review
AN  - 3165523652
AB  - PurposeCommunity-based disaster management and access to social resilience during disasters are fundamentally based on the concept of participation of all social groups. Up to now, no comprehensive study has been done regarding adolescents’ roles and experiences in all stages of disaster management, and discussions existing in the domain of adolescents’ engagement in disaster risk management are usually restricted to children’s participation. Thus, this study aims to extract the effective components and factors in disaster education to improve adolescents’ resilience to disasters.Design/methodology/approachThis systematic review was done through English databases and three Persian databases between August 18, 2001, and August 31, 2021. The articles were searched based on the PRISMA checklist using four key dimensions of “resilience,” “disasters,” “adolescents” and “education.” Finally, the effective components and factors in disaster education for improving adolescents’ resilience during disasters were extracted.FindingsTotally, 29,856 articles were extracted through the systematic review. After studying the titles, abstracts and contents of the extracted articles, 17 were selected for the final analysis. Among these articles, 3, 12 and 2 had qualitative, quantitative and mixed research designs, respectively. The extracted components were categorized into five major categories including education, community, adolescents, resilience and governing policies and approaches.Research limitations/implicationsUnfortunately, due to sanctions, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences did not have access to the Embase database, and consequently, this database could not be used.Originality/valueThe results of this systematic review presented an overall view of the effective components of adolescents’ disaster resilience education. The formation of thoughts developed feelings, and social knowledge in this age group provides a wide range of opportunities for social empowerment and intergenerational knowledge transfer.

T1  - Applications and Competitive Advantages of Data Mining and Business Intelligence in SMEs Performance: A Systematic Review
AN  - 3223880340
AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face unique challenges that can be effectively addressed through the adoption of data mining and business intelligence (BI) tools. This systematic literature review scrutinizes the deployment and efficacy of BI and data mining technologies across SME sectors, assessing their impact on operational efficiency, strategic decision-making, and market competitiveness. Therefore, drawing from a methodologically rigorous analysis of 93 scholarly articles published between 2014 and 2024, the review elucidates the evolving landscape of BI tools and techniques that have shaped SME practices. It reveals that advanced analytics such as predictive modeling and machine learning are increasingly being adopted, though significant gaps remain, particularly shaped by economic factors. The utilization of BI and data mining enhances decision-making processes and enables SMEs to adapt effectively to market dynamics. Despite these advancements, SMEs encounter barriers such as technological complexity, high implementation costs, and substantial skills gaps, impeding effective utilization. Our review, grounded in the analysis of business intelligence tools used indicates that dashboards (31.18%) and clustering techniques (10.75%) are predominantly utilized, highlighting their strategic importance in operational settings. However, a considerable number of studies (66.67%) do not specify the BI tools or data mining techniques employed, pointing to a need for more detailed methodological transparency in future research. The predominant focus on the ICT and manufacturing sectors underscores the industrial context sector specific applicability of these technologies, with ICT accounting for 45.16% and manufacturing 22.58% of the studies. We advocate for targeted educational programs, development of user-friendly and cost-effective BI solutions, and strategic partnerships to facilitate knowledge transfer and technological empowerment in SMEs. Empirical research validating the impacts of BI and data mining on SME performance is crucial, providing a directional pathway for future academic inquiries and policy formulation.

T1  - Academic Entrepreneurship Ecosystems: Systematic Literature Review and Future Research Directions
AN  - 3168505427
AB  - Research on the entrepreneurship ecosystem, based on different data and scales, limits the acceptance of a single definition. This conceptual limitation and the still recent research and higher education institutions have come to be seen as ecosystems associated with entrepreneurship. The aim of this study is to contribute to the field of knowledge, identify current and emerging thematic areas and trends and reveal the scientific roots of research on entrepreneurial ecosystems and their relationship with higher education institutions. A bibliometric analysis was developed to analyse a final sample of 110 articles published between 2011 and 2022. In order to develop the analysis, Bibliometrix R-Tool was used and the metadata of two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) was retrieved and merged. The software creates a reference co-citation’s map, which allowed emphasize the state of the art and indicate three thematic clusters: (i) the importance of the higher education context for the entrepreneurial ecosystem, (ii) the evolution and challenges of entrepreneurship education and (iii) academic entrepreneurship ecosystems. The paper concludes by suggesting future research focused on the importance of building an integrated approach to entrepreneurial ecosystems and higher education institutions on a context regional scale.

T1  - Academic entrepreneurship in the humanities and social sciences: a systematic literature review and research agenda
AN  - 3123920372
AB  - The predominant empirical focus of academic entrepreneurship research has been in the science, technology and engineering domains. To date there has been a limited research and empirical focus on academic entrepreneurship in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS). This is against a background of the growing societal and policy recognition of the important contributions and impact of HASS based research. The purpose of this paper through a systematic literature review is to examine the current state of academic entrepreneurship research in HASS. Our systematic literature identified four key themes namely, actors,barriers,mechanismsandmeasurementandevaluation. From this, we develop and outline a research agenda for academic entrepreneurship in HASS.

T1  - Entrepreneurial university support and entrepreneurial career: the directions for university policy to influence students’ entrepreneurial intention and behavior
AN  - 3086816213
AB  - PurposeAcademic scholars have tested students’ entrepreneurial intention (SEI) through the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Still, the link between entrepreneurial intention and career is missing in previous studies. An extensive literature review developed the rationale that existing theories in the entrepreneurial discipline have limitations in linking entrepreneurial intention with career. This research is conducted to develop a comprehensive model for the relationship between entrepreneurial university support, student entrepreneurial intention, behavior and career. Stimulus-Organism-Behavior-Consequence (SOBC) paradigm from organizational behavior research is borrowed to entrepreneurship literature.Design/methodology/approachThe cross-sectional data was collected from Pakistani university students enrolled in business incubators. A sample of 100 responses was tested with a partial least square–structural equation modelling approach.FindingsThe study established that by the underpinning of SOBC, entrepreneurial university support influences students’ entrepreneurial intention. It is also found that the students’ entrepreneurial intention strongly influences their entrepreneurial behavior, leading them to entrepreneurship careers.Research limitations/implicationsThe policies influencing students’ entrepreneurial intention and behavior can be developed using the SOBC paradigm. Higher education institutions can improve students’ entrepreneurial intentions and behavior to lead them to entrepreneurship careers.Originality/valueThis research introduced the SOBC paradigm in entrepreneurial intention and behavior literature. SOBC underpinning explored a new dimension of entrepreneurial intention and behavior literature.

T1  - Innovation intermediaries: a review, bibliometric analysis, and research agenda
AN  - 3078841984
AB  - Innovation intermediaries (IIs) have gained more attention in both industry and academia since they are recognized as crucial actors that can facilitate the innovation process. This paper presents a systemic review of the academic research on IIs and suggests future research directions. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 556 documents from the Web of Science with Bibliometrix. The results show that IIs have experienced a surge of publications over the past three decades, with the UK and the US leading in productivity and influence. Although research on IIs occurs globally, cross-national collaboration is lacking, especially between authors of developed and developing countries. Our keyword co-occurrence analysis identified three major research clusters represented by innovation performance, knowledge networks, and technology transfer, which are also reflected in different stages of thematic evolution. Furthermore, we conducted a content analysis of the most influential articles across multiple disciplines and different time slices to identify the key discipline interests and provide a comprehensive picture of research themes over the years. We conclude by suggesting four potential avenues for future research. Our work provides an essential overview for understanding this critical field and serves as a valuable resource for policymakers and practitioners interested in IIs.

T1  - Co-creation and innovation in higher education institutions: a systematic literature review and research agenda
AN  - 3031029206
AB  - PurposeThis systematic literature review aims to identify the main areas of study related to co-creation and innovation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), as well as the main external and internal stakeholders with whom co-creation is made.Design/methodology/approachThe empirical approach is based on 258 articles selected from the Web of Science (WoS), Clarivate Analytics and Scopus, Elsevier databases, with analysis of titles, abstracts and keywords following a research protocol. VOS viewer and CitNetExplorer software were used, with the twin aim of identifying publications with a higher number of citations and designing maps of reference word co-occurrence.FindingsThe analysis led to three clusters being identified: Cluster 1. Management and transfer of knowledge from HEIs to companies; Cluster 2. Co-creation and innovation in HEIs through cooperation between universities and companies; and Cluster 3. Universities’ third mission and their role in developing entrepreneurship education. The results of the literature clusters analysis led to proposing a conceptual model of analysis.Research limitations/implicationsDespite only employing two databases and the content analysis criteria, the three found clusters are linked, recognising the interplay between co-creation and innovation in HEIs, knowledge transfer to enterprises and the influence on HEIs' third goal.Practical implicationsThis systematic literature review highlights and gives a picture of the state-of-the-art in co-creation and innovation in HEIs, as well as presenting a model of co-creation and innovation in HEIs that can contribute to reinforcing the University-Industry-Community ties.Social implicationsThis study can lead to a better knowledge of the issue of co-creation and innovation at HEIs, as well as a deeper analysis of the sorts of relationships between HEIs and their stakeholders, as well as its impact on surrounding areas and influence.Originality/valueThe research highlights the interaction between HEIs and their stakeholders on a basis of value co-creation and innovation, providing mutual benefits for all involved, as well as greater development and recognition of HEIs and their surrounding regions’ image andreputation. A future research agenda is also presented on the topic of co-creation and innovation in HEIs.

AN  - 2932453560
AB  - The main purpose of this research is to analyze the exploration and exploitation of knowledge in universities that support innovation and entrepreneurship in their environment. For this, the Performance Measurement Systems (PMS) of the universities management are analyzed as a proxy for the implementation of the strategic vision of the universities. This study is based on a systematic literature review on the subject, supported by the technical possibilities offered by the MAXQDA (The Art of Data Analysis) program. The databases used were the following: Elsevier (Science Direct), Springer, Wiley and Taylor & Francis. The main findings suggest that organizational ambidexterity, in general, develops unevenly and from different approaches, among which innovation, learning and strategy stand out. However, organizational ambidexterity hardly develops in a university context, where most of the university activities require some knowledge of the technological frontier. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and understand these two dimensions (exploration and exploitation) and their positive influence on entrepreneurship. In a context where the development of technology and science happens at an ever-increasing speed, a balance between exploration and exploitation is necessary, which should be reflected in the different control mechanisms in academic environments, such as the Performance Measurement Systems (PMS). The analysis of these systems will allow to know the position of the universities in the face of ambidexterity.

T1  - Critical success factors in creating entrepreneurial universities: A case of Botswana
AN  - 3114240200
AB  - Even with the urgent need for public universities to transform into entrepreneurial universities in Botswana, very little is known especially in developing countries such as Botswana on what it takes to transform. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the critical success factors for the creation of entrepreneurial universities in Botswana. Our core research question asks: What are the critical success factors for the transformation of public universities into entrepreneurial universities? The study used a descriptive literature review methodology to collect secondary data. A data set of 150 articles were reviewed which dated from 1987 to 2024. Data sources identified were books, academic journals, academic papers, technical reports, theses, articles, and working papers from reputable academic databases such as Scopus, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ProQuest, Research Gate, Scientific Research Publishing and Wiley. The study revealedfour main success factors in creating entrepreneurial universities - strategic, internal, environmental and external. The study underscored the need for resources, entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurial leadership and entrepreneurial culture in the creation of an entrepreneurial university. Moreover, flexible governance structure, enterprise support policies, role model and reward system, entrepreneurial architecture and collaborations with stakeholders were also highlighted as crucial for a successful transformation of public universities into entrepreneurial universities. The study further revealed that the transformation requires external support mechanisms from government, industry, and regional interventions. Consequently, creating an entrepreneurial university requires a collective effort between the university itself, government, industry and regional interventions. The implication is that public universities should forge partnerships and synergies with external stakeholders to transform into entrepreneurial universities. In light of the above, the study recommends the adoption of a quadruple helix model in creating entrepreneurial universities. Future research is recommended to fully evaluate the efficacy of the quadruple helix model in the development of an entrepreneurial university. The study contributes to the body of knowledge and global debates surrounding the creation of entrepreneurial universities.

T1  - HR actors’ responses to institutional contradictions: a systematic review
AN  - 3093152941
AB  - Human resource management literature has increasingly focused on institutional complexity and action. We conducted a systematic review of HR actors' responses to institutional contradictions, which contained two questions: the first question identifies what institutional contradictions HR actors face and the second question reviewed HR actors' responses to these contradictions. We identified 52 articles for analysis after the screening. First, an overview of the theoretical lens, contexts, and dimensions of action in selected articles was presented. Then institutional contradictions including institutional pressures and conflict were reviewed and presented. Also, the types of actions were extracted and categorized from the articles. We presented a typology of four types of actions including (A) proactive legitimacy actions (institutional work, institutional entrepreneurship, and deinstitutionalization), (B) proactive institutional practices (combining logic, aligning interpretations, logic customization, and structural actions), (C) reactive institutional practices (use of logic, reducing tension, reconciliation and rejecting) and (D) reactive legitimacy actions (localization, adaptation, compliance, and institutional fit). This typology has two aspects: the type of actors' exposure to contradiction (proactive and reactive) and the direction of action (The Impact on the institutional context and conversely). Also, the epistemological distinctions of these four types of actions, the time and theoretical trends of the emergence of these actions in research, and the relevant conceptual framework were presented. Finally, directions for future research, discussion, and conclusions were described.

T1  - Barriers and facilitators of university-industry collaboration for research, development and innovation: a systematic review
AN  - 3093152812
AB  - Cooperation in research, development and innovation (RD&I) between universities or research institutes and industries plays a fundamental role in the economic development of a country. Industry benefits from state-of-the-art laboratories and technologies from academia, while institutes learn about business reality and market needs. Numerous barriers to the establishment and maintenance of these partnerships have been investigated and reported in the literature, but the information generated by these empirical studies is very fragmented and there is a need to consider the barriers systematically in order to clarify the topic. The aims of this systematic review were to analyze university-industry collaborations set up for the purpose of RD&I in an effort to recognize the barriers and facilitators of the process and to identify the approaches by which such barriers may be overcome. Following searches of the Scopus database and application of the exclusion criteria, 86 relevant articles were identified and submitted to bibliometric analysis. Subsequently, 75 articles were selected for in-depth content analysis, and the ideas embodied therein were presented in a structured and comprehensive manner. Barriers were evaluated according to three different theoretical perspectives, namely the triple helix and the entrepreneurial university, the relational social capital and value creation, and technology transfer and cultural differences. The facilitators were categorized as internal and external. The results obtained highlight the importance of fostering relational social capital and providing tax incentives to facilitate industry's pursuit of innovation through academia partnerships, and also show that collaborative barriers in RD&I may be overcome to some extent by starting with smaller projects and gradually increasing their complexity. Based on the findings outlined in this review, we propose various lines for future research.

T1  - Supply Chain Complexity and Its Impact on Knowledge Transfer: Incorporating Sustainable Supply Chain Practices in Food Supply Chain Networks
AN  - 3003314731
AB  - Background: The dynamics of supply chain networks have changed due to increasing complexities. Global expansions and knowledge transfer in supply chain networks bring efficiency and effectiveness to companies. However, the probability of supply chain complexity has also been seen increasing. The barriers to sustainable supply chain networks need to be tackled in an effective manner as they impact business operations. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate and reduce the supply chain complexities, as it will facilitate the process of knowledge transfer and increase the implementation of sustainable practises in supply chain networks. In the previous research, four supply chain complexity drivers were identified. Previous research identified four supply chain complexity drivers by conducting a systematic review. This study investigates which of the four complexity drivers impacts knowledge transfer in the context of the food supply chain sector. Methods: In this research, knowledge transfer is therefore examined from the perspective of sustainable food supply chains. Thirty exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted in this study and analysed using Nvivo (v12) software. This study utilised thematic analysis techniques for the evaluation of the interviews to gather results. Results: The results illustrated six main factors classified under broad categories: integration of Knowledge Transfer, incorporation of technological advancements in supply chain networks, supply chain complexity solutions, supply chain complexity drivers, sustainable supply chain networks, and capability to reduce supply chain complexity. The findings of this study highlight that process complexity significantly influences the process of knowledge transfer in food supply chain networks. The research findings contribute to both academic and practical domains. This study contributes to the aggregation of supply chain complexity and its impact on Knowledge Transfer. Additionally, the findings support supply chain networks, which strive to achieve efficient Knowledge Transfer to attain sustainable value in business operations. Conclusion: This study has proven that robust knowledge transfer reduces supply chain complexity as it makes supply chain systems more resilient and well-coordinated in many potential ways.

T1  - Development of university–industry partnership in Armenia: university perspective
AN  - 2913033239
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate university–industry partnerships in Armenia from the viewpoint of universities. By doing so, it contributes to the existing literature on university–industry collaboration by identifying and addressing the specific challenges that impede the establishment of successful university–industry partnerships in Armenia and other post-Soviet countries.Design/methodology/approachA comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the barriers, benefits and institutional, functional framework of collaboration. Additionally, this study used a survey methodology to gather data from faculty managing staff members at six Armenian higher educational institutions on various aspects of university–industry collaboration as well as the perceptions and experiences of the participants.FindingsThe results show that the effectiveness and applicability of the university–industry collaboration channels and institutional structures in six higher educational institutions are limited. Specifically, the channels that rely on academic entrepreneurship and innovation were found to be currently unviable. Moreover, the existence of spin-offs and start-ups is notably absent. Furthermore, limited access to funding and inadequate entrepreneurial support systems pose significant barriers to developing university–industry partnerships in Armenian reality.Originality/valueThis study represents a pioneering effort within the context of Armenian higher educational institutions, as it is the first time a survey has been organized to specifically investigate the topic of university–industry partnerships. Before this study, there was a lack of empirical research and data collection on this topic in Armenian higher education settings. Therefore, this research holds significant originality and contributes to filling the existing gap in knowledge regarding university–industry partnerships in Armenia. The research is shedding light on a previously unexplored area and providing a valuable contribution to the field of university–industry collaboration research in Armenia and other post-Soviet countries.

T1  - Education 4.0 Maturity Models for Society 5.0: Systematic literature review
AN  - 2902248241
AB  - Society 5.0 is a transformative vision for the future driven by integrating digital technologies and human-centered approaches, fusing with cyber-physical spaces to create a smart society that addresses megatrends through innovative and collaborative solutions by stakeholders. This article analyzes Maturity Models (MMs) in Higher Education to identify the components of Education 4.0 that aim to achieve Society 5.0, seeking the dimensions and levels associated with the quintuple helix and the mission of the HEIs. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) guided by research questions to highlight studies that address Maturity Models worldwide, identify components of Education 4.0 in the MM, research methods and instruments used, internal and external stakeholders, and some characteristics of the university missions. The study method employed was a Systematic Review analyzing 26 articles from 2018 to 2023 found in WoS and Scopus databases using inclusion and exclusion criteria under a Prisma workflow. The findings were that the HEIs must: a) analyze dimensions of various Education 4.0 components in a balanced way, b) incorporate comparative designs and mixed methods of the MM models, c) provide technology transfer services, training, and data centers, d) provide fully open environments to educate all citizens inclusively, and e) use sustainable MMs for a significant difference in impact. This review offers educational leaders and policymakers the methodologies for measuring the Education 4.0 path to Society 5.0.

T1  - Entrepreneurial Engagement of Faculty in Higher Educational Institutions: A Review of Literature 2011–2023
AN  - 2898341364
AB  - The article provides a systematic literature review on faculty entrepreneurial engagement from 2011 onwards. Faculty entrepreneurial engagement means faculty participation in all different activities that lead to fulfilling Higher Educational Institution’s all three missions—teaching, research and entrepreneurship. The article consolidated research on the concept of faculty entrepreneurial engagement, its scope, determinants and prominent antecedents. Research results suggest that faculty entrepreneurial engagement has two dimensions—faculty can be academic entrepreneur or entrepreneurial academic—two forms of engagement, formal and informal. Their effective participation is influenced by array of individual, organizational and institutional factors. Faculty participation is often stimulated by entrepreneurial eco-system built and motivation provided by organizations which is the scope of future research.

T1  - The soft skills bases in digital academic entrepreneurship in relation to digital transformation: Revista de Administracao e Inovacao
AN  - 2888414211
AB  - PurposeDigital technology changes the organizational structure of traditional firms, creating opportunities for entrepreneurship. These modifications are known as “digital transformation” (DT). In addition, higher education institutions (HEIs) are altering the form of student–lecturer and teaching–learning interaction, where DT restructures the bases of soft skills (SS). Since SS are difficult to measure, this study aims to analyze the bases of SS for digital academic entrepreneurship, responding to the following research question: What are the bases of digital academic entrepreneurship and how are they formed?Design/methodology/approachAn extensive integrative review of the literature revealed that due to the editable, re-combinable, reprogrammable and generating nature of digital technology, the basis of DT, it is necessary to develop SS in higher education students.FindingsThe results show that the competencies can be developed considering three major groupings: (1) individual characteristics, (2) cultural characteristics and (3) knowledge sharing.Practical implicationsSince SS are not easily taught, this study shows how the use of digital tools can help and support this type of process. It is suggested, therefore, that those in charge of HEIs should use the pillars presented in the framework proposed here to guide their institutions' strategic planning. With these pillars in mind, the aim is to stimulate an entrepreneurial mentality in students and develop digital academic entrepreneurship.Originality/valueAn innovative conceptual model of digital academic entrepreneurship is proposed from the perspective of SS, where the interlinking of those groupings is permeated by DT, as well as the disruptive role of digital technology, leading to the development of an entrepreneurial mentality in HEI students.

T1  - The international orientation of academic entrepreneurship: the role of relational, human and psychological capital
AN  - 2806385349
AB  - Purpose Scholars have emphasized intellectual capital’s importance for universities in obtaining competitive advantages and creating value. The purpose of this paper is to identify the influences of two components of intellectual capital, relational and human capital at the international level, and psychological capital on international orientation of academic entrepreneurs, and the mediating effects of international relational and human capital.Design/methodology/approach On the basis of a literature review, a theoretical model is proposed to explain the relationship between the studied variables. Our hypotheses are tested on a sample of 173 academic spin-offs of Spanish universities using bootstrapping methodology.Findings The results show that the international market relational capital and international human capital of academic entrepreneurs influence their international orientation, and that their psychological capital is directly, and indirectly, related to international orientation through international human capital and international market relational capital.Practical implications This study provides a better understanding of the antecedents of the international orientation of academic entrepreneurs, which would provide an important contribution to the literature on intellectual capital, academic entrepreneurship and internationalization. The achieved results highlight important implications for training of academic entrepreneurs and for managers and management teams of companies willing to enter, or even those already operating in, international markets.Originality/value In this study, the international orientation of academic entrepreneurs is explained through the psychological capital that is studied jointly with two components of intellectual capital, relational and human capital at the international level. Although some recent work has focused on the study of the internationalization of academic spin-off, this line of research is still incipient.

T1  - Nurturing Teaching Methods of Entrepreneurship in the Development of An Entrepreneurial University
AN  - 2813115192
AB  - The nurturing of an entrepreneurial university is essential since it creates an important place to teach the key themes of entrepreneurship. This paper provides a literature review and discusses the various definitions of the entrepreneurial university and its development factors. This paper uses [Kearnay’s (1999). Enterprising Ways to Teach and Learn, a series of books, Enterprise Principles. Enterprise Design Associates. Tasmania, Australia: North Hobart] pedagogical approach on the development of the entrepreneurial university to create an empirical survey administered to 250 university professors in Tunisia. The results of this study illustrate that Kearnay’s pedagogical approach [Kearney, P (1999). Enterprising Ways to Teach and Learn, a series of books, Enterprise Principles. Enterprise Design Associates. Tasmania, Australia: North Hobart] (responsive, experiential, reflective, and cooperative pedagogy) positively influences the development of the entrepreneurial university. We conclude with an original teaching method framework to cultivate an entrepreneurial spirit in university students to facilitate an entrepreneurial university.

T1  - A Systematic Literature Review of Individual Predictors on Internet Entrepreneurial Ventures among Academics
TT  - Tinjauan Literatur Sistematik Peramal Individu dalam Usaha Keusahawanan Internet di kalangan Ahli Akademik
AN  - 2928342123
AB  - Pengaruh pensyarah universiti yang mengajar, tetapi tidak mengamalkan, keusahawanan merupakan persoalan penting yang dihadapi keusahawanan akademik. Literatur semasa kurang berbincang mengenai peramal penting untuk menjadi seorang usahawan, terutamanya dalam kalangan pensyarah. Oleh kerana perkembangan teknologi membolehkan seseorang pensyarah menjadi usahawan internet, kajian ini menjalankan kajian literatur sistematik terhadap artikel berkaitan dengan peramal individu yang boleh menjejaskan usahawan internet dalam kalangan ahli akademik. Tiga puluh lima artikel yang diterbitkan di antara tahun 2012 dan 2022 diperoleh daripada Clarivate Web of Science diringkas, disemak, dan disintesis. Dapatan kajian menunjukkan bahawa modal insan, modal sosial, dan kecekapan internet merupakan peramal individu penting yang mempengaruhi usaha keusahawanan internet dalam kalangan pensyarah. Kajian ini juga mencadangkan penggunaan pembolehubah keempat baharu iaitu efikasi keusahawanan internet akademik untuk menjelaskan fenomena keusahawanan internet akademik dalam kalangan pensyarah. Kajian ini menyumbang kepada pemahaman peramal individu yang mempengaruhi usahawan internet dalam kalangan ahli akademik iaitu pensyarah boleh bertindak sebagai pendidik dan menjadi usahawan pada masa yang sama. Oleh itu, adalah penting bagi pensyarah untuk mengembangkan kemahiran keusahawanan mereka sama ada secara teori mahupun amali.Alternate abstract:The influence of university lecturers who teach, but do not practice, entrepreneurship is an important question facing academic entrepreneurship. Current literature lacks discussions regarding important predictors for becoming an entrepreneur, especially among lecturers. Because technological developments make it possible for a lecturer to become an internet entrepreneur, this study conducted a systematic literature review of articles related to identifying individual predictors that can affect internet entrepreneurial ventures among academics. Thirty-five articles published between 2012 and 2022 and sourced from the Clarivate Web of Science are summarized, reviewed, and synthesized. The findings show that human capital, social capital, and internet competence are important individual predictors that influence internet entrepreneurial ventures among lecturers. This study also proposes the use of a new fourth variable, academic internet entrepreneurial self-efficacy, to explain the phenomenon of academic internet entrepreneurship among lecturers. This study contributes to the understanding of individual predictors that influence internet entrepreneurial ventures among academics and whether lecturers can act as educators and entrepreneurs at the same time. Therefore, it is important for lecturers to develop their entrepreneurial skills both in theory and practice.

T1  - Trends and Opportunities in Social Entrepreneurship Education Research
AN  - 2892936033
AB  - The objective is analyzing the trends in Social Entrepreneurship Education as a multidisciplinary research field. A systematic review of the literature on the intersection: Education and Social Entrepreneurship, with the support of scientific literature and a careful search methodology. It collects articles from the WOS Core collection database published between 2000 and 2022. A total of 367 articles are analyzed to answer the three research questions. The results of the analysis are twelve dimensions identified according to the literature in the field of social entrepreneurship education; after using lexicometric analysis and Iramuteq software, the main trends on the topics are found and discussed and the relationship of terms and concepts in the abstract and title text of the analyzed articles is shown, showing the frequency, importance of linkage, and co-occurrences of lexical units. Six clusters of nodes and related terms are confirmed: entrepreneur, development and innovation, education, entrepreneurial university, context, and types of study. These clusters show the concern for the field of study of social entrepreneurship education and the need to find a consensus on the concept of an entrepreneur and on what is social entrepreneurship in education. The wide range of topics, dispersed and fragmented, continues to offer opportunities for specificity.

T1  - Entrepreneurial Intention of University Students under the Perspective of the Theory of Planned Behaviour: Integrative Literature Review
AN  - 2892935362
AB  - (1) Background: In a competitive and globalised world, retaining immigrants in entrepreneurial universities is an underutilised asset, one that allows economic development to be better enabled. Thus, studying the entrepreneurial intention (EI) of students enables the development of practices and public policies. (2) Purpose: Although the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is not a recent approach, its theoretical framework was considered consistent to understand the entrepreneurial intention (EI) of university students, considering the geographic region of origin. (3) Methods: This article is an integrative literature review. The database consulted was the Web of Science. Works available in full until 2022 that addressed at least two TPB antecedents were included. Works that were not articles that included university students were excluded. (4) Results: The articles analysed confirm the predictive power of the theory. However, more standardised studies need to address the role of variables. The African results showed a greater entrepreneurial attitude; Americans and Asians perceived greater behavioural control; and the subjective norm was stronger among Africans. (5) Originality: This work contributes to fomenting attention to this field, providing the development of theories, and suggesting avenues for future research. The authors did not find a literature review on the subject.

T1  - A bibliometric review of research on entrepreneurial capacity for the period 1979 to 2022: Current status, development, and future research directions
AN  - 2814203712
AB  - This study deals with the primary areas and the present dynamics related to entrepreneurial capacity (EC); apart from this, it provides research directions in EC’s research field that would be of use in the future. With the aid of bibliometric analysis, we analysed Google Scholar, Scopus, and the ISI Web of Science databases and arrived at 193 studies that we use as samples; these studies enable us to recognise the research activity conducted on EC from 1979 to 2022. The most influential articles and authors have been identified based on their publications, citations, location, and importance within the network. Apart from this, we investigate current themes, discover barriers to development in literature, and provide ways for future research. Although research activity on EC occurs globally, there is a shortage of studies concerning developing countries’ context; countries experience a lack of collaboration, which is observed explicitly between the authors of developing and developed countries. This research focuses on broadly two themes: entrepreneurship education (EE) as an antecedent of EC, which, in turn, is an antecedent to entrepreneurial intention (EI), and EC as an antecedent factor of firm performance and economic growth. Interestingly, there is also a rising focus on Entrepreneurial Universities. We conclude by suggesting potential research directions.

TT  - MAPALUS COMO PRÁTICA DE TRANSFERENCIA DE CONHECIMENTO PARA MELHORAR A CAPACIDADE DE INOVAÇÂO: SUCESSO OU NÄO SUCESSO?
AN  - 2787280225
AB  - Objetivo: Este estudo tem como objetivo descrever a relaçâo entre a cultura Mapalus local como uma forma prática de transferencia de conhecimento da literatura academica. Referencial teórico: O conhecimento hoje em dia é considerado valioso e pode continuar crescendo junto com seu uso. Portanto, acreditava-se que a transferencia de conhecimento era um fator essencial para implementar recursos de conhecimento e fomentar a inovaçâo nas organizaçöes. A transferencia de conhecimento é uma forma de troca de informaçöes, conhecimentos, experiencias, ideias e sugestöes, que se pensa ter uma relaçâo com a cultura Mapalus. Portanto, presume-se também que mapalus é transferencia de conhecimento nas práticas. Método: Literature review approach to see the deeper links between knowledge transfer and local culture mapalus and interviews with several knowledge management experts and mapalus cultural experts. Resultados e conclusão: O estudo encontrou resultados contraditórios em relaçâo ao mapalus. Vários investigadores nacionais explicam que a cultura mapalus ainda está bem implementada; alguns pesquisadores explicam que o mapalus começou a perder sua identidade original devido a entrada de transaçöes financeiras. Implicates da pesquisa: pesquisas contraditórias sobre mapalus levantam dúvidas de que a transferencia de conhecimento poderia ser praticada por meio de atividades culturais mapalus que podem näo ser capazes de promover capacidades de inovaçâo na sociedade e o objetivo de reduzir a pobreza de Mapalus pode näo ser realizado se perder sua identidade original. Originalidade/valor: The present study is unique, where it offers the meaningful explanation mapalus culture and its relation on knowledge transfer in local society.Alternate abstract:Purpose: This study aims to describe the relationship between local Mapalus culture as a practical form of knowledge transfer from academic literature. Theoretical framework: Knowledge nowadays is considered valuable and can keep increasing along with its use. Therefore, knowledge transfer was believed to be an essential factor in implementing knowledge resources and fostering innovation in organizations. Knowledge transfer is a form of information, expertise, experience, idea, and suggestion exchange, which is thought to have a relationship with the Mapalus culture. Therefore, it is also presumed that mapalus is knowledge transfer in practices. Method/design/approach: Literature review approach to see the deeper links between knowledge transfer and local culture mapalus and interviews with several knowledge management experts and mapalus cultural experts. Results and conclusion: The study found contradictory results relating to mapalus. Several national researchers explain that mapalus culture is still well implemented; some researchers explain mapalus has started to lose its original identity due to the entry of financial transactions. Research implications: contradictory research about mapalus raises doubts that knowledge transfer could be practiced through mapalus cultural activities that may not be able to foster innovation capabilities in society and Mapalus goal of reducing poverty may not be realized if lost its original identity. Originality/value: The present study is unique, where it offers the meaningful explanation mapalus culture and its relation on knowledge transfer in local society.

T1  - Inter-organizational relationships in agri-food sector: a bibliometric review and future directions
AN  - 2756915574
AB  - Purpose>The current competitive system, complex and rapidly changing, knowledge represents one of the main strategic resources for organizations. Agri-food organizations, traditionally characterized by low-knowledge management (KM) practices, are facing several challenges that require new knowledge to improve performance and their ability to survive. Since agri-food organizations are low-propensity R&D, they are forced into a collaborative approach and the creation of inter-organizational relationships (IORs) for knowledge transfer. The purpose of this study is to offer an overview of the academic literature on knowledge transfer within scientific institutions and agri-food organizations.Design/methodology/approach>This study is based on a systematic literature review. In particular, two international and multidisciplinary databases (Scopus and WoS) were considered. Subsequently, the scientific documents were selected following the PRISMA guidelines. In addition, a scientific landscape visualization was created through VOSviewer software.Findings>The study offers interesting reflections and suggestions on the management of inter-organizational relations in the agri-food sector. In particular, it highlights the importance of the “knowledge” resource in IORs. For this reason, IORs and KM represent a challenge for agri-food organizations.Originality/value>The main limitation lies in its criteria for collecting and selecting articles. The study is based on the analysis of articles contained only in two scientific databases (Scopus and WoS) and refined by “Business, Management and Accounting”, “Social Sciences” and “Economics, Econometrics and Finance” areas.

T1  - University-Industry Technology Transfer in India: a Plausible Model Based on Success Stories from the USA, Japan, and Israel
AN  - 2674139243
AB  - Patenting and technology commercialization activities are rapidly gaining momentum in Indian academia. Currently, there is paucity of data suggesting technology commercialization activities among Indian academia. This study aims to examine issues regarding technology commercialization among Indian academics. The objectives of this study are to (1) understand the policy implications of university-industry technology transfer and (2) propose a conceptual model for technology transfer suitable for Indian scenario. The data included for our analysis is drawn from our previous study of 25 Indian Universities. The orientation of the paper is as follows: “Literature Review” is subdivided into two sub-sections — “Policies Implemented for Leveraging Successful Academic Research Commercialization in the USA, Japan, and Israel” and “University Research Commercialization — Case Studies of Universities in the USA, Japan, and Israel” are presented. “Methodology” deals with the methodology used for the study. “Discussion” is further subdivided into three sections — “Analysis and Comparisons of Policy Implications on University-Industry Technology Transfer,” “Practice of Academic Technology Transfer in Indian Universities/Institutes,” and “Conceptual Model Recommended for University-Industry Tech Commercialization in India.” “Conclusion” concludes the topic. The current practices of academia-industry knowledge commercialization in India are limited, and the paper is an attempt to propose a suitable model to encourage commercialization activities by Indian universities.

AN  - 2735285531
AB  - A definiçao de um modelo (framework) para universidade empreendedora (UE), em conjunto com a definiçao de elementos e características que levam â sua existencia, tém sido amplamente discutidos na literatura. Este estudo visa identificar frameworks conceituais para UE prevalentes. A amostra inicial constitui-se de 181 pesquisas extraídas do banco de dados Web of Science e Scopus, a partir da seleçao dos materiais realizamos uma análise de referencias para identificaçao de estudos adicionais. Posteriormente foi realizada uma análise de conteúdo em 50 artigos, que tornou possível a identificaçao de doze frameworks distintos para UE desde 1998 a 2021. Entre as principais contributes destaca-se: Reestruturaçao interna, inovaçao, internacionalizaçâo, hibridizaçao, P&D, sustentabilidade, interaçao de forma globalizada com empresas, associaçöes e instituiçöes, metodologías ativas, pesquisa de alta intensidade, entre outros aspectos. Elementos esses que de forma conjunta elevam o patamar das instituiçöes. Por fim, o ineditismo concentra-se na elaboraçao de um framework final, que sintetiza os modelos que a literatura apresenta, sendo que as abordagens teóricas em suma, seguem a teoria institucional e a teoria económica e, implicitamente, sao integrados por fatores ambientais formais e informais que influenciam positiva ou negativamente o processo de desenvolvimento da universidade em diferentes graus.Alternate abstract:The definition of a model (framework) for an entrepreneurial university (EU), together with the definition of elements and characteristics that lead to its existence, have been widely discussed in the literature. This study aims to identify frameworks concepts for EU prevalent. The initial sample consisted of 181 surveys extracted from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. From the selection of materials, we performed a reference analysis to identify additional studies. Subsequently, a content analysis was carried out on 50 articles, which made it possible to identify twelve different frameworks for the EU from 1998 to 2021. Internal restructuring, innovation, internationalization, hybridization, R&D, sustainability, global interaction with companies, associations and institutions, active methodologies, high-intensity research, among other aspects. These elements jointly raise the level of institutions. Finally, the novelty focuses on the elaboration of a final framework, which synthesizes the models that the literature presents, and the theoretical approaches, in short, follow institutional theory and economic theory and, implicitly, are integrated by formal environmental factors. and informal ones that positively or negatively influence the university development process to different degrees.

T1  - Entrepreneurial University Challenges and Critical Success Factors to Thrive
AN  - 2904579773
AB  - Higher education and universities have transformed due to the evolution of knowledge-based societies. This also led to the rise and growth of the “entrepreneurial university” concept. Factors that promote entrepreneurial universities include funding, self-reliance, academic freedom, better linkage to industry, innovation, provide employment, and promote social and economic development. Hence, worldwide, entrepreneurial universities are increasingly recognized as an important constituent to tackle fiscal and employment issues. However various reports and studies reflect that entrepreneurial universities have not achieved these objectives. That may be due to the challenges and lack of critical success factors (CSFs) understanding to be entrepreneurial university. Hence, adopting an exploratory approach with a systematic literature review this paper intends to focus on the challenges of entrepreneurial universities and identifies the CSFs to thrive as entrepreneurial universities, and provides recommendations to succeed as entrepreneurial universities.

T1  - Student Entrepreneurship in Universities: The State-of-the-Art
AN  - 2642327081
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to understand how universities develop and support student entrepreneurship. We did a preliminary Systematic Literature Review (SRL) on scientific articles regarding student entrepreneurship published during the last twenty years. Our findings emphasize three main research areas, emerging from a cluster analysis: (i) student entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention; (ii) university support for entrepreneurship; (iii) entrepreneurship education and learning. Particularly, our study points out that the new paradigm of the entrepreneurial university overcame the classical university model through the introduction of many innovations to foster student entrepreneurship. This paper provides an SLR on university role in fostering student entrepreneurship and it is useful for the academic and professional community. Additionally, it is original because it highlights the future directions of entrepreneurship and the main innovations adopted by universities to help students in the development of entrepreneurial initiatives.

T1  - Taking scientific inventions to market: Mapping the academic entrepreneurship ecosystem
AN  - 2604553920
AB  - The active contribution of academic institutions to the technological, social and economic development of societies is of increasing importance. To better understand this contribution, we present a systematic review, together with bibliometric and network analyses of the academic entrepreneurship literature. This provides a map of the main topics approached by scholars, thereby illustrating the scientific scenario of the field. Our findings identify three highly interconnected research activity domains that characterize the multidimensional features of entrepreneurship in the academic setting, as well as a significant gap in the literature regarding studies evaluating approaches to support the navigation of potential scientific discoveries to the market. We organize our findings into a four stages framework consisting of: idea inception; the recognition of how this idea unlocks value for customers and other stakeholders; development of an innovative business model; and a commercialization strategy that creates real impact. We discuss the relevance of each stage for the establishment of a more innovation-friendly environment and conclude by offering perspectives into future research opportunities and by encouraging studies that consider the academic entrepreneurship process from a systemic perspective, to support a greater contribution of academic institutions to the economic and social development of the nations and societies.

T1  - Experiential Entrepreneurship Education and the student-focused Entrepreneurial University
TT  - EEE and the student-focused University
AN  - 2594371030
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the provision and reported outcomes of Experiential Entrepreneurship Education (EEE), from learner, educator and university perspectives, in order to reflect upon the progress of the Entrepreneurial University. It proposes a conceptual framework for integrating the multiple stakeholder perspectives for an “education led” and student-focused Entrepreneurial University, something yet to be identified from existing research and, consequentially, future research.Design/methodology/approachA reflective literature review explores the depth and breadth of EEE provision in Universities, noting: what is taking place, who is involved, where EEE is situated (within the university context), and how the knowledge base is informed. From these reflections, a conceptual framework is proposed as a means of exploring and categorizing progress towards a student-focused Entrepreneurial University through education experiences.FindingsThe literature review is largely informed by case studies developed by educators reflecting on student learner experiences for the purpose of course enhancement. These case exemplars provide the resource for emergent, bottom-up strategy that could support the Entrepreneurial University. However, the role of the University is less researched, in terms of providing context and external strategic relationships to resource EEE and deliver a more planned approach to the Entrepreneurial University. The Entrepreneurial University and EEE are mainstream agendas and the development of both must consider the role and contribution of the University in terms of strategy formulation and implementation.Originality/valueThis study takes a holistic view, seeing EEE and the Entrepreneurial University as connected agendas. The student-focused Entrepreneurial University cannot result from emergent, bottom-up strategy alone and thus there is a need to address the role of top-down resource-based University strategy in creating real progress. The paper provides a conceptualization, for the purpose of analysing and informing the relationship between EEE and the Entrepreneurial University that places the University as a key stakeholder, and in doing so asks that scholars and educators build the knowledge base not only from cases of good practice but also from the review of strategic management within Universities.

T1  - The multiple faces of the entrepreneurial university: a review of the prevailing theoretical approaches
AN  - 2550949314
AB  - The importance and the definition of an entrepreneurial university (EU), together with the factors that lead to its existence, have been widely discussed in the literature. Moreover, in recent years, the EU has also been the target of some public policies. This study aims to identify the different theoretical approaches to entrepreneurial universities prevalent in the literature. Using information from the Web of Science database, we performed a co-citation bibliometric analysis, which made it possible to identify six distinct EU approaches: the triple helix model, the knowledge society model, the global perspective, the researcher-entrepreneur model, the dual personality approach, and also a frenzied approach.

T1  - Entrepreneurial universities: A bibliometric analysis within the business and management domains
AN  - 2528500796
AB  - This study presents a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications investigating entrepreneurial universities in the business and management fields. The authors collected 511 documents from the Web of Science and analysed them using Bibliometrix, an RStudio package for performance analysis and science mapping. The study aims to provide an overview of the evolution of research about this topic and describe the structures (i.e., conceptual, social, and intellectual) characterising it. It discusses the results to identify the main areas addressed so far and highlight gaps in the literature, offering avenues for possible future research. The results show that publications on entrepreneurial universities started over 30 years ago and show an increasing trend, more than tripling in the last 10 years. Considering authors and documents as a unit of analysis, the US and Europe perform well in terms of productivity and relevance, but the phenomenon is globally relevant. The contribution to socio-economic development, especially in developing countries, is a hot topic for future studies. Despite increasing production rates, research on this topic remains fragmented, justifying the need for more systematisation. Furthermore, the paper offers policy makers and practitioners a useful baseline for developing entrepreneurial universities and considering their technological, managerial, and organisational implications.

T1  - Exploring Strategies for Developing Entrepreneurial Behavior of Students in Romanian Universities
AN  - 2811203933
AB  - Throughout this research paper we want to emphasize the correlations of theory and practice regarding the topic of the entrepreneurial university. The research combines a two-level approach by correlating both a qualitative-bibliometric analysis and a quantitative exploratory analysis. To identify the theoretical descriptors of the “entrepreneurial university” concept we performed a cluster analysis by using VOSviewer software selecting the published articles in the Scopus database since its beginning. The relevance of this analysis consists in the opportunity of extracting the most relevant information on the analyzed topic according to several criteria such as keywords, co-occurrence, co-citation, or publication topics by year. From this perspective the pieces of evidence are meaningful and we shall present them within the sections of the paper. On the other hand, for obtaining a practice grounded perspective, we applied 350 questionnaires to a target group involved in a university grant for young entrepreneurs. The purpose of the survey was to determine a series of characteristics and patterns of behavior of respondents related to their entrepreneurial orientation. The questionnaire contained a large number of variables for each individual to identify his/her distinct options and thus to draw the big picture. The variables were grouped into 6 dimensions which we identified as a priority for the entrepreneurial orientation framework: personal traits, motivation, attitude, framework conditions, and skills and knowledge. We statistically processed the survey data to identify the most meaningful correlations and interdependencies between the variables. The results of both research protocols are correlated and argued within the final section of the paper followed by conclusions and further research tracks.

T1  - Exploring Critical Factors for Academic Start-ups towards the Development of Technological Entrepreneurship: Preliminary Research Findings
AN  - 2639731053
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study is to present a discussion of the theoretical framework that illustrates a great variety of defining the concept of technological entrepreneurship in the management science literature. The empirical research aims at evaluation of critical factors supporting the creation and development of academic start-ups as well as obstacles to setting up academic ventures. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper draws on a broad literature review, covering various approaches to the concept of technological entrepreneurship. The author tries to critically analyze and synthesize the views of scholars on this phenomenon using the following methods: exploration, interpretation, comparing, analysing features, and inferring. The empirical research applies the method of in-depth structured direct interviews with experts in the field of commercialization and technology transfer, academic entrepreneurship, and start-up incubation. Both descriptive and explanatory techniques were used in the presented study. Findings: The research findings provide insightful guidance for the ways of supporting start-ups with academic origin and for more effective business-science cooperation. The current reflections on the concept of technological entrepreneurship in management sciences confirm the multidimensionality of the phenomenon and two main research lines, namely one focused on technological innovations created and implemented mainly by high-tech enterprises, and the other one on academic entrepreneurship and the intellectual potential of universities and R&D institutes for commercialization of research findings leading to development of innovative products and services. Practical Implications: The synthesis of the current reflections on the concept of technological entrepreneurship and the research findings reflected here can benefit both entrepreneurship teachers' practice at HEIs, researchers, and employees of business incubators as a source for further analysis and the relevance of the methods used. Originality/Value: The originality of the conducted exploratory research lies in presenting the factors supporting operations of academic start-ups diagnosed by the author and their evaluation by experts with many years of experience in the field of business-science collaboration. Moreover, the paper provides an integrated research framework that build on and add value to the previous research on technological entrepreneurship in management sciences.

T1  - Exploring Strategies for Developing Entrepreneurial Behavior of Students in Romanian Universities
AN  - 2628335308
AB  - Throughout this research paper we want to emphasize the correlations of theory and practice regarding the topic of the entrepreneurial university. The research combines a two-level approach by correlating both a qualitative-bibliometric analysis and a quantitative exploratory analysis. To identify the theoretical descriptors of the "entrepreneurial university" concept we performed a cluster analysis by using VOSviewer software selecting the published articles in the Scopus database since its beginning. The relevance of this analysis consists in the opportunity of extracting the most relevant information on the analyzed topic according to several criteria such as keywords, co-occurrence, co-citation, or publication topics by year. From this perspective the pieces of evidence are meaningful and we shall present them within the sections of the paper. On the other hand, for obtaining a practice grounded perspective, we applied 350 questionnaires to a target group involved in a university grant for young entrepreneurs. The purpose of the survey was to determine a series of characteristics and patterns of behavior of respondents related to their entrepreneurial orientation. The questionnaire contained a large number of variables for each individual to identify his/her distinct options and thus to draw the big picture. The variables were grouped into 6 dimensions which we identified as a priority for the entrepreneurial orientation framework: personal traits, motivation, attitude, framework conditions, and skills and knowledge. We statistically processed the survey data to identify the most meaningful correlations and interdependencies between the variables. The results of both research protocols are correlated and argued within the final section of the paper followed by conclusions and further research tracks.

T1  - Discussing the Role of Entrepreneurial Universities in COVID-19 Era in the Middle East
AN  - 2578015914
AB  - Research Question: This conceptual research explores the role that academic entrepreneurship can play in Middle Eastern countries in addressing the effects of COVID-19 pandemic in the region. Motivation: Entrepreneurial universities are pivotal in contemporary economic systems due to their significant contributions in innovation efforts. Part of their mission is seen in the commercialization of their scientific knowledge through the creation of spin-offs (Cvijic et al., 2019; O'shea et al., 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2019). The challenges and constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the importance of coordinating the efforts of all parties including those of entrepreneurial universities in order to develop vaccines and generate healthcare solutions which could be patented and commercialized afterwards. Hence, this paper identifies the factors which can reinforce the entrepreneurial insertion of universities and increase their capacity in supporting collective efforts aiming at combatting the COVID-19 aftermath. Idea: Based on a review of recent literature, the purpose of this conceptual study is twofold: identify the predictors and the success factors of academic entrepreneurship; and argue for research propositions that could guide future empirical research. In addition, this paper provides insights into the current evolution of the entrepreneurial experiences of Middle Eastern universities. Data: This explorative research was based on an extensive literature review of the core aspects relevant to academic entrepreneurship. Recent references published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals with the primary focus on the Middle East or other developing economies were targeted in order to build up the conceptual model revolving around nine research propositions. Tools: Selected references were reviewed and categorized around the mainstream themes identified by the authors, i.e., impact of entrepreneurial universities, antecedents of academic entrepreneurship, and its success factors. For each block, several research propositions were derived and presented. Findings: The literature review findings argue for the potential role that specific factors can play in promoting the entrepreneurial engagement of Middle Eastern universities, namely the national institutional framework, an easy access to funding sources, the existence of interrelations with local organizations and the quality of the university’s organizational infrastructure. The conceptual framework assumes also that the performance of entrepreneurial universities would depend on the number and quality of relationships with the industry, the support of venture capitalists and the intensity of their entrepreneurial and market orientations. Contribution: This research contributes essentially in underlining the growing importance of academic entrepreneurship and how it can be a rewarding choice for Middle Eastern policy makers.

T1  - Socioeconomic Impacts of University–Industry Collaborations–A Systematic Review and Conceptual Model
AN  - 2576663064
AB  - University–industry collaborations create socioeconomic impacts for the areas where they are undertaken. Although these collaborations have recognized importance and a high potential to generate economic and social benefits, there is no consensus in the literature on a consolidated conceptual model for assessing their socioeconomic impacts. Given this scenario, this study reviews 94 studies on the socioeconomic impact of university–industry collaborations using a context–intervention–mechanism–outcomes configuration. The impacts identified in the systematic literature review are classified into: (1) economic, (2) social, and (3) financial. The systematic literature review also indicates that the impact of collaborations can change the context and enhance the mechanisms of technology transfer. From a theoretical viewpoint, this work contributes to the structuring of a conceptual model for assessing the socioeconomic impacts of university–industry collaborations. In addition, the results have contributions for management in each strand of the triple helix: they may be useful to guide universities and companies on how to assess the socioeconomic impacts of each collaboration, direct public agents in the evaluation of results of investments, and support the development of policies for innovation and technology management.

T1  - Institutional theory and IFRS: an agenda for future research
TT  - Teoría institucional y NIIF: una agenda para futuras investigaciones
AN  - 2544482885
AB  - This paper highlights the capacity for Institutional Theory [IT] to render in-depth understanding of change processes associated with the adoption and implementation of international accounting standards by countries and organisations. Although the fact of requiring the adoption of IFRS could be characterised as a form of coercive power, recent developments in IT help to explore the extent to which adoption and diffusion of IFRS is shaped by agency, the interests of actors involved in the adoption process, and the role of institutional entrepreneurs and institutional work. We provide a structured review of literature that uses an IT framework in the context of adopting and implementing IFRS. The review brings together various streams of IT and current debates in the management and organisation literature. This allows us to outline an agenda for future research that proposes six new research questions for investigation. These research questions are intended to encourage greater regard for the capacity of the theoretical toolkit of institutional logics to explore institutional entrepreneurship, institutional work, and the institutional dynamics of change processes associated with the adoption, maintenance and disruption of accounting systems.Alternate abstract:Este articulo destaca la capacidad de la Teoría Institucional [TI] para proporcionar una profunda comprensión de los procesos de cambio asociados a la adopción e implementación de las normas internacionales de información financiera (NIIF) por parte de los países y organizaciones. Aunque el hecho de exigir la adopción de las NIIF podría caracterizarse como una forma de poder coercitivo, los desarrollos recientes en la TI ayudan a explorar hasta qué punto la adopción y difusión de las NIIF es moldeada por la agencia, los intereses de los actores involucrados en el proceso de adopción, y el papel de los emprendedores institucionales y del trabajo institucional. Proporcionamos una revisión estructurada de la literatura que utiliza como marco teórico la TI en el contexto de la adopción e implementación de las NIIF. La revisión de la literatura reúne varias corrientes de la TI y debates actuales en la literatura de gestión y organización. Esto nos permite esbozar una agenda para futuras investigaciones que propone seis nuevas preguntas de investigación. Estas preguntas de investigación tienen como objetivo fomentar una mayor consideración de la capacidad del conjunto de herramientas teóricas de la lógica institucional para explorar el emprendimiento institucional, el trabajo institucional y la dinámica institucional de los procesos de cambio asociados con la adopción, el mantenimiento y la ruptura de los sistemas de contabilidad.

T1  - The interaction between knowledge management and technology transfer: a current literature review between 2013 and 2018
AN  - 2442437756
AB  - The underlying challenges of knowledge management and technology transfer and their respective contributions to the development of society are well-known and widely discussed issues in business management. This paper aims to (1) build on the state-of-the art literature on knowledge management and technology transfer, (2) to identify the most relevant, recent studies, and main researchers working on the field worldwide, and (3) to unveil topics of recent development in the field, as well as overlap the themes. To this end, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and Scopus databases were screened for studies that explored the relevance of knowledge management and technology transfer. This research focused on the most recent studies comprising the periods of 2013–2018, while employing Metodi Ordinatio as a quality ranking method, producing thus 50 studies submitted for further analysis and appraisal. The study sought to analyze the co-occurrence of keywords on the theme, the number of citations, number of publications per country, year and journal, and the overlap between areas. This paper also enabled an analysis of the steps required for knowledge management and their relationship to technology transfer. The results showed that most studies focused on the private sector and on technology transfer for attaining innovation, customer orientation and acquiring technological abilities. The university–industry relationship was also observed, in which the focus is on universities creating and transferring knowledge in order to foment the economic and technological power of industries. The findings can assist public and private companies, non-governmental organizations, university and industry applications in terms of knowledge management and technology transfer.

T1  - Digital Academic Entrepreneurship: A structured literature review and avenue for a research agenda
AN  - 2438723805
AB  - This paper reviews the Academic Entrepreneurship literature according to the emergence of powerful Digital technologies, providing an overview of the state of research and outlining a future research agenda about Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. One hundred and sixty-five journal papers were initially extracted from Scopus and their content was analysed for the paper selection process by two researchers in parallel, plus a third one in case of uncertainty. Finally, fifty-nine papers dealing with digital academic entrepreneurship and published in a variety of academic journals have been analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis. Findings show that literature on Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is really scant and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis provides the emergence of four major research streams: 1) Digital Technologies for Entrepreneurship Education; 2) The "maker space movement" for Academic Entrepreneurship; 3) Digital technologies for discovering entrepreneurial opportunities; 4) Creating entrepreneurial competences in the Digital "University-based" Entrepreneurial ecosystems. The paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive structured literature review of the disruptive role of digital transformation for the Academic Entrepreneurship. Despite the growing literature on Digital Entrepreneurship, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized. More systematic and holistic studies, considering both the technological, economic and the social aspects of Academic Entrepreneurship are required.

T1  - Academic entrepreneurship intentions: a systematic literature review
TT  - Academic entrepreneurship intentions
AN  - 2461406192
AB  - PurposeThe objective of this research is to have an up-to-date and comprehensive assessment of the current knowledge regarding the variables that encourage the individuals, within the academic community, to get involved in knowledge exploitation activities. It is influenced by the observation that there is a need for more systematic scrutiny of micro-level processes to deepen our understanding of academic entrepreneurship (Balven et al., 2018; Wright and Phan, 2018). The study proposes to answer to ‘What are the drivers of academic entrepreneurial intentions?’ and ‘What are the emerging topics for future research?’Design/methodology/approachThe paper follows a Systematic Literature Review process (Tranfield et al., 2003) and adopts a four-step process format from previous literature reviews within the entrepreneurship context (Miller et al., 2018). From the results within Scopus and Web of Science databases, this research selected, evaluated, summarised and synthesised 66 relevant papers.FindingsThis study provides a factor-listed representation of the individual, organisational and institutional variables that should be considered in the strategies defined by the university. Moreover, the study concludes that the push factors behind the intentions are multiple, context-dependent, hierarchy-dependent, heterogeneous and, at the same time, dependent on each other and against each other. Lastly, the study contributes to academic entrepreneurship literature, especially entrepreneurial intention literature, which has recently received more researchers' attention.Originality/valueThe study corroborates that the individual factors, directly and indirectly via Theory of Planned Behaviour, strongly impact the academics' intentions. While the focus of the papers under review was an in-depth analysis of a selected group of factors, this SLR sought to compile the factors that were identified and provide a broader picture of all those factors to be considered by the university management. It contributes to the identification and clustering of the drivers that encourage academics to engage in knowledge valorisation activities, differentiating them by activity. For the practitioners, this list can be used by university managers, TTOs and department managers, and policymakers to guide questionnaires or interviews to analyse their academics' intentions and adequately support its academic engagement strategy. Lastly, this study also suggests worthwhile avenues for future research.

T1  - Development of research on the university entrepreneurship ecosystem: trends and areas of interest of researchers based on a systematic review of literature
AN  - 2399206761
AB  - Research background: The concept of the university entrepreneurship ecosystem is nowadays a part of the current trends in researching the determinants of support for commercialization of research results. The subject is relatively new, because the first papers in this topic are dated to 2009, and in fact it has only been in the last 3 years that the interest of researchers in this subject has increased. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this study is to analyze the state of research on the issue of the university ecosystem of academic entrepreneurship and to identify the main research trends related to this topic. Methods: The article was based on a systematic review of the literature (SLR), which included the selection of basic literature and selection of publications, mayor researchers, bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Findings & Value added: The results of the conducted research indicate that the study of the university ecosystem of academic entrepreneurship is still a new issue, poorly recognized in literature, without a solid methodological foundation and which may constitute a current and interesting research area. Our paper adds to existing research in four important ways. We provide a holistic review of university entrepreneurial ecosystem. We also identify the challenges identified in this area and suggest how they may be developed. Third, our results are also policyrelevant. For policy-makers, it is important to know whether academic engagement is driven by mechanisms existing in academic ecosystem or affected by factors that may not be activated by it.

T1  - A readiness framework to evaluate local economy for an entrepreneurial university
TT  - Entrepreneurial university
AN  - 2533607914
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for the transformation from a second-generation university to an entrepreneurial university. The work is practical and innovative, which provides the foundation for further work in this field.Design/methodology/approachBased on a systematic review of relevant studies on entrepreneurial universities, this paper proposed an evaluation framework with clear logic and practicability. This paper also provided a basis for further research. The restrictions of each factor were defined by the readiness framework, and the consequences of entrepreneurial activities on local economic development were analyzed by using the proposed model. The proposed conceptual framework aided policymakers in completing a much-needed assessment of the impact of organizational policies, practices and structures on the entrepreneurial activities and transformation from second-generation universities to third-generation organizations.FindingsThe proposed readiness framework led to the development of organizational interventions that facilitated successful entrepreneurial activities. The quantitative indicators of different university types were demonstrated in this study. The quantitative validation of the integrated framework suggested that university heads and policymakers can encourage and develop academic entrepreneurship by using a comprehensive systems approach for the identification, protection and commercialization of university’s intellectual property.Originality/valueThis paper provides a framework for policymakers or decision makers to better understand whether a local university is ready for entrepreneurship. This framework also provides a direction for future quantitative research.

T1  - A framework to improve university–industry collaboration
TT  - University–industry collaboration
AN  - 2506877030
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to improve the effectiveness of university–industry collaboration (UIC). This work enhances the existing body of literature and knowledge regarding collaboration and offers concrete steps to be taken for effective collaboration between universities and industries.Research MethodologyA literature review to study the best practices, impediments to collaboration and the various models proposed in the past for successful UIC was conducted. A workshop and focus-group meetings of practitioners and academic researchers was designed and organised to explore the current state of the university–industry engagement within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region and gather inputs regarding possible approaches to improve collaboration. The findings from the literature review and the results from this qualitative research regarding the approaches to improve the effectiveness of the collaboration were analysed.Results and implicationsThe study discovers that various measures have been proposed in the form of best practices or models to improve the effectiveness of UIC. However, these measures often address a specific concern such as technology transfer, intellectual property (IP), etc. There is a scope for a comprehensive holistic framework to address many aspects of UIC in order to improve effectiveness and achieve success. A framework for improving the effectiveness of collaboration considering a comprehensive list of factors operating in a broad context within the collaboration system was proposed.Originality/valueThe framework builds on previous literature dealing with measures for successful UIC. However, it is the first of its kind, in the researcher's knowledge, in terms of comprehensiveness of the factors contributing to establishing and sustaining successful collaboration. The value of the individual experience of the participants in this qualitative research, which is on average more than 10 years in the software engineering field, validates the importance and quality of the data collected. The addition of these results to the framework increases its validity.The framework can be utilised by universities and industry practitioners to foster successful and effective collaboration. The results have significant relevance, particularly within the Australian context as the government has intensified the adoption of measures to encourage and improve collaboration between universities and the industry.

T1  - Quality management of higher education: Innovation approach from perspectives of institutionalism. An exploratory literature review
AN  - 2485460351
AB  - External pressures, like political, economic and technological factors, as well as competition at labour and education markets have challenged higher education institutions to reconsider their organizational structures and internal management approach to provide better quality education, to attract more potential stakeholders, as well as to sustain their positions at local and global markets. The responsiveness of universities to such pressures and uncertainties is diverse. There are dozens of research identifying current best quality management practices. However, this paper makes an emphasis on the analysis of one of the streams of economic science—institutionalism as an innovative approach to effective internal management in HEIs. Institutionalism is a direction in economic thought that places the main emphasis on the analysis of institutions, which is defined as norms, restrictions and principles of behaviour (“rules of the game”) within an organization. In general, institutionalism is so diverse that its study as a whole is almost meaningless because there are different trends in institutionalism itself. Some prefer isomorphic elements of new institutionalism, whereas other stress on processes of differentiation between universities. Nevertheless, despite a growing tendency of an isomorphic strategy of successful universities and effective organizational strategies, there is a lack of research conducted on the application of elements of institutionalism in higher education, as a successful approach to effective internal quality management. The central idea of this paper is to analyze the existing body of literature related to the application of institutionalism in higher education through systematic literature review.

T1  - Knowledge Based View of University Tech Transfer—A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2440401360
AB  - Research and technology commercialization at research-intensive universities has helped to develop provincial economies resulting in university startups, the growth of other new companies and associated employment. University technology transfer offices (TTOs) oversee the process of technology transfer into the commercial marketplace and these organizational units can be considered in the context of enabling effective knowledge management. However, what enables productive TTO performance has not been comprehensively researched. Therefore, this research study adopted the knowledge-based view as the theoretical construct to support a comprehensive investigation into this area. This was achieved through employing a systematic literature review (SLR) combined with a robust meta-analysis. The SLR identified an initial total of 10,126 articles in the first step of the review process, with 44 studies included in the quantitative synthesis, and 29 quantitative empirical studies selected for the meta-analysis. The research study identified that the relationship between TTO knowledge management and knowledge deployment as well as startup business performance is where TTOs secure the strongest returns.

T1  - Knowledge management in entrepreneurial universities: A structured literature review and avenue for future research agenda
TT  - Knowledge management
AN  - 2316760552
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to review and critique the knowledge management (KM) literature within Entrepreneurial universities, providing an overview of the state of research and outlining a future research agenda.Design/methodology/approachIn a systematic literature review, 1106 articles indexed at Scopus were initially submitted to a bibliometric analysis. Finally, 150 papers published in a variety of academic journals specializing in the field of Entrepreneurship, KM and Higher Education were analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis to minimize mistakes in interpreting findings of collected studies.FindingsKM within entrepreneurial university is a research area of growing importance. Findings show that literature on KM models and tools in the entrepreneurial university is fragmented and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis shows heterogeneous literature, but four major research streams emerge: knowledge transfer in university–industry collaboration; knowledge creation in entrepreneurship education; KM processes for university spin-offs; entrepreneurial university to support knowledge-based regional development. The results show a failure to address the implications of findings for policy makers, which risks making KM in entrepreneurial universities research irrelevant.Research limitations/implicationsAlthough different structured literature reviews (SLRs) exist separately in the field of KM and entrepreneurial universities, to the authors’ best knowledge, no studies exist in the intersection between the two fields.Originality/valueThe paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive SLR of the articles dealing with models and processes of KM in the entrepreneurial university. Despite the increasing literature, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized, thus requiring more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the economic and the social aspects of KM within universities. The paper’s findings can offer insights into future research avenues.

T1  - The development, growth, and performance of university spin-offs: a critical review
AN  - 2164400654
AB  - The literature examining university spin-offs is expanding rapidly. While most studies have examined the antecedents of spin-off creation at universities, the impact of spin-offs commercializing university research cannot be properly assessed without considering how these firms develop, grow, and perform over time. This study provides a systematic review of a recent research stream addressing the development, growth, and performance of university spin-offs. By critically analyzing 105 research papers published since 2000, this paper makes two main contributions. First, we present a conceptual framework outlining the variety of outcomes used in the literature to assess the development, growth and performance of university spin-offs, as well as the determinants of these outcomes at different levels of analysis. Second, we critically assess gaps in the extant literature and discuss promising directions for future research. We conclude that the university spin-off phenomenon provides an excellent empirical context for conducting research that contributes to more general theoretical discussions related to entrepreneurship, innovation and management.

T1  - A critical review of the academic entrepreneurial ecosystem in developing countries: The case of Algeria
AN  - 2341367874
AB  - The objective of this article is to conduct a critical review of the literature related to the academic entrepreneurial ecosystems in developing countries in order to highlight the perspectives and to raise new questions in this area of research in these countries. The first part of this study examines the entrepreneurial context and innovation systems to determine the socio-economic and political factors that can have a negative influence on the emergence of an effective academic entrepreneurship in emerging economies. The second part explores the phenomenon of the academic entrepreneurial ecosystem in Algeria to identify the main issues and challenges that may have to be taken into consideration while promoting academic entrepreneurship in Algeria. In this study, we focus on the experience of the pharmaceutical industry as a successful model to develop effective approaches for commercializing the results of the academic research. The article also attempts to define the roles of three main actors, namely, the state, academic institutions and industry.

T1  - The interplay of external ties and internal knowledge base: Implications for radical innovation in China’s university spin-offs
AN  - 2322619455
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between two types of informal ties and radical innovation in the context of China’s university spin-offs and the moderating roles of knowledge breadth and depth in such relationships.Design/methodology/approachA systematic review of literature on informal ties, internal knowledge base and radical innovation provides the theoretical foundation of the research framework and hypotheses. Using a sample of 158 China’s university spin-offs, the authors conduct a regression analysis on the theoretical framework and hypotheses.FindingsThe results show that business and university ties are positively related to radical innovation. Moreover, the effects of business and university ties on radical innovation are contingent on knowledge breadth and depth in opposite ways. In particular, the positive effect of business ties on radical innovation depends significantly on internal knowledge depth rather than on knowledge breadth, and the positive effect of university ties on radical innovation will be affected by internal knowledge breadth rather than knowledge depth.Practical implicationsManagers of university spin-offs must examine informal ties they already have and identify their nature, content and embedded advantages and promptly adjust their strategy of informal ties to adapt to their firms’ internal knowledge base.Originality/valueThis study highlights the positive role of managers’ personal connections with different external parties in facilitating radical innovation and advances the understanding of informal ties by proposing that the effects of informal ties on radical innovation are contingent on a firm’s internal knowledge base in the context of China’s university spin-offs.

T1  - Digital academic entrepreneurship: The potential of digital technologies on academic entrepreneurship
AN  - 2287469630
AB  - Today's digital technologies, such as social media, business analytics, the Internet of Things, big data, advanced manufacturing, 3D printing, cloud and cyber-solutions and MOOCs, permeate every private and public organization. However, even if this phenomenon has been analyzed for entrepreneurship in general, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of digital technologies on academic entrepreneurship remains not only slightly addressed. With the aim of filling this gap, this paper proposes a novel contribution regarding the emerging concept of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. Based on a qualitative literature review, an interpretative framework for Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is deductively proposed that is composed of the following components: the rationale for the adoption of digital technologies for academic entrepreneurship (why), the emerging forms of digital academic entrepreneurship (what), the stakeholders involved through the digital technologies to achieve the academic entrepreneurship goal (who), and the processes of academic entrepreneurship supported by digital technologies (how). The discussion section provides a conceptualization of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. The paper closes with the identification of a research agenda for this promising and under-researched field.

T1  - Exploration and exploitation in the development of more entrepreneurial universities: A twisting learning path model of ambidexterity
AN  - 2210877624
AB  - The paper conducts a systematic literature review on the development process of universities towards the entrepreneurial model to provide a conceptual framework and a strategic research agenda. From the analysis of the body of literature on the topic, exploration and exploitation emerge as critical processes in the development of entrepreneurial universities. Nevertheless, the way they are balanced within universities is an under-researched topic. Adapted from the concept of organisational ambidexterity, this paper develops the notion of university ambidexterity to analyse the development process of entrepreneurial universities. To achieve this research aim, a conceptual model is developed by integrating the learning processes of exploration and exploitation to the previous theories used to analyse the entrepreneurial university. As already emphasised in other studies focusing on the role of ambidexterity in different research contexts, this paper proposes an idea of balance over time. The universities need to balance exploration and exploitation in their evolutionary path towards the entrepreneurial model, but it may be not necessary to invest in exploration and exploitation processes simultaneously. On the contrary, it may be most important to oscillate between periods of exploration and periods of exploitation to achieve ambidexterity over time. As a result, the tensions between exploration and exploitation processes generate a twisting learning path for entrepreneurial universities. Finally, the paper proposes an integrated conceptual framework which consists of six constructs, namely internal organisational environment, external environment, university exploration, university exploitation, university ambidexterity, entrepreneurial university performance. The proposed research hypotheses on the interrelationships between the mentioned constructs and the mediating role of university ambidexterity constitute potential areas of investigation to direct future empirical research and further develop the body of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurial universities.

T1  - Significance and Role of Entrepreneurial University in Emerging Economies
AN  - 2904648882
AB  - Universities have been among the oldest organizations who have stood unchanged until the advent of globalization, the information explosion, and the convergence of information, technology, and communication. However, today as it stands, universities the world over are in a dynamic state and they are forced to transform to meet the ever-changing needs of development and growth. This is due in part from educating the next generation who can make their place and compete in the globalized world. Thus, universities in emerging economies are now moving towards becoming ‘entrepreneurial universities' to meet the changing demand and challenges. Thus, by adopting a qualitative approach with an in-depth literature review, the aim of this paper, to understand the need, role, and significance of the entrepreneurial university, and provide a holistic framework for an entrepreneurial university and to identify the critical success factors that make a university truly entrepreneurial in the context of emerging economies.

T1  - Creating Value in the Entrepreneurial University: Marketization and Merchandising Strategies
AN  - 2545564347
AB  - Higher education institutions are called to expand their role and responsibilities, by enhancing their entrepreneurial mindset and redefining relationships with stakeholders. In order to cope with these new challenges, they have started to operate in a strategic manner, by performing marketing and merchandising activities. Indeed, in a sector characterized by the presence of competitive funding models, several forms of accountability, and performance indicators, universities have become open systems and have started to operate like enterprises, considering students as customers. Given this premise, the aim of the paper is to individuate marketing and merchandising strategies in higher education and to evaluate their effectiveness in order to foster stakeholders engagement. This is in line with the entrepreneurial university model that represents the starting point of the theoretical study, then a literature review of “marketization” in higher education institutions is presented, showing how this field is not yet completely investigated. Data refer to the Italian context and are analyzed through a qualitative method. Findings suggest that most Italian universities perform merchandising strategies, but currently there is not sufficient information to evaluate their effectiveness in higher education, it was only possible to make hypotheses.

T1  - Models, Processes, and Roles of Universities in Technology Transfer Management: A Systematic Review
AN  - 2545535905
AB  - Universities play pivotal roles when research findings are to be adopted commercially. Although these roles vary from one country to another, effective patenting and licensing procedures, as well as eventual commercialisation of scholarly inventions, reflect hard work on the part of the University mediating between the researcher and the industry through technology transfer offices (TTOs) in order to ensure that knowledge-developers take motivational and monetary credit for their findings. This paper details some existing models, processes, and roles taken up in some countries where sharing of intellectual property exists, and links it up with aspects of university–industry technology transfer, such as policies surrounding patenting, government investment and marketing, and the process of academic entrepreneurship, among others. 22 articles were found via a systematic review of literature and analysed with respect to four identified areas of focus: internal strategy, investment and market, academic entrepreneurship and policy. Based on models, processes, and roles in reviewed studies, our results indicate that new models for technology transfer mainly stem from the fact that there is no universally accepted model in the literature. Furthermore, management of technology transfer is mostly the responsibility of TTOs in most countries. While university TTOs act as intermediaries to protect the interest of the author/inventor, issues such as poor relationships between universities and industry, as well as funding, remain major challenges in many emerging economies. In contrast, researchers in western economies are mainly challenged by financial motivation and recognition within the academic domains.

T1  - Corporate entrepreneurship as a strategic approach for internal innovation performance
AN  - 2506855761
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore corporate entrepreneurship and the relationship between intrapreneurship and the proposed strategic models through a literature review. This paper reviews the strategic approach for increasing internal innovation performance at corporations.Design/methodology/approachKey words were identified to use in the literature search: corporate entrepreneurship, innovation performance and entrepreneurial environment. Then, all of the several electronic databases available in the university’s electronic library, including Harvard Business Review and The University of Chicago Press, as well as journals, books, Google Scholar and other institutional resources.FindingsThe six innovative outcomes are motivating individuals to engage in innovative behavior, concentrating entrepreneurial ventures through a newly minted organization within a corporation, helping innovative-minded people to reach their full potential, rewarding a corporate entrepreneur, encouraging people to look at the organization from a broad perspective and educating employees about corporate entrepreneurship.Research limitations/implicationsThe study was exploratory, based on a literature review. Further studies are needed using empirical research to examine why corporate entrepreneurship was attributed to be the strategic approach for internal innovation performance.Practical implicationsBy implementing the strategic approaches, corporate management professionals can realize their entrepreneurial intentions for the firm and maintain their responsibility to shareholders in terms of other business and development goals.Originality/valueThe research constructs an input-process-output framework that minimizes external mergers and acquisitions and maximizes internal innovation performance. Value was created when corporate entrepreneurship was identified as a strategic approach for internal innovation performance.

T1  - Knowledge management, knowledge transfer and organizational performance in the arts and crafts industry: a literature review
AN  - 2067093492
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive academic literature review on the relationship between knowledge management, knowledge transfer and organizational performance in a specific subset of the creative industry, i.e. arts and crafts organizations. Furthermore, this paper analyzes how knowledge management and transfer within arts and crafts organizations help increase performance and enhance the value of the activity of the so-called “knowledge workers” (i.e. craftsmen), who are the real knowledge owners in the process of value creation.Design/methodology/approachThe literature review follows the model suggested by Vom Brocke et al. (2009). The review follows a five-phase approach so as to be systematic, transparent and replicable. Academic contributions published over two periods are taken into consideration. The first period covers the years 1990-2000, when the concepts of creative industry and knowledge-based economy were developed. The second period covers the years 2000-2016, when scholars started to investigate how to effectively transfer knowledge (very often in the form of “tacit knowledge”) retained by master craftsmen in arts and crafts organizations and the critical role played by craftsmen in the performance of such organizations.FindingsThree main issues have emerged: how arts and crafts organizations manage and transfer knowledge internally; the effects of these activities on organizational performance; and the prominent role of craftsmen. The literature review shows how in arts and crafts organizations there is a considerable link between the concepts of “performance" and "tacit knowledge", even though addressing such link is somehow hard to realize, for several reasons discussed in the paper. The measurement of performance in arts and crafts organizations has become an area of academic investigation only when both the role of knowledge management and transfer and the role of knowledge workers (i.e., craftsmen) have become evident for obtaining a competitive advantage.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper has been an attempt to organize existing studies on knowledge management and transfer and to investigate the relationship existing between knowledge and performance in arts and crafts organizations. Nevertheless, the relationship between knowledge and performance is yet to be explored, as well as the development of techniques for measuring arts and crafts organizations’ performance effectively. The present contribution calls for a systematic reflection on how the transfer of traditional craftsmen’s skills impacts organizational performances in the long run. The definition and implementation of new performance evaluations criteria tailored to enhance the tacit knowledge of craftsmen as a real source of differentiation and competitive advantage for the arts and crafts organizations is somehow still missing.Practical implicationsBy pursuing its objectives, the present contribution aims to represent a step toward enabling arts and crafts organizations to play a vital role in the modern society in a more structured way. This would help to build awareness of the potential of arts and crafts organizations for promoting economic growth, proposing a value proposition different from the one dictated by the globalization and by the triumph of product standardization and mass production.Originality/valueAnalyzing the knowledge management and transfer within arts and crafts organizations with a historical perspective, it appears that the recognition in academic literature of the centrality of knowledge management and transfer within arts and crafts organizations is only recent (i.e. from 2011 onward). Indeed, for approximately 20 years (i.e. 1990-2010), knowledge has been constantly related to technological paradigms and standardized results, with very little research and debate on craftsmanship and the role of craftsmen. Nevertheless, the research shows that over the years, the focus on knowledge in arts and crafts organizations and knowledge transfer has become progressively more detailed and precise: some authors have studied the role of craftsmen in the knowledge economy according to a historical perspective, while some others have analyzed different types of knowledge more thoroughly. For example, Sveiby (1997, 1996), analyzing the concept of "knowing talent" and "tradition", outlines a more prominent role of craftsmen in the knowledge economy and explain how, in sectors with a strong traditional background, the transfer of tacit knowledge is a meaningful challenge for many organizations.

T1  - Profile of academic entrepreneurship in Brazil: Evidence from the evaluation of former holders of undergraduate research, master and PhD scholarships
AN  - 2506869054
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to understand, in the state of São Paulo academic environment, the differences between the profiles of academic entrepreneurs, nonacademic entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected data from a more comprehensive research, whose objective was to evaluate the scholarship programmes of São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). For data collection, the authors used an online questionnaire, pre-filled with information from the Lattes Curriculum of the sample individuals, as well as information obtained from FAPESP and from coordination for the improvement of higher education personnel. The response rate of the questionnaires was 21 per cent. The authors sought to explore the variables regarding entrepreneurial activities carried out by former scholarship holders, by relating them to other key variables identified in the literature review and explained in the hypotheses.FindingsThe results indicate that entrepreneurship rates decrease with the higher academic level of the researcher; in general, academic entrepreneurs come from families with a good financial situation, and applied sciences are the areas of knowledge with more entrepreneurs.Originality/valueDespite the great number of theoretical and empirical studies found in the literature on entrepreneurship and academic entrepreneurship, there is still a shortage of practical studies on this latter topic in Brazil. This gap is even more evident when the authors consider the significant growth of entrepreneurial activity in the country in the past years. This paper contributes to fill this gap, and it aims to understand, in the state of São Paulo academic environment, the differences between the profiles of academic entrepreneurs, nonacademic entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs.

T1  - Public policy for academic entrepreneurship initiatives: a review and critical discussion
AN  - 2099312807
AB  - This article provides a critical review and discussion of current literature on technology transfer, incubators, and academic entrepreneurship. Drawing upon the notion of robustness in social systems and public choice theory, we review, code, and taxonomize 166 studies to assess the likelihood that these initiatives will generate innovation and economic growth. We find that academic entrepreneurship initiatives are characterized by conflicting goals, weak incentive structures for universities and academics, and are contextually dependent upon factors such as university strength. Our results suggest that there are critical boundary conditions that are unlikely to be fulfilled when universities and policymakers enact policies to support academic entrepreneurship initiatives. Policymakers therefore need to be cautious in the potential design of such initiatives. We discuss how technology transfer from universities might be better achieved through alternative mechanisms such as contract research, licensing, consulting and increased labor mobility among researchers.

T1  - University-industry linkage and technology transfer management: A quantitative study of an entrepreneurial university
TT  - Technology transfer management
AN  - 2108079892
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the variables that play a relevant role in the management of university-industry linkage and technology transfer in the context of a public university in Mexico.Design/methodology/approachThis study is quantitative, and the method is based on an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), to identify the group of variables that relates to university-industry technology transfer, by applying a questionnaire to full time professors and researchers.FindingsThe EFA allowed for the analysis of the relationships within a group of variables, and found that the structure of the principal components presents a close connection to the literature review. The first, second and third factors, named institutional support in the linkage and technology transfer activities, research results management, and university linkage activities planning, respectively, explain the original problem in a greater percentage. Additionally, it is suggested to include other variables, to increase the explained variance percentage of the components.Social implicationsThe study of university-industry linkage and technology transfer allows for improvement in the institutional management of these activities, their entrepreneurship, and consequently, their use by companies, government and society.Originality/valueThis study focuses on analyzing a group of variables in a questionnaire, in order to identify those that are related to the university-industry technology transfer management, in the context of a public university in Mexico.

T1  - Domains and Trends of Entrepreneurship Research
AN  - 2089841434
AB  - The Schumpeterian model emphases entrepreneurship as the central axis of economic growth. Growth in the managed economy comes from stability, specialization, and scale, but in the entrepreneurial economy, growth comes from entrepreneurship based on flexibility, creativity and connectivity. So, it is necessary to monitor entrepreneurship more academically. This study analyzed the articles related to entrepreneurship provided by the Web of Science. The representative bibliometric analysis of entrepreneurship were Meyer et al.(2014) and Teixeira(201l). Using this methodology as references, the Database was established. The analysis targets are 15,284 articles. Domain of entrepreneurship research consists of ?'? entrepreneurship by target, social institutional entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship intention, corporate governance, technology-based entrepreneurship, firm, performance and entrepreneurial orientation, and global entrepreneurship. We analyzed emergence of entrepreneurship research in 2002~2017, but articles not cited in the WOS DB and published before 2002 were not considered.

T1  - INSIGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES FROM A LITERATURE REVIEW ON UNIVERSITY SPIN-OFFS
AN  - 2059077646
AB  - The need for innovation and the ability to transfer knowledge to society and industry are essential for the development of current economy. In this sense, universities play a crucial role in this mission, and university spin-offs have become one of the most popular mechanisms of academic knowledge transfer. The purpose of this paper is to perform a literature review in the field of university spin-offs. The adopted methodology starts by creating a conceptual map of the various research areas around university spin-offs, followed by the identification of the most predominant studies in the field taking into account the number of citations. The findings indicate that the main explored dimensions in the university spin-offs research include the process of technology transfer, the role of university in the society, the regional context of the university and the impact of university spin-offs considering several dimensions. On the other side the least explored dimensions include the analysis of the founders' background, and the establishment of public policies to support the activities of university spin-offs.

T1  - Balanced Scorecard in Universities
AN  - 3156319061
AB  - Objective: Performance measurement and reporting leading to greater transparency and accountability of universities have become a challenging issue. Increasingly, universities have been required to provide performance indicators—empirical evidence of their value creation — to the different group of stakeholders. One of the approaches that may be applied by universities is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The objective of this paper is to indicate the BSC as a useful tool for the evaluation of the universities’ performance.Methodology: This study is based on the following research methods: descriptive, deductive, and the literature review. It refers also to case studies that are quoted in the context of their practical BSC application experience and it presents the pioneer approach of California University in BSC adoption. The rationale of this paper follows the principal-agent theory that is a foundation of the accountability concept. It refers also to the new managerialism, new public management, and entrepreneurial university.Findings: Based on the literature review concerning the analysis of the examples of universities implementing BSC, this paper argues that BSC provides a framework for the performance measurement that allows for the increased transparency and accountability of these institutions.Value added: The pioneer BSC framework presented in this paper can be used as the basis for the development of general performance measurement in universities.Recommendations: It is recommended that the universities that want to boost their transparency and be accountable for their outcomes apply and develop the BSC framework to which we refer to in this paper.

T1  - Entrepreneurship education and training as facilitators of regional development: A systematic literature review
TT  - Entrepreneurship education and training
AN  - 2533469625
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to provide insights of a systematic literature review (SLR) of the entrepreneurship education and training as facilitators of regional development. Current and future trends in the field are identified.Design/methodology/approachThe paper offers an SLR on the entrepreneurship education and training and advances through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis comprising the period 1973-2016. To collect data, only articles published in scientific journals were used in the SCOPUS database.FindingsThe results highlight that both training and entrepreneurship education can be a strong strategic tool for regional development, and that it is important for entities such as academia, government and business to cooperate towards the same goal in order to strengthen the entrepreneurial intention of society. Findings reveal three clusters as trends of literature: entrepreneurial universities, entrepreneurial spirit and process of business creation.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to fill the gap in terms of SLR on the importance of entrepreneurship education and training for regional development conducted by a bibliometric analysis.

T1  - Entrepreneurial academics and academic entrepreneurs: a systematic literature review: Journal international de la gestion technologique
AN  - 2038551512
AB  - Universities are now viewed as key economic actors within regions and are central actors in shaping and influencing entrepreneurial ecosystems. This has meant that universities now have to become more entrepreneurial in offerings, outlook and culture. However, a core actor in this process who is often overlooked is the academic. The ability of an academic to effectively transfer knowledge to industry is key to universities achieving their entrepreneurial mission and ambition. This paper explores the changing roles of academics to identify key distinctions between entrepreneurial academics and academic entrepreneurs. This is done through a systematic literature review spanning 25 years drawing on selected high impact journals in innovation, entrepreneurship and higher education studies. We categorise the types of activity that academics typically engage in and identify the motivations and challenges they face. From this, we identify two types of academics, the entrepreneurial academic and academic entrepreneur. We posit that there is a need for both types of academics to contribute to the success of the entrepreneurial university and conclude by outlining some avenues for future research.

T1  - A review of qualitative case methods trends and themes used in technology transfer research
AN  - 1917822510
AB  - The focus of this paper is to review the qualitative case methods that have been used in technology transfer research over the last 20 years from 1996 to 2015. Case methods allow for more in-depth analyses and provide the opportunity to place research into a certain context due to the selection of e.g. specific sectors, institutions, countries, etc. Using a systematic literature review of five of the top journals in the field of technology transfer research, namely Journal of Technology Transfer, Research Policy, Science and Public Policy, R&D Management and Technovation, it yielded 107 articles using the search terms: "Technology Transfer" AND ("Case Study" OR "Case Method" OR "Qualitative"). Our findings indicate a clustering of themes using qualitative case methods around technology transfer mechanisms and TTOs, academic entrepreneurship, university-industry collaboration, commercialization as well as R&D and firm knowledge transfer. We also identify trends in case method technology transfer research with respect to authorship, location of papers, sectoral contexts, data collection, numbers of cases and data analysis software. We conclude our paper discussing the implications of trends and themes and suggest that researchers need to reflect on used terminology and their utilization and postulate a need for more plurality of data collection methods.

T1  - Illuminating the black box of entrepreneurship education programmes: Part 2
AN  - 1896276854
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to provide a justified, legitimate and validated model on entrepreneurship education programmes (EEPs), by combining recent research and scholarship in leading edge entrepreneurship education (EE).Design/methodology/approachA systematic literature review of recent EE research and scholarship is followed by an empirical study to develop a model of EEPs. This was adopted by employing an emergent inquiry perspective incorporating participatory action research, using frame analysis and NVIVO to develop and analyse themes.FindingsThis research identified three unique dimensions currently excluded from the theoretical and scholarship of EEPs, being distinct contextualisation, entrepreneurship ecosystems and recent content innovation in entrepreneurship. It also identified updates to current EEPs dimensions, such as online technologies, authentic alignment, causation, effectuation and bricolage, technology transfer the entrepreneurial university.Research limitations/implicationsThe discussion and model presented in this paper may be a starting point for future empirical studies on EEPs, by developing additional validation, justification and legitimisation.Practical implicationsThe study indicates that EEPs are integrative and dynamic, and always limited to contextual and contemporary inferences; providing guidance to developing such programmes. Hence, the applicability to update the original framework developed by Maritz and Brown (2013) as Part 2 of illuminating the black box of EEPs.Originality/valueThis paper provides a first of its kind empirical study in the development of EEPs frameworks and models, deepening the theory, scholarship and development of such models.

T1  - Entrepreneurial university: towards a better understanding of past trends and future directions
AN  - 1914535853
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore and analyse the literature, related to the Entrepreneurial University, published in the ISI Web of Science, from 1900 to present. The objectives of this paper are, first, to describe how this field of research is organised in terms of publications, authors and sources (i.e. documents), and, second, to identify the main references cited and ways in which they are grouped (i.e. clusters). In addition, this paper discusses how this literature presents challenges. Namely, from this bibliometric study, what has already been studied and the limits of these studies, as well as the research opportunities for this area, can be understood.Design/methodology/approachThe documents obtained from a search of the ISI Web of Science were subjected to a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software.FindingsA systematic literature review showed that universities are increasingly dedicated to the commercialisation of knowledge. The results include three clusters: Cluster one – “Entrepreneurial Universities” focuses on changes in the university paradigm; Cluster two – “Academic Entrepreneurship” refers to the commercialisation of knowledge; and Cluster three – “Creation of Technology-Based Companies” focuses on spin-off creation.Originality/valueBy studying the citation profile of documents on the entrepreneurial university, this study has contributed to a better understanding of the flow of production and scientific practices since the beginning of the 21st century.  This study also examined research tendencies to identify the emergent areas of this field.

T1  - University Knowledge Transfer Offices and Social Responsibility
AN  - 1858321351
AB  - Numerous studies and reviews about University Knowledge Transfer Offices (UKTO) have been written, but there are few that focus on Social Responsibility (SR). We present a systematic review of the research on both fields. We consider not only logics from agency theory and resource-based view, but also the dynamic approach from institutional theory, as they aim to generate sustainable economic and social value. The evolution of Knowledge Transfer Offices depends on their role as brokers of collaborations among different stakeholders, according to their mission and capacity to confront the innovation gap. We follow the line of SR viewed as a response to the specific demands of large stakeholders. Building upon recent conceptualizations of different theories, we develop an integrative model for understanding the institutional effects of the UKTO on university social responsibility.

T1  - University technology transfer in China: a literature review and taxonomy
AN  - 1818626014
AB  - The Chinese university system is one of the world's largest academic research performers and technology transfer is one of the system's central roles. Academic interest in Chinese university technology transfer in both the West and China has increased in parallel. This review aims to outline what is known and evaluate the state of research about university technology transfer in China. To be comprehensive, uniquely this review considers the relevant journal articles in both English and Chinese languages. The major themes and methodologies used by authors are identified. The evolution of the literature, particularly those in Chinese from general discussions often with minimal citations to more empirically rigorous studies is documented. It is also shown that the English and Chinese language literatures have little overlap in terms of citations, thereby indicating that the two research communities are still largely disconnected. It is found that the sources of data have remained quite limited and the quantitative research is based almost entirely upon government statistics collected for administrative purpose. The concluding discussion suggests possible avenues for future progress in terms of developing new data sources and increasing the cross-fertilization of two research communities.

T1  - Public policy measures in support of knowledge transfer activities: a review of academic literature
AN  - 1787237233
AB  - Despite the wealth of academic studies that analyze different policy measures and initiatives implemented by national or regional governments to support knowledge transfer from academia to industry, scant systematization efforts seek to integrate these disparate lines of research. The systematic review of academic studies on public policy measures in support of technology transfer presented by this article suggests a literature classification based on two dimensions: the type of policy measure analyzed, and the focus of the study (i.e., policy design vs. impact assessment). On the basis of this comprehensive review, we summarize the lessons learned thus far, identify research gaps that continue to limit insights into public policy measures for technology transfer, and highlight directions for further research.

T1  - The gender dimension in knowledge and technology transfer – the German case
AN  - 2084976190
AB  - Purpose – Knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) and particularly academic entrepreneurship (Klofsten and Jones-Evans, 2000) are indispensable for economic growth and wealth creation. In many European countries including Germany, substantially fewer women than men participate in KTT. Recently, decision makers from scientific, political, and commercial organisations have increased their attention to the gender dimension (e.g. Moser, 2007; Schiebinger, 2013). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate in what ways and to what degree gender is currently integrated in German KTT. Design/methodology/approach – By following an abductive approach (Suddaby, 2006) and building upon existing models (Klofsten and Jones-Evans, 2000; Carlsson et al., 2002; Lundvall, 2010), the authors developed an analytical framework for evaluating the position of the gender dimension in KTT, conducted a comprehensive literature review, and 22 key informant interviews. Findings – The findings indicate that the gender dimension is barely integrated in German KTT, which particularly manifests itself through the fact that there are fewer than 10 per cent women among academic entrepreneurs. Current organisational practices and attitudes of decision makers continue to reinforce traditional gender roles and “typically male” approaches and behaviours (Connell, 2005; Redien-Collot, 2009). Originality/value – The authors were the first to synthesise a variety of sources into one unified framework and to rigorously analyse the gender dimension in German KTT – both quantitatively and qualitatively and on different levels. This framework can help decisions makers, both in- and outside of Germany, re-envision KTT practices, and create new opportunities for its diverse participants.

T1  - The evolution of universities' relations with the business sector in Brazil: What national publications between 1980 and 2012 reveal
AN  - 1785376050
AB  - This paper addresses the changes in university-industry relations in Brazil regarding innovation activities. It is based on a survey of articles published in major national journals or presented at the most relevant Brazilian and regional conferences, between 1980 and 2012. The year 1980 was chosen due to the creation of the Technological Innovation Offices (NITs), which was the first government initiative to encourage knowledge transfer from universities to companies; the second was the Innovation Act of 2004. Our assumption was that after the Act the number of academic papers on this subject would increase, bringing new ideas and propositions of models to enhance this relationship. The methodology employed a qualitative, exploratory approach, using bibliographical research and a bibliometric analysis of 247 papers. Literature review of international studies shows the discussion of problems and suggestions for improvements, while in Brazil there is still a debate on whether this collaboration should occur, and if this is a legitimate role for the university. Despite the numerical growth, the content analysis showed few papers on new configurations and procedures for partnership management. We conclude that university-industry relations are not a regular and totally accepted process in Brazilian public universities, which reflect an ideological bias against cooperation with firms.

T1  - Stages and Pathways of Development of Nonprofit Organizations: An Integrative Model
AN  - 1712277517
AB  - Most research suggests that nonprofit organizations (NPOs) should professionalize in order to become more efficient. Yet, a growing body of literature emphasizes the importance of preserving some of their original grassroots culture. Based on a qualitative meta-analysis of 19 in-depth cases from the past decade, our integrative model contributes to this debate in three important ways: first, we suggest that most NPO pathways of development are characterized by the acquisition of a dual nature i.e., a community setting a value-based mission (stage 1) and a professional structure involving formal and centralized coordination aimed at effectiveness (stage 2); second, that this dual system often leads NPOs to an existential crisis characterized by contradiction and indetermination (stage 3); and third, that this indetermination constitutes a window of opportunity for deciders to more deliberately arbitrate the orientation adopted by their NPOs (stage 4). We discuss the role of deciders, beyond institutional pressures, to explain why the nonprofit sector is still relatively diverse. We propose voluntarism and institutional entrepreneurship as important mainstays of nonprofitness.

T1  - Knowledge and skills transfer between MBA and workplace
AN  - 2250599363
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to use goal-setting theory to explain the transfer of knowledge and skills between master of business administration (MBA) and the workplace. Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained by an online survey of MBA students enrolled in at four US graduate business schools. These were a public and private institution in the Northeast region, a private sectarian institution in the Midwest region and a private institution in the Pacific region. All students worked while attending the university. The sampling frame consisted of each school’s MBA enrollees. Questionnaires were distributed to a random cross-section of part-time students at each graduate school of business representative of returned by 144 students. The profiles of responders were consistent with parameters for the entire MBA student population. Findings – The research shows that multiple goals of reciprocal knowledge and skills transfer may be in harmony and mutually reinforcing. In principle, each goal is more likely to be attained with greater economy of effort than might be surmised. Additionally, the same forces may act similarly to facilitate attainment of two well-integrated goals, in this case transfer between MBA studies and work, as well as between work and MBA studies. Research limitations/implications – The present study involved participants from part-time public and private MBA granting institutions in the USA. The study tested and extended goal-setting theory and introduced the innovative concept of reciprocal transfer. Future studies should seek to generalize the findings to a broader population of part-time MBA students, especially from other nations. Despite its strengths, the findings of this study need to be interpreted in the perspective of some limitations. The current study did not measure transfer climates in either the organization or university settings. Transfer climates undoubtedly have an important bearing on transfer outcomes. Practical implications – Review of the present study suggests that a positive MBA environment is needed to influence motivation to learn and perceptions of the MBA program’s utility, thereby promoting transfer of knowledge and skills to MBA studies from the workplace. A supportive work-to-MBA-studies transfer climate will lead to more active learning of course content that has greater relevance for achieving career goals. Potentially generalizable from the organizational transfer climate literature (Rouiller and Goldstein 1990; Rouiller and Goldstein 1993), positive transfer from work to MBA studies will occur when appropriate situational cues and consequences are present in the program. Social implications – A constructive implication suggested by the findings of this study would be the intervention and transfer management by educators to structure and strengthen the university transfer climate of their part-time MBA programs. Traditionally, the concept of transfer climate has been primarily applied to employee workplace training activity and job performance. The university culture of the MBA student might emphasize and reward continuous learning from workplace experiences. Opportunities at the university should be provided for the exercise of newly acquired workplace skills that reinforce MBA learning experiences. Originality/value – This is the first study that shows how learning goals and performance goals are integrated in the context of a new concept, i.e. reciprocal transfer of knowledge and skills between MBA and workplace settings. It also demonstrates, for the first time, the impact of learning and motivation for MBA studies and perceived utility of MBA program on the extent of transfer of learning and skills from the workplace to the university setting.

T1  - SELECTED BARRIERS MANAGEMENT OF COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
AN  - 2505531683
AB  - Commercialisation of the university researches and innovations is an integral part of a knowledge based institution. Thereby, due to the importance of commercialisation, certain institutions are working to speed up the diffusion process and technology transfer of new technology or new products or new services. In the world of globalization, universities are required to get involved in activities to commercialize university research and innovations to industries. It’s important that all activities and organizational structures related to commercialisation of academic research should be managed in a way which should increase commercialisation with minimum negative effect on education and research. It’s also desirable that it should also improve university’s overall capacity to perform different functions. The above mentioned facts make commercialisation of academic research a big challenge for university. The most of work highlights the relevance of collaborative research, contract research, consulting and informal relationships for university – industry knowledge transfer. We present a systematic review of research on academic scientists’ involvement in these activities to which we refer as ‘university research’.

T1  - Venture creation programs: bridging entrepreneurship education and technology transfer
AN  - 2084366689
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how university-based entrepreneurship programs, incorporating real-life venture creation into educational design and delivery, can bridge the gap between entrepreneurship education and technology transfer within the university environment. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review and snowball sampling over a two-year period, 18 entrepreneurship education programs were identified as applying a venture creation approach. Ten of these programs were selected for case study, including direct interviews and participatory observation during a two-day workshop. Empirical findings were iteratively related to theory within entrepreneurship education and technology transfer. Findings – The paper identifies the bridging capabilities of venture creation programs (VCP) across five core themes, illustrating the potential benefits of closer collaboration between entrepreneurship education and technology transfer in a university environment. Research limitations/implications – A definition for “VCP” is tested empirically. These programs are shown to be sophisticated laboratory environments, allowing for clinical research towards the understanding of entrepreneurship and technology transfer processes. Practical implications – Findings identify practical benefits of combining entrepreneurship education and technology transfer activities, such as increased value creation through not only new firms, but also an entrepreneurially equipped graduate population. VCPs allow for “spin-through” of innovative ideas in the university environment, while simultaneously contributing to entrepreneurial learning. Originality/value – This paper presents findings from the first multiple case study into entrepreneurship education specifically designed to develop real-life venture as part of the core curriculum. Findings provide basis for investigating the value of integrating entrepreneurship education and technology transfer at the university.

T1  - Invisible Intermediaries: A Systematic Review into The Role of Research Management in University and Institutional Research Processes
AN  - 1647345174
AB  - The introduction of competitive rankings and research assessment frameworks have necessitated that research organisations continually monitor their research strengths and weaknesses. Such monitoring is essential to be able to strategically respond in a competitive environment. There is little research on the role of research management in research organisations, including universities, but the literature suggests that when implemented well, research management is an essential component of the research process. Despite this, an evidence-based understanding of the strategies available for successful research management is lacking. In order for organisations to structure their research management strategies more efficiently, as well as to inform practitioners of the best way to deliver their service, an understanding of the evidence for successful research management strategies is needed. The aim of this article is to provide a systematic review to investigate the evidence base for successful research management strategies.

AN  - 1659031594
AB  - Purpose - transformation of regular traditional university is a natural going process, which was affected not only by attractive theoretical or practical meaning of entrepreneurial university, but by the necessity of economic and social changes, as well. According to that, university is an important member of "Triple Helix" (University-Industry-State) model importance of collective intelligence for the implementation and development of "Third Mission" of university hybrid. "Triple Helix" model's expansion is being proven in the upshot of analysis of scientific literature.

              
Design/Methodology/Approach - analysis of scientific literature.

              
Findings - after literature analysis, the following findings are presented: Concept of "Third Mission"; The importance of entrepreneurial university for "Third Mission's" implementation is investigated; The importance of collective intelligence for "Third Mission's" implementation is highlighted.

              
Practical usage - according to the necessity of fast changes for Lithuanian and for East European universities in common, it is being expected that proven importance of collective intelligence for the implementation of "Third Mission" of university will affect the research of unique interdisciplinary solutions.

              
Originality/Value - the main concept of collective intelligence is not really new, but the article explains its value for entrepreneurial university and for implementation of "Third Mission". The development of hybrid "Triple Helix" model has not been investigated properly yet. Because of this, it is expected that the article will affect the start of new discussions and research of new solutions.

T1  - Indicators of Entrepreneurial University: Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy TOPSIS Approach
AN  - 1525572101
AB  - The phenomenon of entrepreneurial universities has received considerable attention over the last decades. An entrepreneurial orientation by academia can lead to innovative and sustainable products and research mobilization which help in putting regions and nations in an advantageous position in emerging knowledge-intensive fields of economic activity. Many empirical researches focused on entrepreneurial orientation of university students, but study on antecedents and criteria of the entrepreneurial universities is scarce. The main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive criteria set for evaluation of entrepreneurial universities. In this context, environmental and internal factors of entrepreneurial universities were identified based on literature review and survey. Twelve academics and managers have participated in this study by weighing the criteria and scoring alternatives. Society, in particular, higher education institutions, and universities can use the results for creation of new businesses and spin-offs. Data was analyzed by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS).[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Critical Success Factors for Knowledge Transfer Collaborations between University and Industry
AN  - 1503137576
AB  - In a fast moving business environment university-industry collaborations play a critical role in contributing to national economies and furthering a competitive advantage. Knowledge transfer from university to industry is supported by national governments as part of their innovation, national growth and competitiveness agenda. A university-industry landscape involves multiple stakeholders with multiple, and often contradicting, objectives and organizational mind-set and cultures. The paper is based on a systematic literature review of the effectiveness of university-industry collaborations from a holistic perspective in order to identify drivers and barriers to a fruitful collaboration. A dedicated section explores knowledge transfer in the emerging market context to provide an international dimension to a growing international trend in university-industry collaboration. The key findings on success factors relate to organizational and individual contexts, knowledge attributes and relational aspects. The literature research findings are further tested through a survey of key stakeholders: university managers, researchers, industry managers and government representatives, revealing differences in perception among various stakeholders' groups. The paper provides an insight into drivers and potential barriers in university-industry collaborations. The findings enable developing a practical framework for the universities to support their decision-making process. The framework can be used a support tool for evaluating university-industry collaborations both generally and in the international context. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on university-industry relations
AN  - 1312338034
AB  - A considerable body of work highlights the relevance of collaborative research, contract research, consulting and informal relationships for university-industry knowledge transfer. We present a systematic review of research on academic scientists' involvement in these activities to which we refer as 'academic engagement'. Apart from extracting findings that are generalisable across studies, we ask how academic engagement differs from commercialisation, defined as intellectual property creation and academic entrepreneurship. We identify the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents and consequences of academic engagement, and then compare these findings with the antecedents and consequences of commercialisation. Apart from being more widely practiced, academic engagement is distinct from commercialisation in that it is closely aligned with traditional academic research activities, and pursued by academics to access resources supporting their research agendas. We conclude by identifying future research needs, opportunities for methodological improvement and policy interventions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Research collaboration in universities and academic entrepreneurship: the-state-of-the-art
AN  - 1267230072
AB  - There is abundant evidence that research collaboration has become the norm in every field of scientific and technical research. We provide a critical overview of the literature on research collaboration, focusing particularly on individual-level collaborations among university researchers, but we also give attention to university researchers' collaborations with researchers in other sectors, including industry. We consider collaborations aimed chiefly at expanding the base of knowledge (knowledge-focused collaborations) as well as ones focused on production of economic value and wealth (property-focused collaborations), the latter including most academic entrepreneurship research collaborations. To help organize our review we develop a framework for analysis, one that considers attributes of collaborators, collaborative process and organization characteristics as the affect collaboration choices and outcomes. In addition, we develop and use a "Propositional Table for Research Collaboration Literature," presented as an "Appendix" to this study. We conclude with some suggestions for possible improvement in research on collaboration including: (1) more attention to multiple levels of analysis and the interactions among them; (2) more careful measurement of impacts as opposed to outputs; (3) more studies on 'malpractice' in collaboration, including exploitation; (4) increased attention to collaborators' motives and the social psychology of collaborative teams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Knowledge management in SMEs: a literature review
AN  - 1115339958
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to review research on knowledge management in small and medium-sized enterprises to identify gaps in the current body of knowledge, which justify future research directions. Design/methodology/approach - The study consists of a systematic review of 36-refereed empirical articles on knowledge management and small and medium-sized enterprises. Findings - The areas of knowledge management implementation, knowledge management perception, and knowledge transfer are relatively well researched topics; whereas those of knowledge identification, knowledge storage/retention and knowledge utilisation are poorly understood. Given the prevalence of small and medium-sized enterprises there is a strong need for more research on this important topic. The future research directions proposed by the authors may help to develop a greater understanding of knowledge management in small and medium-sized enterprises. Research limitations/implications - By only using the ProQuest database this study may not have allowed a complete coverage of all empirical articles in the field of knowledge management in small and medium-sized enterprises. Yet, it is believed that the findings provide a valuable understanding of the current situation in this research field. The study proposes a number of future research directions, which may stimulate more intensive research in this important field. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, no systematic literature review on this topic has previously been published in academic journals.

T1  - Management accounting change and sustainability: an institutional approach
AN  - 1100241292
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to propose an institutional entrepreneurship approach to examining management accounting change triggered by social and environmental concerns. The study begins with a literature review concerning the role that old institutional economics and new institutional sociology have played in the study of management accounting change, underlining strengths and weaknesses. To deal with the main weaknesses, the institutional entrepreneurship approach is presented and utilized as the basis for the development of a conceptual framework, which is contextualized to the examination of management accounting change triggered by sustainability issues. Management accounting change literature has not paid enough attention to the social constructivist roots of institutional theory. Through the application of a conceptual framework inspired by institutional change models and institutional entrepreneurship literature, this paper proposes another approach to examine how new management accounting practices are socially constructed during the course of organizational change, particularly in response to sustainability concerns.

AN  - 1019286076
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the main factors affecting researcher engagement in knowledge transfer exchanges (KTE) in an Open Innovation (OI) context, devoting special attention to specific factors such as personal and professional profile, institutional variables, social networks and recognition. Design/methodology/approach - An extensive literature review was conducted, focusing on current studies concerning the OI concept and research lines, OI and universities, KTE, and the factors affecting researcher engagement in university KTE. Based on this review a conceptual framework was proposed, including four main factors that affect KTE researcher engagement (personal and professional, institutional, social networks and recognition). The assumptions of this framework were explored in an empirical study involving 382 senior researchers, acting as leaders of different research groups, at Spanish universities. This was followed by univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Findings - Results show that, apart from recognition, most of the proposed factors affect researcher engagement in KTE processes. The social network factors appear to be the most important, as all items were significant in affecting the engagement of researchers in these processes. Research limitations/implications - Both the study and the statistical analysis are exploratory, therefore results should be treated with caution. Moreover, the data were collected from only one country, hence, in order to improve validity, additional data would be needed. Practical implications - Social networks (between researchers, businesses, university administrators, University Technology Transfer Office directors, etc.) should be promoted in order to improve researcher involvement in university KTE in an OI context. Originality/value - There is a lack of research literature discussing factors affecting researcher engagement in KTE processes. Moreover, researcher involvement is a key factor in contributing to the success of KTE. This paper provides a thorough discussion of these factors and proposes a conceptual framework with which they may be studied in the context of OI.

T1  - International transfer of employee-oriented CSR practices by multinational SMEs
AN  - 873623731
AB  - Purpose - Starting from the question whether the globalisation process leads to a social "race to the bottom", this paper aims to highlight the international transfer of socially responsible, employee-oriented practices by multinational small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as a possible way to counter such a trend. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a literature review, an exploratory framework - building on three perspectives - is proposed about the conditions in which employee-oriented corporate social responsibility (CSR) affects long-term firm performance positively. First, the stakeholder view on CSR entails that employees can be considered as legitimate stakeholders of the firm justifying introduction of employee-oriented CSR. Second, the human resource management perspective matters as employee-oriented CSR materialises in human resource management policies and practices that increase employee commitment. Finally, as regulative, normative and cognitive institutions differ across countries, the institutionalist perspective is relevant to understand diverging demands on content and form of employee-oriented CSR practices. Findings - It is argued that owner-managers of (multinational) SMEs, who view their employees as legitimate stakeholders of the firm, will introduce employee-oriented CSR out of their sense of moral responsibility towards their employees. This sense of moral responsibility is conditional on achieving sustainable mutual value creation as a result of employee-oriented CSR. Finally, transfer of employee-oriented CSR to foreign subsidiaries is positively mediated by the level of owner-managers' institutional entrepreneurship. Originality/value - This is one of the few studies addressing the position of employees as internal stakeholders of small and medium-sized enterprises in an international context. It signals the relevance of institutional differences across countries to entrepreneurs who wish to improve long-term firm performance through employee-oriented CSR.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Categories of university-level entrepreneurship: a literature survey
AN  - 872076363
AB  - Research into the nature, antecedents and effects of university-level entrepreneurship has grown due to the emergence of the university technology transfer phenomenon and the evolution of university's role in national innovation systems and economic development. From the literature survey, three research categories for university-level entrepreneurship are identified and examined namely entrepreneurial university, academic entrepreneurship and university technology transfer. Then, a framework depicting the relationship of the three research categories is developed and discussed. Lastly, recommendations are made for future research and analysis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
