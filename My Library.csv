Proc.","978-081691067-0 (ISBN)","","","https://www-scopus-com-cimr.knimbus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860249770&partnerID=40&md5=4c64fe2c50047f3687f226573a39e327","The traditional university role of performing fundamental research leaves a large gap between the laboratory stage ""proof of principle"" and the generation of economic benefits in the commercial marketplace. Research funding for universities from the federal government tends to focus on basic research. Companies usually prefer to license technology with most of the risk taken out. This risk reduction normally occurs via the development component of the research and development process. Unfortunately, the cost of D is often 10 plus times the cost of R, which puts this effort out of reach of most universities. In addition, the opportunity for publication and contribution to advancing the state of the art science (the usual focus of university research) is limited as the development activity concentrates on such issues as economic tradeoffs, catalyst life, feedstock impurities, manufacturing processes, corrosion and other materials of construction issues, product specifications, and mechanical hardware problems. To bridge this gap, Illinois Institute of Technology has put in place a series of practices to address the problems that stand in the way of the university's ability to pursue commercial success for new technology. Our primary practice is to establish startup companies by the inventing faculty members who continue to guide the technology development process into the commercial marketplace. Additional contributors are undergraduate students working on these more-practical problems, mutually beneficial strategic alliances with existing commercial companies, incubator facilities with their ancillary networking potential, senior executives and alumni acting as friends of the university in mentoring entrepreneurial faculty, the technology transfer function of the university, the university's marketing and communications professionals, and alignment of startup company interests with the university's goals via equity investment in the company. This presentation describes how these practices have also provided benefits to our development partners from industry.","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: AIChE Annu.

This study was conducted in four major phases. The study started with a SWOT analysis of the economy in Turkey and continued with an analysis of ID education using data on undergraduate and graduate education programmes, the number of faculty members, the number of graduates and the number of registered students. After identifying the profile of the industrial designer from the perspective of industry through online job advertisements, the correlation between the expectations of industry and the philosophy of ID and IPD education programmes in Turkey was analysed. The findings demonstrate that Turkey is behind other countries in terms of intellectual property rights, new products development and investment in new fields of business. Moreover, the share of resources allocated for research and development is insufficient. The education model of IPD and ID graduate programmes is inconsistent with the industry expectations. The expectations of the industry and the educational emphases of university programmes are extremely incompatible. The findings of this study will help to develop cooperation between industry and education programmes and will thus lead to better employment opportunities for graduates of IPD and ID programmes. © BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING PLC 2013 PRINTED IN THE UK.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","74-102","","1","16","","Des.

Design/methodology/approach - The study begins with a literature review concerning the role that old institutional economics and new institutional sociology have played in the study of management accounting change, underlining strengths and weaknesses. To deal with the main weaknesses, the institutional entrepreneurship approach is presented and utilized as the basis for the development of a conceptual framework, which is contextualized to the examination of management accounting change triggered by sustainability issues. Findings - Management accounting change literature has not paid enough attention to the social constructivist roots of institutional theory. Through the application of a conceptual framework inspired by institutional change models and institutional entrepreneurship literature, this paper proposes another approach to examine how new management accounting practices are socially constructed during the course of organizational change, particularly in response to sustainability concerns. Research limitations/implications - This new framework has not yet demonstrated its explanatory power in a particular field. Originality/value - The paper examines management accounting change as a social construction process led by institutional entrepreneurs who aim to mobilize resources and negotiate the definition and implementation of sustainability strategies and new management accounting practices, which will take environmental and social issues into consideration, in order to reach an agreement on the pre-institutionalization, diffusion and institutionalization of sustainable practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2012","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-26 14:46:52","","286-309","","3","8","","J.

Several intergovernmental agencies have set up specific programmes to support the diffusion of climate mitigation technologies. Using a simplified technological innovation system-based framework, this paper aims to systematically review these programmes, with the dual aim of assessing their collective success in promoting technological innovation, and identifying opportunities for the newly formed UNFCCC Technology Mechanism. We conclude that, while all programmes reviewed have promoted technology transfer, they have given limited attention to innovation capabilities with users, government and universities. Functions that could be further developed include knowledge development, legitimation and market formation. These could be focal areas for the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism.

The study aims to identify barriers to effectively capture lessons learned in Australian construction industry and how knowledge management can benefit from lessons learned application. Design/methodology/approach - The research study has been undertaken through conducting a ""methodological triangulation"" and ""interdisciplinary triangulation"". This involved an extensive literature review of knowledge management, organisation learning, lessons learned and associated processes and administration of a questionnaire to a sample of construction contractors operating in Australia to elicit opinions on the main barriers to capturing lessons learned, practices such as existence and retention of documentation procedures. A total of 81 useable responses were received from 450 organisations. Response data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics with correlation analysis to examine the strength of relationship among the barriers. Findings - The top-3 barriers to the effective capturing of lessons learned were ""lack of employee time"", ""lack of resources"" and ""lack of clear guidelines"", whereas, ""lack of management support"" was the least ranked barrier. The study established that despite the majority of the ACCs having formal procedures for recording the tenders submitted and their outcomes, only a minority actually retained the lessons learned documentation for each project. The larger contractors were found to be more aware of the importance of lessons learned documentation. A comparative analysis with previous studies also found a disparity in the ranking of the barriers. Research limitations/implications - The majority of the participants were small construction contractors in Australia. The reason is that the researchers were not aware of the contractors' size prior to inviting them for participation in the research study. Second the findings may not generalize to other industries or to organisations operating in other countries. Originality/value - The findings of this survey help ACCs to understand the importance of lessons learned documentation as part of lessons learned implementation and identify the barriers to effectively document their lessons learned. The study provides insights on the barriers and proposes advocated solutions in form of drivers and enablers (critical success factors) of organisational learning capturing among the Australian construction contractors. By reviewing the current literature, ""post-project reviews"" and ""lessons learned"" as important elements of organisation learning knowledge transfer, are addressed. Finally, contribution of this study to knowledge and practice has been discussed in this paper. Copyright © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

A literature review was undertaken to interrogate the possibility of applying the teaching-research-innovation nexus at one university of technology in South Africa. Literature shows that the teaching-research-innovation nexus is a debate that has always occupied higher education. Some researchers argue that there can be no teaching without research or research without teaching. However, bringing synergy between teachingresearch and innovation is a complex process. The literature revealed that in order to realise the synergy among the three forces it is vital for an entrepreneurial university to forge partnerships with industry and surrounding communities. The authors believe that, with broad economic participation, innovation and new enterprise development - realisable for instance through a science park within the institution to support entrepreneurship - poverty among neighbouring communities can be mediated. The process will contribute to the country's development initiatives.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","63-72","","13","4","","Mediterranean J. Soc.

In order to determine EI, a hybrid multi-method framework consisting of Delphi, Analytic Network Process (ANP), and VIKOR is proposed. The Delphi method is used to localize and reduce the number of criteria extracted from a deep literature review, according to the social and economic conditions of Iranian state universities by using an expert panel, including sixty-eight country-wide academicians and practitioners. After that, a group approach to ANP was utilized as an evaluation method to derive the weights of each criterion. Next, the evaluation data were gathered through a questionnaire, and, finally, the compromise ranking of universities was calculated using the VIKOR method. Moreover, this study applies weight-variance analysis (WVA) to suggest improvement actions. The paper proposes an evaluation framework for determining the performance of entrepreneurship development initiatives in universities. By using this framework, twenty-two Iranian state universities are evaluated in terms of their EI, and the results are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","207-226","","2","65","","High.

From a literature review, we conclude that private ownership of university patents may reduce the efficiency of the knowledge transfer process. This hypothesis is put to an empirical test, using data on patents in six European countries. Specifically, we assesswhetheruniversity-owned patents(inEurope)aremoreoftenapplied,and/ormore economically valuable, than university-invented (but not-owned) patents.

The importance of knowledge is acknowledged through various papers and studies on knowledge production and its impact on growth. In a knowledge-based economy characterized by the production, transmission and dissemination of knowledge, the higher education institutions (universities) play a unique role in all these knowledge process steps. An efficient knowledge management in a university will ensure the best use of available resources and best use of the knowledge as a key resource; creation / generation of new knowledge; understanding and awareness; capturing, organizing, storing the knowledge at individual, group and organization level; and knowledge transfer to other persons or other organizations. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role of universities in supporting the development of knowledge economy in Romania and to highlight the extent to which students consider that the Romanian economic university system is ready to face the demands of KBES. The results are based on students' perception on the role that the higher education institutions within the context of KBES in Romania. The study is based on the answers of questioned students from the Faculty of Business Administration with teaching in foreign languages (FABIZ) of the Academy of Economic Studies of Bucharest. The study acknowledged the importance of knowledge management in education institutions and identified challenges that the institutions will be facing. The paper is structured as following: the first part of the paper introduces briefly the concepts of knowledge and knowledge-based economy and society; the second part provides a short literature review on knowledge production and its importance for growth; the third part draws on the role the higher education institutions can play as knowledge institutions; part four presents the case-study assessing the perceived role of higher education institutions within the context of KBES in Romania, while the last part concludes.","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","960-966","","","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: This is an examination of the KTP approach and how this could be used effectively in undergraduate education and training to encourage and increase practice-based learning and employer engagement. The methodology consists of a literature review, and a case study of the KTP approach. The literature reviewed examines the KTP approach, employer engagement in education and strategic government approaches to stimulate investment in knowledge and skills for workforce development, and the development of practice-based learning in the UK. The KTP provides a case study to illustrate a successful model of employer engagement, which benefits all parties to it, and assists with the strategic development required by successive governments. Findings: The suggestions are based on the authors' investigation and their understanding and experience of: the KTP approach; practice-based learning; undergraduate education; and learning and teaching approaches. The paper suggests that the KTP approach (normally a post-graduate model) could be extended to undergraduate education to provide sustainable practice-based learning that fits well with the strategies and ideologies of government, employers and academia. Practical implications: Barriers to employer and academic engagement, such as that linked to the confused terminology used to describe practice-based learning, and competing political ideologies, should be researched further to gain a better understanding of how to mitigate these in order to make the KTP approach in undergraduate education successful. The implications are that synergistic development of the KTP approach in an increased range of academic and workplace partnerships needs to be done before a fully tested model could be agreed. Originality/value: The originality is the idea of utilising a well acknowledged post-graduate model of learning within an undergraduate environment. The value is to increase the awareness of the benefits of the KTP and how the approach could be adapted for use in undergraduate environments for the eventual benefit of students, academics, employers and policy makers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-26 14:41:05","","174-190","","2","55","","Educ.

Being able to access and share information ensures healthcare practitioners can keep abreast of new and ever changing information and improve services. The purpose of this paper is to present an information management-knowledge transfer (IM-KT) framework which emerged from a study looking at digital literacy in the occupational therapy profession. Design/methodology/approach: The research was undertaken in three stages. First an in-depth literature review was undertaken, which enabled the creation of an initial conceptual framework which in turn, informed the second stage of the research: the development of a survey about the use of digital technologies. Occupational therapy students, academics and practitioners across five different countries completed the survey, after which refinements to the framework were made. The IM-KT framework presented in this paper emerged as a result of the third stage of the study, which was completed using the Delphi technique where 18 experts were consulted over four rounds of qualitative questionnaires. Findings: The IM-KT framework assists individuals and groups to better understand how information management and knowledge transfer occurs. The framework highlights the central role of information literacy and digital literacy and the influence of context on knowledge transfer activities. Originality/value: The IM-KT framework delineates clearly between information and knowledge and demonstrates the essential role of information literacy and digital literacy in the knowledge era. This framework was developed for the occupational therapy profession and may be applicable to other professions striving to keep up to date with best evidence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2014","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","59-93","","1","44","","VINE","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; Surveys; Conceptual frameworks; Design/methodology/approach; Digital literacies; Digital literacy; Digital technologies; Evidence-based practice; Evidence-based practices; Information literacy; Information management; Information science; Occupational therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This platform, retitled as BioTourney and equipped with biology-related contents, is implemented as a self-learning assessment tool in the biology curriculum of 10th and 11th grade of a secondary school (age group: 15-17). It provides an e-learning game environment for self-paced learning based on the ability to overcome increasingly difficult levels of the biology learning curriculum. As a major gamification aspect, mastering individual levels was rewarded through feelings of achievement. Tourney itself has been developed at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland in 2014 by an interdisciplinary team of researchers from business/economics, design, computer science, applied psychology and pedagogics. The project continues to develop solutions for various application areas in higher education. Besides state-of-the-art design and game technology, Tourney comprises gamified elements of learning in order to enhance learning outcomes and knowledge transfer. With the contentindependent framework structure, teachers can create customized challenges for students by choosing and assembling modular elements associated with course-relevant learning materials. BioTourney has been released for application in the classroom after thoughtful preparation and careful testing with beta users outside the school. The experiment was carried out in October 2015 with a limited number of pupils (N=32) who have never played the game before. Game play data from the experiment have been collected and analyzed with regards to user knowledge and user interactions with the game. Learning engagement and the players' perception of learning progress were assessed through an online survey. Although the feedback has indicated moderate enjoyment in playing BioTourney, the majority of pupils have implied that they have learned something. Gameplay data analysis and player feedback suggest that BioTourney is an example where game-based learning has made a positive, measurable impact and supported personalized learning. The paper presents the research setup, the BioTourney tool as well as the test environment, and discusses the benefits and future adaptations. © The Authors, 2016.

In addition to e-learning, the literature review focuses on two theoretical fields: Appropriation, and e-Tutoring. This leads us to question the modes of e-Tutoring and their evolution; and the media coverage of the tutor in the learners&#39; process of learning. A case study, performed at Aix Marseille University, enables us to identify elements of responses to previous questions. The results show that four recurrent situated actions emerge and three types of usage. They also show that the tutor is seen primarily in a supporting role, and that he may be the social link between the platform and the learners. Beyond these results, we found that the e-Tutors may also have two other e-Tutoring roles: knowledge manager and facilitator of peer-Tutoring. This allows us ultimately to suggest that a goal of e-learning systems is to set up an e-Tutoring system, while leaving the emergence and fostering of self-organization to the learners themselves. Our research also shows that the goal of &quot;making technology transparent&quot; is reached when the acquisition of technology by students is initiated and promoted from the upstream phases of the teaching process.","2014","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","245-290","","","","","","Le rôle du tutorat en ligne dans l'appropriation des technologies dans un environnement en e-learning","","","","","Association Information and Management","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: AIM - Colloq. l'AIM - Symp.

These companies emerged in the context related to science, technology and innovation and the evolution of the University's mission. Hence, it is possible to state the importance of initiatives to stimulate university-industry relationship, the transfer/licensing of technologies and the creation of spin-off companies. In addition, the literature review addresses the concepts related to academic entrepreneurship, as well as the definitions, development models and factors that affect the process of creation and development of academic spin-offs. Therefore, an exploratory and qualitative approach was adopted. Three case studies were conducted in chemistry and physics incubated companies founded between 1990 and 2009, created by senior researchers of University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The main interest was to understand the similarities and particularities of these companies within technology-based start-ups. By performing multiple case studies, it is possible to conclude that there are characteristics related to the entrepreneur and to his company that greatly influence their growth. These characteristics are mainly related to their process of creation and development, the importance of resources, corporate formation and team formation, the product development process and the articulation of the business model. These cases are important to stimulate entrepreneurial initiatives among researchers and professionals in those areas, as examples that induce the creation of a culture for generation of new business in the midst of academic origin.

In many European countries including Germany, substantially fewer women than men participate in KTT. Recently, decision makers from scientific, political, and commercial organisations have increased their attention to the gender dimension (e.g. Moser, 2007; Schiebinger, 2013). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate in what ways and to what degree gender is currently integrated in German KTT. Design/methodology/approach – By following an abductive approach (Suddaby, 2006) and building upon existing models (Klofsten and Jones-Evans, 2000; Carlsson et al., 2002; Lundvall, 2010), the authors developed an analytical framework for evaluating the position of the gender dimension in KTT, conducted a comprehensive literature review, and 22 key informant interviews. Findings – The findings indicate that the gender dimension is barely integrated in German KTT, which particularly manifests itself through the fact that there are fewer than 10 per cent women among academic entrepreneurs. Current organisational practices and attitudes of decision makers continue to reinforce traditional gender roles and “typically male” approaches and behaviours (Connell, 2005; Redien-Collot, 2009). Originality/value – The authors were the first to synthesise a variety of sources into one unified framework and to rigorously analyse the gender dimension in German KTT – both quantitatively and qualitatively and on different levels. This framework can help decisions makers, both in- and outside of Germany, re-envision KTT practices, and create new opportunities for its diverse participants. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-26 14:41:44","","2-25","","1","19","","Eur.

For risk management, the planning, identification, analyzing, handling, documenting, and monitoring of risks were used as fundamental components. A hypothesis from the model was tested using a self-administered survey and statistical analysis. The results support the hypothesis that an increase in knowledge transfer will have a positive impact on risk management capabilities in projects. These results have implications for academics and engineering managers by providing evidence of the positive relationship between knowledge transfer and risk management capabilities in a project based environment.

A model framework is developed which is structured, linked with organizational goal, incorporates both concepts and has a wider scope. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The research methodology used in this study is a combination of literature review and key informant interviews. The literature review includes both published as well as unpublished sources of literature. In case of key informant interviews, informal telephonic discussions have been carried out with the key executives of the organizations (industry, university, research institutions and government officials) who are actively engaged in technology identification, technology sourcing and technology transfer. Findings: It is evident from the study that initial technology transfer started with the passive role of transferee and gradually they started taking the leading role in the whole technology transfer process. At the beginning, technology transfer concept was almost limited to search and transfer, gradually it started focusing on transfer plan and implementation of technology transfer and in most recent time, focus is on effectiveness of technology transfer and creating spirit of innovation. But again each one of the existing models has a limited horizon and applicability. These existing models are too specific in nature whereas the practicing managers are in need of a comprehensive integrated model. The analysis of the limitations of the existing models has proved the necessity for development of an integrated model which is structured, aims to fulfill the aspiration of the organization, closely links with organizational goal and objectives, considers the barriers and issues in technology transfer process and takes care of both Qualitative and Quantitative parameters of technology transfer. Applications/Improvements: This proposed integrated model will help the practicing managers to take proactive approach and control of forthcoming issues of technology transfer, monitor the progress as well and create spirit of innovation.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","","","35","8","","Indian J.

For instance, this is the case of Mexico with the latest science and technology law enacted in 2002 and Brazil with the innovation law enacted in 2004, among others. In these laws are stated that the universities must organize technology transfer offices to manage intellectual property and the corresponding relationship with the enterprises. More recently, in Peru was enacted the new university law in 2015. This law includes orientations for the universities about the internal organization of technology transfer and intellectual property. In this context, the purpose of this study is the literature review about the identification and characterization of the different elements of the technology transfer processes between the university and enterprise. Also, the study aims to learn how the government of different countries is helping to foster the relationship between the university and enterprise through the technology transfer offices. For this has conducted a systematic review of five databases (EBSCO, Emerald, ProQuest, IEEE and Science Direct) and a repository of conferences of the Latin American Association of Technology Management (ALTEC). Firstly, in this search it was selected the papers with the technology transfer words in the title. The period of the searching was from the year 1980 to 2015 and the result was a total of 320 scientific papers in journals and 30 conference papers. Then, it was made an initial filtering with the keywords political, negotiation, barrier, international, strategy and model. Also it was made a second filtering with the keywords University, industry and government. The analysis of the gathered information in this study shows the evolution along the time of the several elements related with the technology transfer process in the university context. Thus, it is stated that there are a growing importance of the technology transfer offices and the university spin-offs. Finally, the literature review is important for outline a framework of policies for the context of Peruvian universities about the organization of the technology transfer.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","1382-1401","","","","","","","","","","","International Association for Management of Technology Conference (IAMOT) and the Graduate School of Technology Management, University of Pretoria","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IAMOT -  Int.

We have examined successful innovators and noted similarities and differences. This article describes results from a preliminary investigation that supports a vibrant innovation ecosystem in the fields of materials, energy, and environment at Stanford University. The results are drawn from interviews of a small number of successful innovators in these fields. All of the interview subjects were similar in that they operated within a gap between the present state of the art and a vision of how a particular innovation could reshape the world around them. Important differences were also observed. We found that successful models can be grouped into three successful classes of inquiry: basic research, the search for new solutions to well-known problems, and exploiting the evolutionary arc of technology. Each class of inquiry appears to be matched to definite approaches, and we believe that distinct factors can be used to drive cultural change and enhance the effectiveness of researchers and organizations. Future research in this area may carefully examine these factors and the broader applicability of these findings to other innovation contexts.

As a result, field instrumentation is an integral part of the control curriculum for engineering disciplines that support process manufacturing. In the Chemical Engineering curriculum most of the hands-on interactions with field instruments occur in the Unit Operations (UO) laboratory. In order to make these interactions industrially relevant, dialogue and active engagement with industry are essential. In this paper we present eight features of our co-operation with industry that have significantly expanded the breadth of the UO laboratory experiences for the Chemical Engineering students and faculty. In addition to providing financial help for state-of-the-art field instruments, our industrial partners have also shared technical resources and know-how that have enabled us to integrate the technology into the curriculum in an industrially relevant way. The most notable elements that distinguish our UO laboratory are the large number of installed field instruments (173), the distributed control system (DSC), the asset management system (AMS), and the high level of active interaction with field instruments. The end result is that our students are developing a marketable skill set directly applicable to the industrial practice of control. Our faculty are benefitting from the co-operation with industry as well by being provided with various opportunities for professional development. © 2016","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","309-313","","","49","","","","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 6 Journal Abbreviation: IFAC-PapersOnLine","","","","Engineering education; Students; Technology transfer; Laboratories; Curricula; University industries; Chemical operations; Control education; Distributed parameter control systems; Field instruments; Manufacture; Partnerships; Unit Operations laboratory; Unit Operations Laboratory; University-industry co-operation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IFAC-PapersOnLine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review and snowball sampling over a twoyear period, 18 entrepreneurship education programs were identified as applying a venture creation approach. Ten of these programs were selected for case study, including direct interviews and participatory observation during a two-day workshop. Empirical findings were iteratively related to theory within entrepreneurship education and technology transfer. Findings – The paper identifies the bridging capabilities of venture creation programs (VCP) across five core themes, illustrating the potential benefits of closer collaboration between entrepreneurship education and technology transfer in a university environment. Research limitations/implications – A definition for “VCP” is tested empirically. These programs are shown to be sophisticated laboratory environments, allowing for clinical research towards the understanding of entrepreneurship and technology transfer processes. Practical implications – Findings identify practical benefits of combining entrepreneurship education and technology transfer activities, such as increased value creation through not only new firms, but also an entrepreneurially equipped graduate population. VCPs allow for “spin-through” of innovative ideas in the university environment, while simultaneously contributing to entrepreneurial learning. Originality/value – This paper presents findings from the first multiple case study into entrepreneurship education specifically designed to develop real-life venture as part of the core curriculum. Findings provide basis for investigating the value of integrating entrepreneurship education and technology transfer at the university. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-26 14:39:58","","48-73","","1","57","","Educ.

The Transportation Infrastructure Program (PITRA) of LanammeUCR, works directly with the Costa Rican government performing applied research, auditing and technology transfer. It is funded from a law that assigns 1% of the fuel tax collected in Costa Rica to LanammeUCR with the main objective of ensuring the efficiency of road investments in the country. To meet this objective, PITRA has allocated a considerable component of its funds towards the acquisition of high technology/state-of-the-art equipment such as an falling weight deflectometer, road surface profiler, Geo3D, and dynamic testing equipment for material characterization, among others.With the goal of improving the design and construction of pavements structures, as well as better understanding the different materials used, LanammeUCR decided to acquire a Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) with instrumentation.With this Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) equipment, LanammeUCR will be fully equipped to monitor the performance of different pavement structures and materials, and new and improved pavement technologies, and to develop and calibrate a mechanistic-empirical design guide for local weather, materials, and traffic conditions.

This is only possible if the required knowledge is available at the respective organizational units and workplaces. Thus, a central question to answer is: How can spillover effects of learning improve future production ramp-ups? This paper provides an overview over the existing literature on spillover effects of learning for production ramp-ups. Specifically, the antecedents, control mechanisms and performance effects of these spillover effects are considered. While learning and knowledge management in general have received attention for quite some time, there is only little research on the specific means, tools, and methods of spillover learning that are useful for seemingly unrelated processes such as production ramp-ups in different time periods. The literature on spillover learning as well as on organizational learning in production ramp-up is extensive, but the combination of the two is still under-researched. For these reasons, further research in this area can generate insights in how to better ensure transfer of tacit and explicit knowledge in the context of production ramp-ups. In this paper, we first present the state of the art of spillover learning in production ramp-ups by reviewing the existing academic literature. After that, opportunities for future research are outlined. Identified research gaps include that little is known about the process and effectiveness of knowledge transfer between consecutive ramp-ups. Especially, an unanswered question is how deliberate learning as compared to learning by doing influences knowledge spillovers to subsequent ramp-ups. In terms of scientific methods, laboratory experiments have not yet been employed in the context of spillover learning for production ramp-ups. This opens up another interesting and promising direction. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

One aim of the Think Tank is to develop a relevant research agenda that draws on the collective knowledge of participants and acknowledges the interdependent economic, environmental and social objectives in sustainable tourism. Six main areas were identified as important for a research agenda on networking for sustainable tourism and its implementation: theory, methodology and conceptual issues; actors, culture and power; lifecycle, evolution and dynamics of networks; knowledge transfer; macro-perspectives and strategic action, vision, innovation and management of networks. This paper presents and discusses these research themes in the context of a literature review on networks and networking for sustainability in tourism.

Design/methodology/approach The paper is a critical review of knowledge exchange in a business school context with a particular focus on the “translation or management practice gap”. Findings Change in the nature of research undertaken in business schools opens up new opportunities for collaboration between academia and practice. The paper points to the need for more innovative forms of research engagement encouraging academic-practitioner collaboration and practice-based management development initiatives. Research limitations/implications The paper contributes to the debate on innovative forms of knowledge exchange and transfer and helps stimulate further studies examining potential approaches to fostering co-learning and discovery and participatory forms of knowledge production. Practical implications Changes in business school environment and context offer opportunities for new modes of knowledge exchange both in management development and research. Practice based theory offers a new paradigm of management development. Originality/value Recent commentators refer to notions of academia and practice as “closed systems and self referential” and point to the requirement for greater attention on knowledge transfer, and to learn from knowledge transfer studies concerning practitioner/research communities of practice, networks and collaborations. The paper addresses this deficiency in the literature and points to key areas warranting further research. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-26 14:57:36","","116-134","","2","35","","J.

Knowledge management strategies have been used in various other fields to solve crisis situations and this paper contends that similar approaches could be adopted to address the crises in the discipline of IS. The purpose of this paper is to present a multi/theoretical model that can be used to identify knowledge transfer impediments contributing to the crises in the IS discipline in a university. Design/methodology/approach – Literature on crisis management and crises in the IS discipline was reviewed. This revealed that many crises are caused by lack of appropriate knowledge development and sharing in research and education. Knowledge management research was then reviewed and synthesized to create a comprehensive framework for identifying impediments to knowledge transfer in a university setting. Findings – The findings of the literature review indicates that lack of knowledge management and sharing is one main contributor to the crises in IS discipline. The model developed in the present study will only be tested in the next phase of this research. Practical implications – IS departments can use this framework to identify the impediments to knowledge sharing contributing to crises in research and teaching. Originality/value – This paper adopts an approach used in other disastrous situations to resolve the crises in the IS discipline. It is established in literature that most crises arise due to the lack of proper knowledge management. A framework to examine knowledge transfer impediments in IS discipline is therefore proposed. Two theoretical perspectives to knowledge transfer (i.e. the epistemological and ontological) are combined whereby impediments to tacit and explicit knowledge transfer in the areas of research and teaching, and at various social interaction levels (i.e. individual, group, organizational and inter/organizational levels) can be examined. This provides a more comprehensive analysis of the crisis situation and facilitates the development of holistic knowledge/based solutions needed to respond to the crises. Departments can use the framework to identify critical issues requiring urgent attention or specific needs of individuals, groups, etc. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2010","2025-07-25 13:43:13","2025-07-25 13:43:13","","161-173","","2","12","","J.

There has been an increase in the number of people with dementia and as the proportion of people aged over 75 years continues to rise, this will increase still further. The Scottish Government has produced a dementia strategy and implementing this will be a challenge for rural Scotland. Methods: Transferring academic knowledge into practice is challenging. A Knowledge Transfer Partnership was formed between NHS Highland and the University of Stirling. A literature review was undertaken of the rural dementia literature; local services were surveyed and described; and interviews were undertaken with people with dementia and carers. Work was conducted on training, diagnostic service provision and local policy. Throughout the project, a collaborative approach was used, which aimed at the joint production of knowledge. Results: Involving University staff in local service development had a substantial impact. Reviewing existing research knowledge and setting it in the context of local services, and of experience of service use, allowed the relevant priorities to be identified. As well as identifying training needs and providing training, the work influenced local decisions on diagnostic service design and standards, and on policy. Conclusion: This embedded engagement model appeared to produce more rapid change than traditional models of use of academic knowledge. © C Stark, A Innes, P Szymczynska, L Forrest, K Proctor, 2013.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-26 14:56:23","","","","1","13","","Rural Remote Health","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: James Cook University","","","","article; health care quality; human; education; Humans; Knowledge transfer; United Kingdom; clinical competence; Clinical Competence; Community Mental Health Services; cooperation; Cooperative Behavior; dementia; Dementia; Diffusion of Innovation; Embedded engagement; health; health care personnel; health care policy; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Joint production of knowledge; manpower; mass communication; mental health service; methodology; MLCS; MLOWN; National Health Programs; organization and management; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); patient care; Patient Care Team; Pilot Projects; pilot study; practice guideline; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Program Evaluation; public health; Research use; Rural Health; Rural health services; rural population; Rural population; Rural Population; Scotland; standard; Translational Medical Research; translational research; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study examines the role of absorptive and desorptive capacity (A/DCAP) of actors in technology transfer processes by pointing out critical elements that may affect regional innovation systems. In this field of action, each university worldwide, as well as public and private research centers, interacts differently with industry. Cultural and economic variances make it difficult to outline one single global model governing knowledge and technology transfer. However, it is possible to identify elements and characteristics that might make this system efficient. Mere interaction is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to ensure that knowledge and technology flow through a feasible dyadic channel from university to industry (U-I) or vice versa (I-U). Indeed, the actors of the process have to develop organizational capabilities at all levels and units (i.e., individual and organizational) based on a social integration system which can facilitate their communication, thus helping to share activities. In this regard, we present a systematic review of research into academic involvement in the regional innovation development environment by identifying individual as well as organizational and institutional layers of this cross-relationship. Apart from being more widely applied, A/DCAP is strictly important for academics in order to access resources and results able to support their research agendas. © 2015, Dell’Anno and del Giudice.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","","","1","4","","J.

The central assumption is that translation theory is not only useful for analyzing knowledge-transfer processes, but also has the potential to guide deliberate interventions in such processes. Based on this premise, and drawing on insights from the neighboring academic discipline of translation studies, the author outlines the elements of an instrumental translation theory, with the aim of developing knowledge about how to conduct translations of practices and ideas to achieve various organizational ends in knowledge transfers. The instrumental theory is founded on two main arguments. The first is that knowledge transfers between organizations are rule-based translation processes. The second is that the way in which translators use various translation rules and perform translations may be decisive for outcomes of knowledge-transfer processes. This study develops a typology of three translation modes (the reproducing, the modifying and the radical mode) and four appurtenant translation rules (copying, addition, omission and alteration), and discusses which translation rules fit which conditions. The author identifies three critical conditional variables in knowledge transfers – the translatability of the source practice, the transformability of the transferred knowledge, and the similarity between source and recipient units – and discusses the appropriateness of each translation rule in relation to these variables. © 2016 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-26 14:48:58","","290-310","","3","18","","Int.

Utilizing Mintzberg's organizational model and its discussion of organizational placement and legitimacy as a conceptual framework, this study explores the current copyright education structures among the universities that comprise the Consortium on Institutional Cooperation, otherwise known as the CIC or the Big Ten, to determine whether organizational placement, credentials of individuals, and resources devoted to this activity affect the legitimacy of the office and the authority of copyright officers to fulfill their responsibilities.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model for studying and better understanding the creation, diffusion, and sustaining of organizational innovations by using a system perspective. The three concepts “creation,” “diffusion,” and “sustaining” are highly intertwined and should not be explored in isolation, as organizational innovations are constantly being re-invented. The model for catalyzing organizational development and change could be visualized as five steps that form a circular pattern around an organizational-specific and path-dependent improvement trajectory rather than a single organizational innovation. The five steps are influenced by the external context, the internal environment, and the characteristics of the innovation itself. Further, different diffusion channels such as consultants, universities, and standardization forums function as mechanisms for knowledge transfer and triggering one or several of the five steps. The model is developed based on two literature reviews conducted over a 14-year period and findings from two empirical studies covering four Swedish manufacturing firms and one hospital. The model proposed here has already been used in practice in a study for the Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA. Likewise the model proved to be useful in analyzing both similarities and differences between different national programs for catalyzing organizational development. This comprehensive model, we suggest, has a wider and more general use and is applicable across the Triple Helix model. © 2015 Steiber and Alänge.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","","","1","2","","Triple Helix","组织创新:在迅速变化的世界催化组织发展与变化的一个综合模型摘 要","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers","","","","Model; Creation; Diffusion; Organizational development; Organizational innovation; Sustaining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decisions of universities and public institutions regarding the transfer of knowledge impact the accessibility of the final product, making it easier or more difficult for consumers to access these products. In the case of medical research, these products are pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, or medical procedures. The ethical dimension of access to these potentially lifesaving products is apparent and distinguishes the transfer of medical knowledge from the transfer of knowledge in other areas. While the general field of technology transfer from academic and public to private actors is attracting an increasing amount of scholarly attention, the specifications of knowledge transfer in the medical field are not as well explored. This review seeks to provide a systematic overview and analysis of the qualitative literature on the characteristics and determinants of knowledge transfer in medical research and development. Methods: The review systematically searches the literature for qualitative studies that focus on knowledge transfer characteristics and determinants at medical academic and public research institutions. It aims at identifying and analyzing the literature on the content and context of knowledge transfer policies, decision-making processes, and actors at academic and public institutions. The search strategy includes the databases PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, and DiVa. These databases will be searched based on pre-specified search terms. The studies selected for inclusion in the review will be critically assessed for their quality utilizing the Qualitative Research Checklist developed by the Clinical Appraisal Skills Programme. Data extraction and synthesis will be based on the meta-ethnographic approach. Discussion: This review seeks to further the understanding of the kinds of transfer pathways that exist in medical knowledge transfer as well as what factors lead to the adoption of one pathway over another. The aim is to provide evidence for political and academic actors designing policies for the translation of medical knowledge and public-private cooperation.

It is evident that human measurement and classification of the human body based on size and shape are precedent to accurate clothing fit and therefore fundamental to production and consumption. With advancement in technology, automated 3D body scanners designed to capture the shape and size of a human body in seconds and further produce its true-to-scale 3D body model have been developed. The use of data generated is extensive; and include anthropometric dimensions and morphology for the creation of avatars and mannequins. This technology is currently viewed as the frontier in solving fit problems, for instance by generating accurate data for the development of size charts, enabling a pragmatic approach to the offer of mass customisation and also facilitating virtual model fit trials that enhance online clothing shopping experiences. Consumers have become savvier than ever and as the demand for well-fitted garments is increasing, 3D body scanning technology is being viewed as a significant bridge between craftsmanship and computer-aided design technologies. Currently being explored by academic research and not as yet widely implemented across retail sectors, it is expected to facilitate consumer satisfaction and reduce commercial waste due to 'ill-fit' returns. There is therefore a vital need to authenticate procedures and establish systems for practice. This paper seeks to assess the application of one such technology to human measurement for clothing provision and tests procedures for its implementation. The methodology presents a case study approach involving the use of one such state-of-the-art technology in the acquisition of measurement data at a metropolitan university in the UK, and advises on the application of the 3D body scanner in research and sampling activities.","2010","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","","","7","4","","Int.

Yet, relatively little is known about the emergence and evolution of infrastructures in former colonies. Until a decade ago, most historical studies followed Daniel Headrick’s (1981) “tools of empire” thesis, painting—with broad brush strokes—a picture of infrastructures as instruments for advancing the colonial project of exploitation and subordination of non-European peoples and environments. This paper explores new research perspectives beyond this straightforward, ‘diffusionist’ perspective on technology transfer. In order to do so, it presents and discusses more recent studies which focus on interactive transfer processes as well as mechanisms of appropriation, and which increasingly combine approaches from imperial history, environmental history, and history of technology. There is much to gain from unpacking the changing motives and ideologies behind technology transfer; tracing the often contested and negotiated flows of ideas, technologies and knowledge within multilayered global networks; investigating the manifold ways in which infrastructures reflected and (re)produced colonial spaces and identities; critically reflecting on the utility of large (socio)technical systems (LTS) for the Global South; and approaching infrastructures in the (post)colonial world through entangled histories of technology and the environment. Following David Arnold’s (2005) plea for a “more interactive, culturally-nuanced, multi-sited debate” on technology in the non-Western world, the paper offers fresh insights for a broader debate about how infrastructures work within specific parameters of time, place and culture. © 2017, Springer International Publishing.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","355-391","","4","24","","NTM Int.

Despite such large and rapidly growing investment figures, the success rates of IT deployment projects over the past 20 years remained relatively low: approximately half of IT deployment projects were unsuccessful. Literature review reveals that inadequate strategic information system planning (SISP) is one of the main reasons for low deployment success rates of IT deployment projects and, thus, one of the current critical IT management issues. For this reason researchers and practitioners in the SISP field are currently directing their efforts into expanding the traditional understanding of SISP as a pure IT planning activity. In addition to the activities dedicated to the planning of IT investments, new SISP models should also include the contextual activities that enable adaptation of the deployed IT to the environment and knowledge transfer from the environment. In this paper, the authors propose an extended SISP model that includes influences of environmental stakeholders. The developed SISP model was empirically tested on a sample from the population of 1000 largest enterprises in Slovenia. The authors believe that the findings of their research and the suggested extended SISP model will improve understanding of SISP success factors in enterprises and consequently enable them to manage their IT investments with greater success. © 2013 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-26 14:44:09","","465-488","","3","19","","Technol.

The principal objective of the HealthGrid conference and of the HealthGrid Association is the exchange and debate of ideas, technologies, solutions and requirements that interest the grid and the life-science communities and are likely to promote the integration of grids into biomedical research and health in the broadest sense. Participation is encouraged for grid middle-ware and healthgrid application developers, biomedical and health informatics users, ethicists and security experts, and policy makers to participate in a set of multidisciplinary sessions with a common focus on bringing healthgrids closer to real application in the health domain. HealthGrid conferences have been organized on an annual basis. The first conference, held in 2003 in Lyon (http://lyon2003.healthgrid.org), reflected the need to involve all actors - physicians, scientists and technologists - who might play a role in the application of grid technology to health, whether healthcare or biomedical research. The second conference, held in Clermont-Ferrand in January 2004 (http://clermont2004.healthgrid.org) reported on the earliest efforts in research, mainly work in progress, from a large number of projects. The third conference in Oxford (http://oxford2005.healthgrid.org) had a major focus on first results and exploration of deployment strategies in healthcare. The fourth conference in Valencia (http://valencia2006.healthgrid.org) aimed at consolidating the collaboration among biologists, healthcare professionals and grid technology experts. The fifth conference in Geneva (http://geneva2007. healthgrid.org) focused on the five domains defined by the European Commission as application areas for 'vertical integration' through grids in the biomedical field: molecules, cells, organs, individuals, and populations. For each of these five domains, an invited speaker gave a state of the art address followed by concrete projects. This was a loud signal to the community that the usefulness of grids to potential application domains could be demonstrated at least at the prototype level. This theme was also evident at the sixth conference in Chicago (http://chicago2008.healthgrid.org), which proclaimed its focus as 'e-Science Meets Biomedical Informatics'. The sixth conference was also a landmark in the history of the organisation HealthGrid - and its newly established affiliate HealthGrid.US - as the first conference to be organised outside Europe. As we put it at the time, this was a celebration of similarities and differences, a moment to validate models and principles beyond one's familiar shores. The seventh conference returned to Europe, taking place for the first time in Germany in Berlin (http://berlin2009.healthgrid.org). While most themes touched on in earlier conferences continued to be present, certain other themes came to the fore perhaps more clearly than ever before: accessibility, the fraught challenge of usability, and the question of a business case for healthgrids. Ethical, legal, social and economic issues are sometimes encapsulated in the acronym ELSE, with the wry joke that we would like ""someone else"" to take care of them; perhaps more clearly than before, the Berlin conference embraced and debated these issues directly. Along with these, a hint of 'cloud' also hovered over the discussion of core technologies - and a less metaphorical cloud burst over the open-air conference dinner to refresh participants. While the desire to promote healthgrid applications to real healthcare settings remains central to the community's ambitions, it is also true that the majority of adopters work in academic environments where research is their principal preoccupation. Judging from the full range of papers submitted this year, cloud computing appears set to make an impact, just when healthcare informatics appears readier to adopt that paradigm, perhaps in preference to grids. So it may turn out that grids will remain the infrastructure of choice for research and clouds for (the business of) healthcare. Conference at Orsay, Paris, 2010 The call for papers issued in January resulted in 42 submissions; after a review process in which all papers were read by two independent reviewers as well as at least one, sometimes two members of the Steering Committee, 19 papers were accepted for full presentation. In addition, several papers described work that is still at an early stage and not yet ready for presentation as a full paper, or presented work of considerable scientific merit but which had not yet been fully implemented in a grid. These were considered worthy of inclusion in the conference as posters and, in a shorter form, in the proceedings. Section One - Socio-Economic Aspects and Accessibility Xin Zhou et al. conducted an extensive survey of opinion about grids in the public sector. Among the significant findings were discrepancies between expectations of users and administrators, hinting at an inherent tension in the concept of grids as a means of full exploitation of resources. Hanene Rahmouni's report of semi-automated compliance checking, extending her earlier work on the SHARE project, leads to an optimistic picture suggesting that technology and the dread 'ELSE' issues are not entirely at odds. Yassene Mohammed and colleagues consider the means of technology and knowledge transfer in the grid world. They discuss the players, problems and media at work in the process of technology adoption among life scientists. Their analysis examines in particular the medium of exchange (including, e.g., newly trained user experts) and explores various explanatory paradigms of technology transfer. Femida Gawdry-Sridhar and Silvia Olabarriaga with co-authors compare developments in Canada and in the Netherlands in the light of the vision of the HealthGrid 'white paper' broad road maps of the SHARE project. They find grounds for optimism but also identify similar obstacles and resistances on both sides. Section Two - Future of Grids, Core Technologies & Data Integration Adam Kraut and colleagues compared clouds vs clusters in an 'embarrassingly parallel' biomedical application. This is justified on the grounds of compute-intensity of the application, but judged on usability and performance. This should certainly be a good challenge for the cloud paradigm; the results are somewhat unfavourable. TRENCADIS, which will be familiar to readers of this series, was originally built with a Service-Oriented Architecture. It has now been ported by Ignacio Blanquer et al. to gLite using features of DICOM Structured Reports and ontologies to integrate data from diverse imaging and associated data. Reporting from ACGT, Garcia, Karlsson and Trelles describe a catalog of service metadata to support discovery and integration of services. Their approach nicely highlights trade-offs between expressiveness and ease of discovery and composition. Ashiq Anjum et al. explore the proposed reuse of a highly sophisticated database designed to track the construction of a CERN experiment as a provenance engine in the neuGRID project. Benbelgacem, Niimaki and Abdennadher extend the work previously reported in 2008 on healthgrid adoption and adaptation of XtremWeb-CH and lead through these developments to the release of a new infrastructure, XWCH2. A large collaboration from the NeuroLOG project report on its data management layer and their successful federation of neuroimaging data. This has allowed them to achieve semantically tight integration of data from diverse, loosely coupled sources. The Décrypthon project has established a grid infrastructure for biomedical applications. Although the authors' focus was on the technology (middleware, query language) they illustrate it with a valuable application to neuromuscular disorders. Paul de Vlieger et al. report on an application that was foreseen even in the HealthGrid 'white paper' as one of the founding challenges for healthgrids. The idea is to integrate diverse, geographically distributed databases so as to be able to derive meaningful epidemiological information from the base data, in this case from various cancer screening programmes. Finally in this section, David Ritchie et al report on the use of special processors for certain biomedical tasks. In particular, the already efficient Hex protein docking algorithm turns out to run significantly faster on graphics processor units. This has certain interesting implications for technology choices in specialist grids for biomedical research. Section Three - Applications A team from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin report on the increasing need for imaging in liver disease. Segmentation of MRI images is sufficiently complex to justify use of a grid. The results are compared with an expert's segmentation. Lessons are also drawn for further innovation in healthgrids. Hausmann, Knoch et al. describe GLOBE 3D Genome Platform an interactive collaboration grid platform for the analysis and visualization of results from their novel COMBO-FISH method of labelling genomic sequences. Jason Haga and team from California and Japan began their work with the observation of inconsistencies in virtual screening using DOCK on a heterogeneous grid. They experimented with virtualization to overcome heterogeneity and show that variability in results is much reduced. This work again raises the issue of clouds. Arun Datta and colleagues describe a grid-based epidemiological application integrating information for childhood obesity surveillance. This is an increasingly pressing problem in better off nations. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press.

Due to this a new test facility, a so called Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) test facility, for PPTs at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at University of Stuttgart is developed. The test stand is based on existing measuring instruments as well as know-how gathered during the long-term development and investigation of PPTs at IRS, i.e. ADD SIMPLEX, PETRA and PET. The HIL facility is distinguished by being compact, modular and extensible for future experiments enabling a characterization of miniature PPTs and Pulsed Electrothermal Thrusters (PET) in the energy range of some Joules. Main basis for the test stand is an already existing and well proven micro Newton thrust pendulum. In order to set up the HIL facility the pendulum is equipped with several measuring instruments to receive thruster specific performance data, i.e. thrust, capacitor's discharge current and voltage as well as magnetic field data of the plasma plume. Additionally, high speed imaging of the plasma plume will be performed. To investigate the thruster's behavior at different capacitances, capacitors can be disabled or engaged during test campaigns enabling, e.g. investigation of a complete or temporally failure of capacitors during a mission. The development of the HIL facility is in close connection to the new development thruster PETRUS (Pulsed Electric Thruster of the University of Stuttgart). PETRUS is a coaxial, PTFE based, low energy thruster designed and optimized for CubeSat applications like ""CubeSat Atmospheric Probe for Education"" (CAPE). As PPTs are characterized by a simple design and a high reliability, PETRUS shall be used as a primary propulsion system performing a controlled de-orbit maneuver. Furthermore, the modular design of PETRUS allows the investigation of thermal and magnetodynamic effects by using different attachments, e.g. nozzle or cylindrical acceleration path making it possible to: 1) verify or improve present simulation models and 2) investigate scaling laws of PPTs. This paper describes the development of a state-of-the-art HIL test facility characterizing low energy PPTs and PETs. Moreover, a new PPT based thruster (PETRUS) for CubeSat applications is introduced which is tested and characterized by using the HIL facility.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","","","","0","","","","","","","","International Astronautical Federation, IAF","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Traditionally, engineering analysis in commercial nuclear power applications has lacked detailed uncertainty analysis and quantification. Instead, ""worst case"" or credible extremes are evaluated separately. Where uncertainty has been evaluated [16, 17], it is not clearly related to risk or scenario importance. Quantification of risk and uncertainty is a basic need in a risk-informed regulatory paradigm. The risk-informed pilot project developed and used a new integrative approach, which could be more suitable in the risk-informed regulatory setting. More specifically, in this project (a) underlying physical and chemical models for the post-LOCA PRA basic events, associated with the concerns raised in GSI-191, were developed outside the PRA and (b) uncertainties were propagated in the physical models in order to have their results ready to be incorporated into PRA. The probabilities of the basic events (and their associated uncertainties), as they were obtained from the models of the underlying physical and chemical phenomena, were then incorporated into PRA. The uncertainties in the probabilities of basic events were also propagated through the PRA scenarios. The risk-informed pilot project is unique in some aspects such as it : (1) advances the PRA methodologies and applications by the integration of underlying physical and chemical phenomena, (2) presents the state-of-the art integration of probabilistic methods (e.g., uncertainty analysis, statistical analysis, risk analysis) and deterministic techniques (e.g., experimental testing, computer-aided design, and computational fluid dynamics), and (3) arose from collaborative work by teams of experts from industry and academia. The risk-informed project started in academia, but without private sector industry support, practical implementation would not have been possible. The utility and, particularly, its staff members assigned to solve the problem, maintained close relationships with the academic faculty, making it possible to react quickly to challenging research needs and to search for scientific and practical solutions. It is absolutely essential to understand how to incorporate practical experience from industrial practitioners in a project like the pilot project in order to produce a truly implementable program that can be an on-going operating experience. The progress of the research and its implementation have also significantly benefitted from the discussions and feedback received from regulatory representatives. The methodology used in the pilot project can be applied for other risk-informed projects related to nuclear power plants. Some of the authors are currently proposing to apply a similar methodology to fire PRA [18] and seismic PRA [19]. Another important area is the incorporation of underlying safety culture and organizational factors into risk-informed regulation. One of the authors has worked in this area of research [20] and, is advancing the benefits for applications to the nuclear power industry.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","1906-1909","","","109","","","","","","","","American Nuclear Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: PART 2 Journal Abbreviation: Trans Am Nucl Soc","","","","Research; Technology transfer; Risk management; Models; Computer aided design; Computational fluid dynamics; Deterministic technique; Embedded systems; Industrial practitioners; Integration testing; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear industry; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear-power industry; Organizational factors; Probabilistic methods; Risk and uncertainty; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risk-informed decision making; Risk-informed regulation; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the country’s science and technology policy through its main program, the National System of Researchers (SNI), an attempt made for the first time. The results obtained make it possible to see whether the SNI has succeeded in improving research in Mexico. The authors also look at whether the program provides ways of improving and strengthening the science policy model adopted by Mexico and whether it could be extended and/or introduced into other nearby countries with levels of development or characteristics similar to those of Mexico. Design/methodology/approach – After that, the authors will analyze the scientific productivity of SNI members in comparison to Mexican researchers as a whole so as to assess both whether the SNI selects the best researchers and whether these researchers carry out more research and of a higher quality. Finally, the authors will check whether the selection criteria of the assessment committees are internally consistent. To do this, the authors will carry out a bibliometric analysis of Mexican scientific production (overall and specifically of SNI members) and an analysis of the groups of researchers belonging to the SNI. Findings – The aim of this paper is to discover the impact and importance of the best program in Mexico as regards research policy, known as the SNI. Analyzing it will, in short, enable the authors to detect whether the program has been of use in improving the investigation potential and capacity for science and technology transfer of the research elite in Mexico; check whether the levels assigned to these researchers within the SNI are justified, based on research indicators (inputs and outputs); and assess the pros and cons of the SNI program with an eye to reviewing it in Mexico. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of using cross-sectional data is that information is not the same in each period analyzed. However, the SNI of Mexico has used the same information in all its evaluations. Therefore, the authors believe that using longitudinal data allows us to compare the evolution of SNI for various periods. This certainly is helpful for making decisions and, above all, provides first-hand information to the authorities who, in turn, should strengthen and make more efficient remedial measures regarding public policies on science and technology in Mexico. Practical implications – SNI assessment program will know the science and technology of Mexico and whether it is advisable to implement this program of science policy in similar economies or the same level of development as Mexico. Social implications – The contributions of this study are relevant to the extent that the evaluation system of researchers from Mexico is the basis for allocating research resources, making proposals to help improve the system for evaluating researchers and contributing to efficiency in the allocation of resources for research. Originality/value – This paper has also applied different techniques that have made it possible to look more thoroughly into the classification of all the researchers who were assessed positively by the SNI for period 1996-2003. These techniques have enabled us to obtain alternative classifications based on statistical algorithms and to gauge the level of internal consistency of the classifications made by the SNI, based strictly on the quantitative information supplied. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","101-131","","1","7","","J.

Design/methodology/approach: Through building on literature studies and management best practice, formulation of the performance measurement system was explored. The Balanced Scorecard solution was then designed and implemented at a university institute. Benefits and outcomes are discussed through reflective analysis of the case study investigation. Findings: The study identified how the development of scorecard reports that include economic and non-economic measures can improve the operational management of a university institute through providing tangible benefits to stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The scorecard was investigated at an industry-supported university institute and so features of the scorecard design and implementation may be less relevant to other types of organisations. Practical implications: This research paper provides details on how the scorecard has been modified to provide an accessible and durable measurement system. The paper includes specific guidance for practitioners who are considering implementing the scorecard. Social implications: The role of intellectual capital and soft measures as systemic determinants of performance is discussed and this is viewed in terms of university-industry collaborations. Originality/value: A comprehensive literature review underpins a two-year research project involving strategy mapping, design and implementation of the Balanced Scorecard. Advice on modification of the scorecard and provision of representative data and information from reports serve to further the scorecard research agenda. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","34-45","","3","15","","Measuring Bus.

Ideally, these decisions should be based on objective consideration and empirical evidence, but they are frequently based on an owner's level of comfort or prior experience. Due to the importance of making informed decisions, several academic studies have investigated the relationship between project performance and potential predictive variables including delivery method, contract type and procurement strategy. Many of these earlier studies have begun losing relevancy in a changing industry, through the introduction of new concepts such as team integration, teaming tools, building information modeling (BIM) and sustainable design. To address this growing knowledge gap, a study was conducted to: (1) identify key project success criteria from the owner's perspective; (2) determine suitable metrics for reliably measuring performance outcomes related to the established success criteria; and (3) consider new concepts such as project integration, BIM, team behavior and sustainability. The research team conducted an extensive literature review on studies exploring the relationship between project delivery and outcomes to generate a comprehensive listing of statistically relevant predictors of success and tested performance metrics. Validation of this compiled listing was performed through an advisory board of industry experts. The advisory board provided critical feedback and assisted in the development a survey instrument for collecting project-specific data. The results of this study will enhance our current understanding of project success criteria and tracking metrics to support decision-making processes. More importantly, it provides a basis for further study, data collection and the creation of a project performance database.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","574-583","","","1","","","","","","","","Canadian Society for Civil Engineering","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: January Journal Abbreviation: Proc Annu Conf Can Soc Civ Eng","","","","Technology transfer; Sustainable development; Architectural design; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction projects; Critical success factor; Data acquisition; Decision making; Decision making process; Measuring performance; Predictive variables; Procurement strategy; Project management; Project success criteria","","Katsanis C.J.; Bedard C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings, Annual Conference - Canadian Society for Civil Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Triple Helix concept of knowledge generation and innovation introduces triadic relationships between government, academia and industry. These often incorporate state driven aims of innovation development and diffusion for greater societal and economic benefit as conditions of the funding programmes. This concept is witnessed in the UK low carbon energy innovation system, where collaborative relationships are formed to develop new technologies for application by industry and society. The dynamics of the Triple Helix model bring many challenges to policy makers and those engaged in knowledge transfer relationships, stemming from the inherent nature of knowledge and the complex human interactions involved with inter-organisational knowledge transfer. Low carbon innovation has an increased need for inter-disciplinary knowledge transfer where specialised pools of knowledge are brought together for the purposes of innovation, in environments typified by uncertainty and unclear user impacts. Obstacles are compounded by the complexity of defining knowledge transfer processes and the debate surrounding the transferability of knowledge. Significant additional challenges exist within low carbon innovation, where influencing technology adoption by the public is seen as a multifaceted problem with no easy solution and requires innovation outputs to be transformed to societal outcomes. This paper aims to explore the nature of these challenges through a review of the literature on knowledge transfer, the continuing transition of academia, government and industry within knowledge generation frameworks and the specific dilemmas faced by the low carbon innovation system. This literature review provides a foundation for future research which aims to explore the concept of knowledge transfer within the UK low carbon innovation system and gather empirical data pertaining to the optimisation of collaborative project performance.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","953-960","","","0","","","","","","","","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Several countries like Korea, Taiwan and Spain have created STPs as a regional development strategy. In Spain almost half of the universities own STPs. Due to its importance for regional development STPs researches have been directed to explore the effects on factors performance such as Leadership, Strategy, Relations with higher education institutions and other knowledge generators, management, facilities management, staff and organizational structure, development stage and management. Previous analyses refers parks in developed countries and they are in mature development stages. The phenomenon of STPs in Colombia arises in the late 90s and their most development stage of its parks is incubation stage. Colombian STPs have not had a typical development process and the lessons learned of their development have had low levels of documentation in the scientific literature. In this paper, we report our experience in analysis of lessons learned of Colombian STP development process and includes lessons deriving depth analysis of the experiences of the Antioquia and Guatiguará parks. This search is oriented on mixed research approach and the case study methodology was selected due to the emerging nature of the subject within the scientific literature and limited information about the Colombian STPs. This work is a multiple case study based on the five STPs recognized by Colombian STPs Policy. Colombian STPs are surveyed in order to identify lessons learned and the survey was based on written questionnaires followed by semi-structured phone interviews to each park top managers. Interviews include STPs founders, managers and consultants involved in the development of feasibility studies of Colombian STPs projects and initiatives. This multiple case study considers the application of the following techniques: (i) written questionnaires, (ii) semi-structured interviews (iii) content analysis and (iv) structural analysis. Results include a literature review-based description of lessons learned, and the lessons effects on Colombian STPs' development from their leaders' perspective. There were reported more than 22 lessons learned reported by the administration of the surveyed STPs. However in this work we present only the 11 lessons that we verified by interviews and visits. We classify identified lessons according to previously identified factors. The discussion of the results contrasts lessons identified in Colombian STPs versus those reported in other countries.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","175-188","","","","","","","","","","","International Association for Management of Technology Conference (IAMOT) and the Graduate School of Technology Management, University of Pretoria","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IAMOT -  Int.

In this article, based on an extensive literature review, the authors argue that champions display four behaviors, namely (1) pursuing innovative ideas, (2) network building, (3) persisting under adversity, and (4) taking responsibility for the idea. The authors use data from 123 university spin-offs to test proposed linear and curvilinear relationships between the four behaviors and an objective measure of innovation success, namely a longitudinal measure of sales growth. The results indicate that network building has the desired positive relationship with sales performance. Surprisingly, pursuing the innovative idea is not related to sales growth. Furthermore, the present study also reveals some dysfunctional effects of champion behaviors. Persisting under adversity and taking responsibility have the hypothesized inverted-U relationship with sales growth. The present study provides a more refined discussion of the benefits and dangers of championing behaviors. Our results show that linking technology to markets can be planned and controlled only to a very limited extent even if champions are working hard to sell the idea to potential customers. Moreover, any new idea is often competing with existing products and pursuing such ideas may result in opposition to the idea. In contrast, network building has the desired positive relationship with innovation success. Effective championing behavior keeps an innovative idea alive by mobilizing support and building coalitions around the idea with critical individuals or important third parties. Moreover, this study challenges the widespread ""heroic"" discussion of championing as fundamentally positive ""across the board."" The results show that persisting under adversity and taking responsibility are desirable up to some levels. Beyond such critical levels, these two champion behaviors may actually become detrimental to the innovation process. Being too persistent in the face of adversity or taking too much responsibility for the innovative idea might undermine the power of the champion's justifications for an innovation and thereby increase resistance to change. An ""over-performing"" champion may interpret opposing communications as an unwarranted and injurious response. By taking overmuch responsibility for the innovative undertaking, the champion is likely to discourage contributions from other team members who see no valuable opportunity to bring their expertise and knowledge to the idea. © 2011 Product Development & Management Association.","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-26 14:56:46","","586-598","","4","28","","J.

Given TCs’ main function, most authors present an industrial perspective of their performance. However, the bibliometric techniques can offer not only an overview of these centres, but also additional information about their features: the evolution of their publications, the degree of national and international collaboration, the Spanish institutional sectors and the main disciplines involved, the regional differences and their connections. In this article, Spanish TCs’ documents downloaded from the Web of Science (2008–2012) are analysed, along with other indicators that can characterise these centres. The results show that national collaboration is important for TCs and even more when those links are local. This is in line with that stated by other authors, considering that geographical proximity is essential for knowledge transfer. Regarding the Spanish institutional sectors, the strongest relations are established with universities. For their part, firms have low participation in publications, although they show an upward trend over the years. Nevertheless, TCs’ documents are mainly issued on industrial related topics, in agreement with their primary mission as promoters of firms’ innovation. Finally, as expected, differences between regions’ performance are seen, explained in part by disparities between regional systems. Notwithstanding, top producers establish connections with regions without TCs, mainly collaborating in documents related to engineering, medicine and environmental topics. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","685-713","","3","104","","Scientometrics","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","Performance evaluation; Collaboration; Regional differences; Scientific publications; Spanish Technology Centres; Statistical analyses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the entrepreneurial university boosts economic and social development by encouraging academic entrepreneurship among faculty members. Although research on the entrepreneurial university has increased considerably in recent years, there are as yet no conceptual syntheses of the literature and there is an absence of a holistic framework covering the range of factors required to promote academic entrepreneurship within the entrepreneurial university paradigm. This gap is addressed by identifying the determining factors in an entrepreneurial university and synthesizing them into an integrative framework, based on the corporate entrepreneurship research stream: the determining factors are divided into three groups – external, internal and strategic. This framework is based on a qualitative review of theoretical and empirical studies of entrepreneurial universities and an analysis of diverse frameworks and models. The paper thus provides a systematic overview that allows for consolidation of the literature on entrepreneurial universities, while drawing important implications from research and suggesting potential paths for future study. © 2014, © 2014 SAGE Publications.","2014","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-26 15:26:28","","233-244","","4","28","","Ind.

The region is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean and includes these countries: Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The last two countries are the most developed. Panama is widening the canal and constructing thousands of new buildings and financial areas. Costa Rica has the largest microchip plant in the world (Intel) and competes internationally for high-technology industries (HP, Dell, pharmaceuticals, etc.) and service companies. Research and specifications for asphalt materials were very limited until the year 2000. The reason was that each country reduced their efforts in adopting AASHTO specifications for penetration and viscosity graded asphalt. The Marshall Design procedure was the only methodology used for designing hot-mix asphalt (HMA). The turning point for the asphalt industry was in 2000 when the Central American Manual for Highway and Bridge Construction (CA 2000) adopted the PG grading system and the Superpave method as an option for asphalt binder selection and HMA design. Additionally, in 2002, Costa Rica devoted one-percent of the fuel tax to perform applied research, project auditing, and technology transfer through the Transportation Infrastructure Program (PITRA) of the National Laboratory of Materials of the University of Costa Rica (LanammeUCR). This decision allowed the development of a state-of-the-art laboratory and inviting back to the country Master and PhD graduates to perform the mentioned activities. Today, LanammeUCR has all the Superpave equipment for binders and mixtures, dynamic devices for mechanical characterization of HMA (dynamic modulus, flow number, Hamburg wheel track, Asphalt Pavement Analyzer, beam fatigue), and equipment for materials characterization ranging from nano-scale (AFM, TGA, DSC, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy) to full-scale (a heavy-vehicle simulator, HVS). This investment in equipment and training of personnel made LanammeUCR the regional laboratory for this area. The most important current research lines are focused on developing specifications and material analysis representative of the tropical weather conditions and the weak soil foundation characteristic of the region. Examples of these research projects are: 1) calibration of the Witczak model for Central America's HMA mixtures; 2) development of a new moisture damage test for tropical weather; 3) adaptation of chip and slurry seals for local conditions; 4) nano-characterization of neat and modified asphalt binders; 5) development of fatigue and rutting models for HMA mixtures; and, 6) the most ambitious project, to develop an empirical-mechanistic pavement design guide for the CA region.","2012","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","807-829","","","81","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Asphalt Paving Technol","","","","Research; Technology transfer; Transportation infrastructures; Design; Asphalt; Asphalt pavement analyzers; Asphalt pavements; Binders; Bridges; Calibration; Characterization; Equipment; High technology industries; Hma testing; HVS; Local calibration; Materials characterization; Mechanical characterizations; MEPDG; Mixtures; Performance testing; Personnel training; Raman spectroscopy; Specifications; Superpave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Asphalt Paving Technology: Association of Asphalt Paving Technologists-Proceedings of the Technical Sessions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior Work: The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program (EIP) is a powerful engine for expansion and for addressing societal and global challenges. The innovation drives economic growth and job creation and is of significance not only within high-tech sectors but in all economic sectors. While economists and policymakers worldwide have recognized the importance of technological innovation for growth, the relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship has been especially appreciated recently because entrepreneurs play an important role in fomenting innovation. The results are part of the ongoing research project funded by a grant by Kuwait Foundation for Advancement of Sciences (KFAS-2012-1103-01). Methodology/Approach: The methodology is based on uses a qualitative approach consisting of literature review and eight international interviews in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Results: This paper provides ranking of innovation programs and a set of guidelines and recommendations for future adaptation. Implications: This paper provides value-added knowledge for both academics and practitioners who are interested insuccessful adaptation of EIP. Value: The authors believe that this paper demonstrates an added value to the current literature on EIP and fill the gap in the case studies of developed and developing countries literature.Also, presents more comprehensive analysis of progress and challenges for practitioners including policy makers, governments, and funded organizations through the successful implementation of EIP best practices.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","25-35","","","2015-January","","","","","","","","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Industry will benefit especially in terms of innovative co-creation potential and direct recruitment channel, and the university will benefit in terms of potential hands-on research environment, real-life teaching and learning possibilities and funding opportunities for research. Yet the university-industry engagement is far from easy, due to the varying starting points, aims and modus operandi. This paper examines the role of knowledge transfer in university-industry collaboration basing on the argument that effective knowledge transfer is one of the critical success factors in the collaboration as co-learning and co-creation of value do not happen without appropriate knowledge transfer. The focus of this paper is especially on identifying the knowledge barriers that are present within knowledge networks comprising of universities and their industrial partners. Knowledge networks are networks that have been established for the purpose of knowledge exchange (Verburg and Andriessen, 2011; Nielsen, 2002; llvonen and Vuori, 2013). Universities' role in such networks is often central, as they act as creators, intermediators, nodes, facilitators and resources (Myllärniemi et al, 2013). The paper builds on Riege's (2005) classification that divides the barriers into individual, organizational and technological. All of these categories exist within university-industry knowledge networks, but they are accompanied with specific challenges arising from the different features of academia and business (e.g. non-profit vs. profit, generalisability vs. restricted use of results, long-term scientific theory building vs. quick realisation of innovations). Through the methodologies of literature review and multiple case study the paper presents the KBs that are highlighted within university-industry knowledge networks.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","952-959","","","2016-January","","","","","","","","Academic Conferences Limited","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Research Design & Methods: The article is of descriptive character, based on literature review and its constructive critics. Findings: The article presents the concept of entrepreneurial university to relate this idea to develop the accountability practices in higher education. Subsequently, the limitations of trends related to the development of the entrepreneurial university and accountability are discussed. Implications & Recommendations: Higher education is increasingly becoming a business operation, in which competition plays a key role. Accountability at universities is established to implement a specific accounting and reporting system, which is a prerequisite for the existence of this accountability and responsibility. Accounting of higher education systems is a consequence of the marketization of universities.

Methods: We describe the approach developed to adapt selected international experiences to provincial scenario. Bibliographic review, regulations examination, key informants interviews and iterative adjustments after various stages of consultation and consensus building with main local players, contribution from foreign experts, and piloting of process and instruments for ultimate fine-tuning are described. We examine final proposal in the light of new updated studies. Results: Analysis of regulations revealed that rules governing the provincial system were historically linked to administrative resolutions in relation to procurement with poor consideration to clinical, epidemiological, organizational, and health policy aspects. Key informants from hospitals, MOH, and other governmental agencies agreed on the lack of a process capable of guaranteeing a decision about health technology incorporation based on a transparent use of the best available information, ready to deal with competitive pressures. This adaptation provided a structured and explicit process (introduction, implementation, and development) as well as essential and supporting tools. Conclusions: MOH adopted the proposal for its progressive implementation while institutional evaluation capacity develops. Further studies are needed on the value placed on health technology assessment-based processes and recommendations by clinicians, managers, policy makers, and patients. © Cambridge University Press 2014.","2014","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","121-127","","1","30","","Int.

Such change occurs in the organisation during its transition to a new version of the ISO 9001:2015. Design/methodology/approach-This paper is based on a literature review and the experience of the authors and a team of international teaching and research staff, as well as on information obtained from satisfaction surveys. Findings-The actual version of the web-based Management System Role-Play Simulation (MS-RPS) considers the changes in structure and terminology of the ISO management system standards, enables the creation of a predictive strategy regarding organisational culture, minimises the negative impact of the change and helps people adapt more quickly to it. Research limitations/implications-The study is limited to the complexity of an actual system and the possible verification of empirical results. Another limitation is the measurability of any real enhancement achieved in the quality, safety and sustainability of production, as well as the business continuity and social responsibility of an organisation. Practical implications-One benefit of the training is the thorough knowledge that players within organisational management can gain in a short period. Reduced resistance to change is also stressed and the complexity and dynamism of the internal environment considered. Originality/value-MS-RPS is based on original web-based software. The primary model has been developed at the Technical University of Kosice. It was tested by students, but also by managers and other employees in several industrial organisations, as well as services, over 20 years. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-26 14:57:18","","760-773","","5","28","","TQM J.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/VtHBS?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=3nn1UdqyJMoIC060%2Fq%2FbxmiNmN4%3D","Research; Organizational change; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Sustainable development; Organizational culture; Performance evaluation; Human resource management; World Wide Web; Managers; Personnel training; ISO 9001; ISO 9001:2015; Management system; Management systems; Role play; Role-play; Simulation; Websites; Management; Product development; Leadership; Quality standards; Organizational behavior; Quality management; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 5320:Quality control; Business And Economics--Production of Goods And Services; Energy consumption; ISO 9000; ISO standards; Total quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a literature review, we distinguish between three separate network functions: (1) learning and knowledge co-creation, (2) upscaling and institutional entrepreneurship and (3) outscaling and innovation brokerage.We investigate how these different functions have been performed in the case of the Northern Frisian Woodlands (NFWs) in the Netherlands over a period of 17. years. We have constructed the two-mode affiliation networks of the actors involved in various multidisciplinary research projects and lobbying events. We have analysed these networks using Social Network Analysis and measured the participation rates, relative degrees and the main paths through time with the Search Path Node Pairs algorithm.The results show that the three functions are not evenly distributed over all participants in an innovation network. For each of these three functions there is a small group of people that form a core group of knowledge creators, institutional entrepreneurs and innovation brokers. The analysis of the main paths through these projects and events shows the close interaction between the lobbying and knowledge co-creation functions.The ability to perform more than one innovation function over a longer period of time is extremely rare, but those people who can pull this off are very important for the success of an innovation network. This paper therefore concludes that the organisers of innovation networks should take try to organise their collaboration in such a way that it becomes easier for individuals to perform multiple roles within an innovation network. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","117-128","","","115","","Agric.

Target markets are in general public sensors for UV, ozone, CO, liquids presence, e.g. in mobile devices. Or in health, sensors for the medical diagnosis (DNA, RNA, bacteria, viruses). Simple, low cost and low consumption devices are required in medical applications. In our laboratory aluminum oxide interdigitated capacitors have been developed and successfully tested on DNA hybridization test on HIV and cancer (TP-53), as well as on bacteria and humidity or condensation (integrated into a wireless breathing monitoring system), all of them showing comparable results to the state of the art using existing standard biological protocols procedures that open new opportunities for Medical Applications. For UV light based detections (UV Diode), that are ready for use, packaging must be customized. Customers are the kits fabricator to integrate our device for a fast electrical measurement (for DNA concentration, turbidity or fire detection). Our technology demonstrates high-performance CMOS integrated circuits; easy integration of special devices, sensors and MEMS; operation in harsh conditions (micro power, high-temperature, remote RF link, etc.); very low power consumption, miniaturized, wireless or high-temperature sensors for process control, monitoring and data acquisition. Furthermore, our devices deliver excellent performance compared to the state of the art. It is important to note that this article resumes some of our results from previous papers (see the references).

An entrepreneurial orientation by academia can lead to innovative and sustainable products and research mobilization which help in putting regions and nations in an advantageous position in emerging knowledge-intensive fields of economic activity. Many empirical researches focused on entrepreneurial orientation of university students, but study on antecedents and criteria of the entrepreneurial universities is scarce. The main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive criteria set for evaluation of entrepreneurial universities. In this context, environmental and internal factors of entrepreneurial universities were identified based on literature review and survey. Twelve academics and managers have participated in this study by weighing the criteria and scoring alternatives. Society, in particular, higher education institutions, and universities can use the results for creation of new businesses and spin-offs.

More precisely, it focusses on the analysis university-industry collaborations partnering for research agreements with the aim of fostering the transfer of knowledge and innovation. It analyzes the key organizational cross-cultural differences that could hinder the successful performance of these agreements from a relationship marketing (RM) perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a comprehensive literature review of organizational culture and RM, a quantitative study was carried out and a structural equation model was proposed and tested. Findings - Cross-cultural organizational differences in private-public sectors are proved to negatively influence relationship performance. Market orientation difference appears as the most significant barrier to relationship performance, followed by time orientation difference and to a lesser extent flexibility difference. Originality/value - By integrating organizational culture and RM literatures, the main contribution of this paper is the cross-cultural analysis of private-public relationships (in this case university-industry relationships) from the perspective of RM. Hence, this research will inform management seeking to develop successful public-private collaborations by enhancing their understanding of cross-cultural factors underlying relationship success and failure. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:14","2025-07-25 13:43:14","","128-157","","1","23","","Cross Cult.

(FYS) CubeSat programme carried out by the Education Office of the European Space Agency (ESA). Within the FYS framework, the ESA Education Office supports university teams to conduct the verification campaign of their CubeSat, in order to introduce them to methods and best practices commonly used in ESA and other space agency programmes, with two main objectives: first of all, offer the students an important educational opportunity to perform the verification of their satellite with the support of ESA specialists, and also of improving student teams' mission success chances. Support for the launch opportunity will be offered to those teams which demonstrate their CubeSat's flight worthiness based on the review of their design, thorough testing, and of their verification documentation. The FYS programme offers to the participating student teams the possibility to have their work supervised by ESA specialists thus facilitating knowledge transfer from experienced professionals to students. Besides, CubeSat teams are able to access state of the art test facilities for the environmental tests campaign (vibrations and thermal vacuum). FYS is structured in 4 phases: the programme started with the Flight Model (FM) integration, and will continue up to the beginning of the mission operations. The participating teams are requested to provide to ESA their CubeSat design and testing documentation, for review by ESA specialists, and must comply with the international regulations applicable to spacecraft registration and space debris mitigation guidelines. The first two phases of ""Fly Your Satellite!"" focused on the review of the design, and on the preparation and conduct of the functional and environmental test campaigns, in both laboratory and space representative conditions. Throughout the first two phases of the programme, a number of issues as well as good practices were identified in almost all aspects of CubeSat projects from project management, to technical design (including testing campaigns), to compliance with international regulations. The experience gained during FYS Phases 1 and 2 as well as the previous small satellite programmes of the Education Office, enables the authors to indicate several lessons learned that are presented in this paper, with the aim of helping student teams and professors/researchers which are considering to engage in small-satellite development projects. In particular it is aimed at those teams that are willing to develop their spacecraft taking into account aspects of ""good engineering practice"", with the intention to include in the development a suitable verification campaign of the design requirements and by such, increasing the confidence in the success of their mission.

Thereby, due to the importance of commercialisation, certain institutions are working to speed up the diffusion process and technology transfer of new technology or new products or new services. In the world of globalization, universities are required to get involved in activities to commercialize university research and innovations to industries. It’s important that all activities and organizational structures related to commercialisation of academic research should be managed in a way which should increase commercialisation with minimum negative effect on education and research. It’s also desirable that it should also improve university’s overall capacity to perform different functions. The above mentioned facts make commercialisation of academic research a big challenge for university. The most of work highlights the relevance of collaborative research, contract research, consulting and informal relationships for university – industry knowledge transfer.

Our empirical analysis is based on a sample of 91 native Chinese firms in high-tech industries. The results indicate that Chinese firms widely implement an open innovation approach to strengthen their innovative performance. These firms use: 1 technology in-licensing agreements to obtain access to technologies 2 long-term alliances with foreign partners to access state-of-the-art technologies 3 collaboration with local universities and R&D institutes to broaden their technological strengths 4 collaboration with the local industrial community to deepen their technological skills.

The main objective is to establish a framework that can be used later in empirical research, although we maintain a completely theoretical approach in this paper Design/methodology/approach: This study, which is a comprehensive framework characterized the knowledge transfer literature in family firms in terms of the factors influencing them, was developed by an extensive literature review. Findings: Based on an extensive literature review, we conclude that knowledge is best transferred when family members value the following factors: trust between family members, commitment to the family business, intergenerational relationships, intragenerational relationships, psychological ownership of the family business, successor's aspects and training, predecessor involvement in the successor training, organizational culture and relationships with Family Business Associations. Research limitations/implications: The study demonstrates the extensiveness and variety of knowledge transfer research. However there is not the same situation in family firms' field. For academics, these different factors can be used as a map for future empirical studies. Originality/value: There is a notable lack of research into knowledge practices in small and medium-sized enterprises and especially in family firms. Besides, there is a gap in the understanding of an effective way to transfer these resources across generations; actually, existing studies on knowledge management in family businesses are scarce. The main value of our paper is to fill out partially this gap.","2013","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","1216-1238","","4","9","","Intang.

Institutional theory has been critiqued for its lack of responsiveness to change, but recent developments within institutional theory such as the focus on deinstitutionalisation as an explanation of change, the role of institutional entrepreneurs and the increasing interest in institutional work facilitate exploration of change within institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors deploy a longitudinal case study which ran from 2003-2011. Data was collected via observations, semi-structured interviews and through extensive literature reviews. Findings: Via this longitudinal case study, the authors illustrate that the antecedents of deinstitution can lie in the ways by which an institution is established. In doing so, they highlight the paradoxical role potentially played by institutional entrepreneurs in that they can (unwittingly) operate as agents of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation. Their study suggests that the higher the performance imperative within a field, the more likely the institution as a generic concept will be deinstitutionalised and the more likely to be appropriated and customised in order to gain inimitability and thus competitive advantage. Finally, the authors make an additional contribution by integrating the affective aspects of institutional work to their analyses; stressing the role played by emotions. Research limitations/implications: As with many case studies, the ability to generalise from one case, however detailed, is limited. However, it provides evidence as to the paradoxical role that can be played by institutional entrepreneurs - especially in highly competitive environments. Practical implications: The study suggests that the HR function has a potential role to play with regards to institutional continuity through a focus on leader and institutional entrepreneur succession planning. Originality/value: The paper makes an original contribution by highlighting both institutional and deinstitutional work within a single case. It highlights the paradoxical nature of institutional entrepreneurs in highly competitive environments and illustrates the importance of emotion to institutional maintenance and deinstitution. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2014","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-26 14:52:29","","314-330","","2","27","","J.

The past two decades have witnessed considerable changes in the CSR field with the introduction of new voluntary CSR instruments. Organizations adopting such tools may perceive some of the existing and emerging CSR instruments as redundant or complementary. Design/methodology/approach – The relationships between the CSR instruments analysed are treated through the lenses of institutional entrepreneurship and coopetition theories. The analysis presented is based on secondary data such as literature reviews, publications and online resources and databases from the UNGC, GRI and ISO as well as personal communications with representatives of ISO, GRI and UNGC. Findings – The paper shows that from the users’ perspective, CSR instruments should not be treated as separate alternatives, but rather as complementary to each other. At the same time, organizations that set up CSR instruments have to strengthen their existing collaboration as a network, in order to contribute more effectively to sustainable development. Research limitations/implications – The use of secondary data to discuss some of the ISO 26000 diffusion trends might provide an incomplete picture but still offer interesting insights. Practical implications – This study allows to better understand the linkages, overlaps and differences between three CSR instruments: UNGC, GRI and ISO 26000. At first sight, some of these instruments may appear as redundant but our analysis point out that they complement each other. They have different goals and are useful in different parts of one organization’s CSR infrastructure. These instruments help organizations to implement different CSR tools at different stages of integrating sustainability issues into their strategies and operations. Originality/value – CSR instruments have mainly been examined separately by scholars. In contrast, this study analyses ISO 26000, UNGC and GRI as a collaborative mechanism and predicts the fit of ISO 26000 within these well-established CSR instruments. The main contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the relationships between organizations that are developing and promoting prominent CSR instruments. In addition, we apply organizational theories to our analysis as a novel perspective. This study contributes to institutional entrepreneurship theory by showing how organizations playing the role of institutional entrepreneurs may encourage the early adoption of a new CSR instrument. It also contributes to the coopetition theory by applying this approach outside the traditional business setting. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","498-526","","4","6","","Sustainability Account.

Not only is Austria a latecomer to the political science profession, but it is also home to a rather small political science community with there only being three universities which have established political science departments: Innsbruck, Salzburg and Vienna. Today two university political science departments have mainstreamed gender into their curriculum, with this being the result of the success of feminist entrepreneurs in these departments. The provision at the University of Vienna is typified by one where professors, associates and external lecturers contribute to the curriculum in gender political science. This state of affairs is, however, far from secure as the Bologna process, the transformation toward an entrepreneurial university as well as budget cuts challenge these institutionalizations. This article seeks to explain this mixed picture through an analysis of the recent state of the art of teaching and gender research in Austrian political science before proceeding to point out the favorable factors which fostered the establishment of gender studies in Political Science. Finally, the article builds on the recent challenging conditions which jeopardizes gender studies within the discipline. © 2016 European Consortium for Political Research.","2016","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","332-342","","","15","","","","","","","","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 3 Journal Abbreviation: Eur.

The EU wants Europe to become a more innovationfriendly continent and is currently working on a new strategy to create an ""Innovation Union"". This LERU paper presents the views of some of Europe's leading research-intensive universities (RIUs) as a contribution to the development of the EU strategy and the initiatives that will follow from it. Research-intensive universities, as the bedrock of internationally competitive, cutting edge research and an attraction pole for a vast and dynamic pool of talented researchers, have an important role to play in the Innovation Union. However, in recent decades their research efforts have been impoverished, with some notable exceptions, in comparison with other systems because of marginal-cost funding of research, the allocation of research funding on criteria other than excellence, and an obsession with bureaucratic even-handedness. The EU can help universities flourish by developing or promoting processes and infrastructures that stimulate and enable creativity. Efforts should be focused on five objectives: 1) stimulating excellence by investing heavily and wisely in competitive, frontier, undirected research; 2) attracting and nurturing the best talents for research of each generation; 3) creating a barrier-free space for European researchers to move around in; 4) ensuring the development of and access to major, state-of-the-art research infrastructures; 5) orchestrating collaboration in globally significant research programmes. When it comes to creating an environment that allows innovation to flourish, universities play an important enabling role in the innovation chain. RIUs in particular are hubs of creativity which attract research-intensive companies and investment into a region and help to catalyse innovation in local businesses. They have developed strong technology transfer offices (TTOs) that act as entrepreneurial hubs throughout the entire innovation network around RIUs. Within the university, TTOs are not just the centrepiece of the university's third mission operations. Because of the cognitive and financial spillovers that TTOs generate, their activities interweave across the first and second missions of research-intensive universities. If universities are to be more effective in enabling and catalysing innovation in Europe, action is required under three broad headings that reflect the interaction between supply and demand. We suggest that these should be the priorities for the university component in a European innovation union. These headings are 1) enhancing supply of relevant university capacity, 2) stimulating business demand and 3) improving university-business interactions. While universities in general and RIUs in particular play an important role in the innovation chain, they do not operate in isolation but are instead part of a larger innovation ecosystem. There are fundamentally four different, but interacting forces at work in driving innovation. These driving forces are: 1) competitively driven research, 2) dynamic entrepreneurship, 3) competitive, fair market environments and 4) adequate financial resources. We propose that the EU's efforts to create a better innovation-friendly environment should consist of a four-pronged attack aimed at stimulating these four driving forces and that they should focus on the combination and interaction of these forces. © 2010 Published by LERU.","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","101-116","","","13","","Procedia Soc.

To test the value of political activism, recent scholarship has probed the impact of corporate political activity (CPA) on firm performance. However, mixed findings and the fragmented nature of the field raise more questions than answers as to the nature of this relationship. This systematic review examines scholarly articles for evidence of the impact of CPA on firm value. The findings suggest that CPA is more valuable in emerging countries and that relational CPA strategies are more common in emerging (versus developed) countries where social capital underlies political and economic exchange. We also document the paucity of research on informational CPA strategies and policy outcomes in the emerging country context.

The scientific purpose of the study is to compile the views of scholars on technological entrepreneurship. Research Design & Methods: The first part of the study is of descriptive character and based on literature review, while the second part is empirical. The application of the empirical method of a case study has made it possible to characterize the essence of technological entrepreneurship and illustrate the development of the studied phenomenon in business practice. Findings: The concept of technological entrepreneurship is based on increasing innovation, new assets and competitiveness through more efficient use of research results leading to development of products and services. The process of creating technological entrepreneurship is conditioned largely by endogenous factors of organizations and also by the business ecosystem. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to further develop current theory of technological entrepreneurship through discussion on the methodological dilemmas associated with conducting research in this area. Contribution & Value Added: The article is an attempted synthesis of the concept of technological entrepreneurship as a process that combines the elements of academic and intellectual entrepreneurship with the entrepreneurship of commercial organizations implementing new technologies and innovative business solutions in the market environment. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

The current engineering curriculum has been designed to only to provide the theory, however, it doesn't provide the integration of how this knowledge can be applied. The courses that are taken as preparation for system engineering students include standard mechanical studies such as statics, dynamics, and structural analysis, but also, computer software and hardware courses that study C programming, circuit analysis and electronics. These types of collegiate engineering classes that are taken on a general level in all system engineering disciplines, are supposed to provide the theory that is needed to build a system; however, they do not teach the tools that are needed to know how to integrate these concepts together during the system development process. The downfall reflects in the student when they cannot develop a successful senior design project. As a solution, a state-of-the-art education is being presented as a project-based learning experience. This type of educational method has been designed to push motivated students into a fast pace, learn as you ""build"" environment in which students need to integrate educational theory with applications. While not being a requirement by the university, a directed independent study was performed by a junior level student in the summer of 2010. The objective of the study was to apply compartmentalized knowledge obtained from previous technical courses, such as circuits, logic design, and engineering mathematics, to design and build an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), given a set of requirements. At the end of this project, the student was evaluated in terms of his technical and educational accomplishments: the ASV was successfully built that met the given requirements, and the student has demonstrated a deeper understanding of how to apply and integrate educational knowledge to solve a real-life problem. The outcome of this project is a needed experience for any engineering scholar. It provides a stepping stone from the collegiate environment to professional development, while linking the integration of educational knowledge with practical design tactics. We envision that this type of project can be implemented effectively as a regular course so students can learn hands-on experience in system engineering design that cannot be found in a text book. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ASEE Annu.

The purpose of this paper is to conduct an empirical study to inquire about the variable growth barriers to Chinese USOs, in order to address two major research questions of this paper: what are the major growth barriers, and how significant they are; and what supports should university and government provide to eliminate those barriers? Design/methodology/approach: In the first place, this paper attempts to explore the research questions through literature review and pilot interviews, based on which, a questionnaire for a survey was developed. Then, this study then attempts to address the research questions through a nation-wide survey in 2009 across 69 national university science parks. Findings: This paper finds that corporate governance issues, managerial concerns, and lack of infrastructure support are three major categories of barriers that thwart the growth of USOs in China. In addition, this paper also identified the support that is expected from universities and government agencies in order to cope with the barriers. Originality/value: This paper contributes to theory in three ways. First, it tests and validates some existing conceptual frameworks concerned with the growth barriers to USOs. Second, it sheds light on the specific growth concerns of Chinese USOs and identifies three kinds of barriers. Further, this study provides evidence for future policy making regarding USOs and university technology transfer activities in China. This research will be of interest to policy makers, academic entrepreneurs, and university administrators. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2011","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","277-294","","3","2","","J.

Yet, a growing body of literature emphasizes the importance of preserving some of their original grassroots culture. Based on a qualitative meta-analysis of 19 in-depth cases from the past decade, our integrative model contributes to this debate in three important ways: first, we suggest that most NPO pathways of development are characterized by the acquisition of a dual nature i.e., a community setting a value-based mission (stage 1) and a professional structure involving formal and centralized coordination aimed at effectiveness (stage 2); second, that this dual system often leads NPOs to an existential crisis characterized by contradiction and indetermination (stage 3); and third, that this indetermination constitutes a window of opportunity for deciders to more deliberately arbitrate the orientation adopted by their NPOs (stage 4). We discuss the role of deciders, beyond institutional pressures, to explain why the nonprofit sector is still relatively diverse. We propose voluntarism and institutional entrepreneurship as important mainstays of nonprofitness. © 2014, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","2015","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-26 14:37:18","","1894-1919","","5","26","","Voluntas","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer New York LLC","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/bKdWV?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=wVrls1%2B5FULHkLtRKjL8%2FmQL6ws%3D","Management science; Stages; entrepreneur; Europe; Community; community development; Development; grassroots level; institutional framework; modeling; nonprofit organization; Pathways; Professionalization; voluntary approach; Strategic planning; Studies; Case studies; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 9175:Western Europe; 2310:Planning; 2600:Management science/operations research; 9540:Non-profit institutions; International; Nonprofit organization; Nonprofit organizations; Organization; Social Services And Welfare; Voluntarism; Voluntary sector","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A conceptual framework was developed examining three areas: stakeholder management, tourism development and service learning projects and knowledge transfer. Sixteen (16) stakeholders took part in the case study using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. A thematic analysis was conducted informed by the literature review. The first research theme related to stakeholders’ objectives, roles and perceptions about the involvement of other stakeholders. The second theme includes all the strategic management issues concerning the tourism development project. This includes issues of transferring knowledge from students and teachers to the community, a feature of service learning projects of this type. Thirdly, the relationships amongst stakeholders are outlined in a Venn diagram. Finally, the hindrances encountered in the projects connected to the other themes are discussed in this paper. The paper concludes that even though the project is found to be beneficial to all stakeholders, including students and teachers, enhancing the academic experience, it is fraught with challenges and several hindrances. One of the challenges is to plan activities in a way that takes into consideration the needs of the community involved in the tourism project, which are not aligned with the university scheduling. Problems of coordination and communication arise from a lack of strong leadership in the management of these projects. This includes a clear understanding of the various roles and responsibilities together with an analysis of the power and legitimacy of each stakeholder. © 2017","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","87-100","","","20","","J.

The research that explored the relationship between corruption and entrepreneurship has produced controversial results. It appears that the interaction of these two constructs is influenced by contextual factors both at an individual and national level of analysis. By using a bibliometric methodology and a fractional counting method to analyse the scientific literature on corruption and entrepreneurship, this paper identifies and analyses 180 articles recorded in the Scopus database. It represents a contribution by showing the state of the art of research on corruption and entrepreneurship and proposes future lines of research. Important results have been found about the evolution of the volume of articles and citations on this topic over time. Significant academic interest in this field commenced in the 21st century, and more specifically in the last ten years. This work also provides findings about the most prolific journals, institutions and authors, as well as the most relevant countries, with the United States and United Kingdom leading in terms of the number of publications. In addition, an in-depth analysis of authors' keywords has identified different trends, such as institutions, economic growth, shadow economy, regulation, Africa, culture, economic development, business environment, and informal economy. Finally, some future research lines are proposed, such as institutional theory, tax morale, corruption perceptions, European regions, risk aversion and institutional entrepreneurship. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","1-11","","4","22","","J.

The purpose of this paper is to cover this gap and explore how knowledge is transferred and flows among all the healthcare ecosystems’ players in order to support open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual in nature and adopts a narrative literature review approach. In particular, insights gathered from open innovation literature at the inter-organizational network level, with a particular attention to healthcare ecosystems, and from the knowledge transfer processes, are analyzed in order to propose an interpretative framework for the understanding of knowledge transfer in open innovation with a focus on healthcare ecosystem. Findings: The paper proposes an original interpretative framework for knowledge transfer to support open innovation in healthcare ecosystems, composed of four main components: healthcare ecosystem’s players’ categories; knowledge flows among different categories of players along the exploration and exploitation stages of innovation development; players’ motivations for open innovation; and players’ positions in the innovation process. In addition, assuming the intermediary network as the suitable organizational model for healthcare ecosystem, four classification scenarios are identified on the basis of the main players’ influence degree and motivations for open innovation. Practical implications: The paper offers interpretative lenses for managers and policy makers in understanding the most suitable organizational models able to encourage open innovation in healthcare ecosystems, taking into consideration the players’ motivation and the knowledge transfer processes on the basis of the innovation results. Originality/value: The paper introduces a novel framework that fills a gap in the innovation management literature, by pointing out the key role of external not R&D players, like patients, involved in knowledge transfer for open innovation processes in healthcare ecosystems. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","144-163","","1","25","","Bus.

Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a literature review, a theoretical model that is focused on the theory of planned behaviour was defined to verify the impact of higher education on the development of EI and HC. To this end, the structural equation modelling methodology was applied to two samples of students and academics, which differ each other in terms of both education level and specific characteristics of entrepreneurship education activities. Findings: The main results show that there are significant differences between the two considered samples. In particular, the level and specific characteristics of entrepreneurial education are the key factors for the development of EI and HC. Practical implications: The research may be of relevance for universities and policy makers. Universities must devote more attention to training and practice-oriented entrepreneurial courses and collateral activities (projects, initiatives, actions), both for students (first mission) and academic aspiring entrepreneurs (third mission) to encourage the emergence of EI and HC formation. For policy makers, this study suggests the need to define policy guidelines and frameworks to support universities’ educational programmes and activities to strengthen the entrepreneurial process, so that they can be consistent with the EU and national entrepreneurship policies. Originality/value: This explorative research intends to contribute to the scientific debate by filling the knowledge gap that is due to the very limited number of studies that analyse whether and how EI can mediate the relationship between higher education and HC as an IC component. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","135-156","","1","19","","J.

In this paper, we trace the outflows of HRH from the Philippines, map out its key causes and consequences, and identify relevant policy responses. Methods: This mixed method study employed a decentered, comparative approach that involved three phases: (a) a scoping review on health workers' migration of relevant policy documents and academic literature on health workers' migration from the Philippines; and primary data collection with (b) 37 key stakeholders and (c) household surveys with seven doctors, 329 nurses, 66 midwives, and 18 physical therapists. Results: Filipino health worker migration is best understood within the context of macro-, meso-, and micro-level factors that are situated within the political, economic, and historical/colonial legacy of the country. Underfunding of the health system and un- or underemployment were push factors for migration, as were concerns for security in the Philippines, the ability to practice to full scope or to have opportunities for career advancement. The migration of health workers has both negative and positive consequences for the Philippine health system and its health workers. Stakeholders focused on issues such as on brain drain, gain, and circulation, and on opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer. Concomitantly, migration has resulted in the loss of investment in human capital. The gap in the supply of health workers has affected the quality of care delivered, especially in rural areas. The opening of overseas opportunities has commercialized health education, compromised its quality, and stripped the country of skilled learning facilitators. The social cost of migration has affected émigrés and their families. At the household level, migration has engendered increased consumerism and materialism and fostered dependency on overseas remittances. Addressing these gaps requires time and resources. At the same time, migration is, however, seen by some as an opportunity for professional growth and enhancement, and as a window for drafting more effective national and inter-country policy responses to HRH mobility. Conclusions: Unless socioeconomic conditions are improved and health professionals are provided with better incentives, staying in the Philippines will not be a viable option. The massive expansion in education and training designed specifically for outmigration creates a domestic supply of health workers who cannot be absorbed by a system that is underfunded. This results in a paradox of underservice, especially in rural and remote areas, at the same time as underemployment and outmigration. Policy responses to this paradox have not yet been appropriately aligned to capture the multilayered and complex nature of these intersecting phenomena. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","","","1","15","","Hum.

Accordingly, they have put in place policies, methods and resources to increase knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) activities. However, succeeding in this endeavour is not that easy. An active involvement of researchers is fundamental. Literature examining researchers’ attitude towards KTT activities is limited, offering a partial view on the subject. This study aims at bringing new light to this issue. First, we identify those factors that influence researchers’ willingness to engage in KTT activities. From a comprehensive literature review, we distinguish between intrinsic motivations, extrinsic motivations and university support and services as critical elements. A scale is developed and validated. Second, the scale is applied to the case of R&D contracts. The sample consists of 249 researchers from one of the biggest Spanish universities. Results suggest that the proposed scale has a good fit, indicating that it can be considered as a good instrument for measuring researchers’ willingness to get involved in KTT activities.

Current and future trends in the field are identified. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers an SLR on the entrepreneurship education and training and advances through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis comprising the period 1973-2016. To collect data, only articles published in scientific journals were used in the SCOPUS database. Findings: The results highlight that both training and entrepreneurship education can be a strong strategic tool for regional development, and that it is important for entities such as academia, government and business to cooperate towards the same goal in order to strengthen the entrepreneurial intention of society. Findings reveal three clusters as trends of literature: entrepreneurial universities, entrepreneurial spirit and process of business creation.

The review focuses on four central measures related to university-industry (U-I) collaboration for KT that have been previously identified in the literature: motivations; activities; barriers; and outcomes. Different rationales underpin existing studies and we frame these using two perspectives: the sociopolitical perspective and the contextual perspective. To date studies with a sociopolitical perspective have largely focused upon 'motivations' to engage in U-I collaboration but largely from academics' perspectives and tangible activities and outcomes have been the foci of the contextual perspective on KT but these have rarely been sector specific. We discuss these and other major findings in terms of policy implications for future research funding. © The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

Using the ENTRE-U scale, the researchers have graded the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of the employees at state universities in the Republic of Serbia. In the theoretical part, the detailed literature review is provided, which contributes to a better understanding of terms like entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial university. Using data from 282 respondents who work at the state universities in the Republic of Serbia, the researchers validate the ENTRE-U questionnaire in a specific context. With this, it is proven that the ENTRE-U scale is applicable not only for developed countries but also for the developing countries, such as the Republic of Serbia. The general conclusion is that with using the ENTRE-U scale, it is possible to predict the level of innovativeness, as well as the nature of innovative activities that are conducted at state universities in the Republic of Serbia. The entrepreneurially oriented universities differ from those which lack entrepreneurial orientation by the extent of their research mobilization, unconventional approaches, the level of cooperation with industries, and the way university policies are implemented. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","","","6","11","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","","","","innovation; literature review; empirical analysis; research work; Entrepreneurial university; entrepreneur; ENTRE-U scale; Entrepreneurial orientation; questionnaire survey; Republic of Serbia; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; Serbia; Triple helix","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the aeronautical supply chain, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) lack of these types of alliances with universities and other research institutions, which could give them access to shared and specialized knowledge, may strictly limit those companies to learning from their own experience. One way to break this dynamic for industrial companies is to be an active part of research, development, and innovation centres. In this paper, a study to create new advanced manufacturing centres is presented, centres whose activities are focused on Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 5-7. The approach is based on a project management methodology, and it is applied to the aeronautical sector in the Basque Country. An initial study of the international experience and state of the art in this type of facility, as well as an analysis of the current socioeconomic environment of the Basque Country are presented. A benchmark study was done to identify the key processes that this centre must promote for this initiative to succeed, or those areas of knowledge that can make or break the initiative. Finally, the results showed a definitive picture for establishing an advanced manufacturing centre in the Basque Country. This work lays both the foundations of knowledge in the sector and the difficulties noted, so it can serve as guidance for similar initiatives. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","","","18","11","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","","","","Technology transfer; technology transfer; Project management; Advanced manufacturing research centre; Industrial park; manufacturing; Manufacturing industry; Manufacturing readiness level; model; project management; small and medium-sized enterprise; strategic approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, case studies of how diverse stakeholders form self-organized coalitions under these circumstances exist and provide invaluable opportunities to understand the causal mechanisms that operate in the process. We focus on the case of the Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve nomination process, which unfolded over several years and moved the region from a series of serious conflicts to one where stakeholders came together to support a Biosphere Reserve nomination. Causal mechanisms identified from the literature and considered most relevant to the case were confirmed in it, using an 'explaining outcomes' process tracing methodology. Perceived severity of the problem, institutional emulation, and institutional entrepreneurship all played an important role in the coalition-building process. The fear of marginalization was identified as a potential causal mechanism that requires further study.

With the aim of filling this gap, this paper proposes a novel contribution regarding the emerging concept of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship. Based on a qualitative literature review, an interpretative framework for Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is deductively proposed that is composed of the following components: the rationale for the adoption of digital technologies for academic entrepreneurship (why), the emerging forms of digital academic entrepreneurship (what), the stakeholders involved through the digital technologies to achieve the academic entrepreneurship goal (who), and the processes of academic entrepreneurship supported by digital technologies (how).

Meanwhile, the very recent notion of “blue growth” and the significant development potential related to marine environments have gained more and more concern for policy makers on different scales. It is therefore interesting to assess the academic research related to marine issues, owing to its potential contribution to this dynamics growth through knowledge transfers and academic spillovers. This paper provides a global evaluation of the marine academic production, using a spatialized, open and transdisciplinary approach. In particular, this approach is to mobilize indicators to assess scientific production, transpose it to the territorial scale and make a global comparison of “research territories” in the case of marine science, with a specific focus on European cities. The results show that the five main centres are Tokyo (Japan), Paris (France), San Diego (USA), Moscow (Russia) and Woods Hole (USA). A dense European territorial coverage in marine science centres also appears, and new world major centres such as Chinese and Brazilian ones emerge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","119-129","","","84","","Mar.

The second influencing factor is generated by the restrictions imposed by the related legislation. Besides this two, the poor stage of the consumer’s insulation and of the heat distribution network, or the lack of the main know-how energy management concepts seriously affects the good functioning of a producer-consumer energy mix. The university together with the university Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHP) represent a supplier and consumer system. In this paper, are presented a few major energy management decisions that has been taken and applied to the university CHP and campus. This package of energy management solutions has been taken to increase the performances of university CHP and to bring them in accordance with the state of the art. At the present, in order to optimize the operating regimes of the cogeneration plant, authors have studied the correlation between functioning load of the plant and the possible solutions that could be applied to increase the plant performances. Those solutions have to be strongly correlated with the consumers’ heat demand. In this regard one proposed measure is to sell the heat into the district heating network of the city. Another proposed solution for which there has been performed a technical-economic analysis, is the implementation of a new equipment that can generate centralized cold in order to supply a part of the University Campus buildings. The new cooling system will use as primer energy source the heat recovered from the CHP plant. In this special case study, two main important problems occurs, both being related to the type of the consumer: public institution where the demand for cooling suffers huge variations and where occupants have little incentive to follow the rules of good energy management. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The open nature of the Internet drives its success, and e-businesses allow their partners, suppliers or consumers an extraordinary degree of access to databases and their inner work. In its turn, this revolution in communications has shifted the focus on selecting adequate workforce skills and knowledge. This is where academic education finds its niche, by using e-activities widely for all e-learners ready to step up own careers and capitalise on entrepreneur ideas, and wishing to become proficient e-managers.

Several best practices and models have been proposed to address the problem of establishing U-I collaborations and improving their effectiveness. It is important for the stakeholders to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of their collaborative efforts in order to identify and adopt improvements. One way to assess effectiveness is through the maturity models approach that has been applied successfully in other areas such as quality assurance, knowledge management, and business processes. Our literature review indicates a lack of existing collaboration maturity models. In this paper, we present the University-industry Collaboration Maturity Model (UICMM) - a collaboration maturity model based on the thorough review of best practices for collaboration described in existing literature, and existing maturity models relevant to collaborations. UICMM is intended to be a useful benchmarking tool for a range of stakeholders including universities and industry to assess and benchmark their collaborative efforts. The underlying hypothesis while developing this maturity model is that a higher level of maturity will lead to increased collaboration and improved outcomes. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

At the same time, the U–I literature experienced a notable increase in the past decade, transforming into a multi-faceted and ambiguous research field, characterised by highly complex interlinks. The recent transformation hinders a comprehensive understanding of the latest developments in research directions and their clear delineation. Therefore, the purpose of this bibliometric literature review is to examine the evolution of the field and identify the primary emerging patterns. This paper employs co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling techniques to analyse the U–I publications dataset. The findings indicate that the U–I collaborations research can be systematically clustered, resulting in an interconnected ecosystem consisting of three levels: individual, organisational and institutional, respectively. Thus, this review presents the immense contribution that the analysis of U–I collaborations makes to various research streams.

Efforts to transform our societies must thus prioritise the education of educators – building their understanding of sustainability and their ability to transform curriculum and wider learning opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to focus on university educators and critically review the professional development and policy landscape challenges that influence their effective engagement with Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The paper is informed by a pan-European collaboration involving 33 countries that identified emerging scholarship and practice in this area and assessed the lessons learned from ESD professional development initiatives. It sets the context for a special issue titled “Professional Development in Higher Education for Sustainable Development” that draws together a collection of articles focusing on professional development of university educators across the world. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a critical review of existing practice, international policy frameworks and literature relating to ESD, professional development and higher education. It examines innovative initiatives worldwide that seek to improve the capability of educators in higher education to integrate ESD into academic practice at individual, disciplinary and institutional levels. A rigorous process of selection was applied and overseen by an international expert group. This ensured that the initiatives sought educational change in ESD, and not simply the embedding of content about sustainability into learning opportunities. It also assured that the initiatives had a clear and intentional professional learning process to underpin the engagement of participants with ESD. Findings: ESD has grown in visibility and status worldwide, with a clear increase in activity in higher education. The sector is viewed as a significant force for change in societies, through the education provision it offers to future professionals and leaders in all sectors. However, universities currently lack capacity to integrate ESD effectively into mainstream teaching practices and the training they provide for academic staff or to integrate ESD into their institutional teaching and learning priorities. Many ESD activities remain focused on teaching issues arising in sustainable development research and delivering specialist modules or courses in sustainability. Very few countries and institutions have significant staff development programmes to enhance the ESD competences of university educators and build their academic leadership capabilities for ESD. The contributions to this special issue show the need for greater understanding of the multi-level task of integrating ESD into professional development activities, not just for individual impact in the classroom but to advance institutional change and decisively influence the teaching and learning discourse of higher education. Originality/value: There are few research studies and documented activities on ESD professional development in higher education available in the literature. This paper attempts to explore what ESD professional development involves and describes its complexity within the higher education sector. The special issue provides a collection of innovative research and practical initiatives that can help those involved in education and learning to develop ESD as a priority for future university innovative pathways. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-25 13:43:15","","798-820","","5","18","","Int.

Design/methodology: A literature review based on the theories of relational capital and networking from an international perspective. A theoretic model is then developed. Findings: The analyses in this paper show that relational capital influences the internationalization of university spin-offs in a positive manner. In addition, the firm's performance in its international activities depends on its capabilities to create and maintain relationships with the relational capital agents. Research limitations/implications: This is a theoretical paper; because of this, it would be advisable to complete it using a hybrid methodology, i.e., qualitative and quantitative analyses. Moreover, it would be useful to consider other sectors besides the technology sector. Practical implications: Following the literature review, which is limited to studies that jointly address these issues, a strategic analysis tool is developed that aims to improve the management of the relational capital to create value. This is carried out as part of the decision-making process related to the effect and links among the elements of the aforementioned capital, taking into account an international perspective. Social implications: In the current globalized economy, intangible management is more important than it used to be, in order to obtain competitive advantages in the business world. Furthermore, internationalization becomes an escape route in the face of a difficult economic situation, in which small companies must overcome significant problems in the local market. Originality/value: Nowadays, business internationalization is very important, and in this context, relational capital management plays a critical role in achieving competitive advantages. In spite of this, the literature review is restricted to studies that jointly address both issues (relational capital and internationalization). This makes for an interesting challenge, which is what this paper attempts to examine, through application in one of the most influential sectors in economic development. © 2019 OmniaScience.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:15","2025-07-26 14:53:50","","22-37","","1","15","","Intang.

The main driver behind this initiative has been engineering department's strategy to deliver education aligned to the global state-of-the-art practices, focused on user-centered design, technology-driven entrepreneurship, problem-based learning and a focus on rigor in the engineering fundamentals. This complemented the university's initiative to embed entrepreneurship across all its programmes. Traditionally the entrepreneurship education originated in business or management schools. In the last decades many educational institutions have introduced entrepreneurial education in the engineering curriculum. There are three main models used by the first academic institutions in the United States for entrepreneurial education. A decade later, another study undertaken on more than two hundred universities in five countries suggested five models of entrepreneurship education for engineering students. The paper is focused on the new and more complex model that has been developed, consisting in an entrepreneurship initiative pursued independently by engineering and the business school, supported by the university's innovation and business support team, and by external partnerships with entrepreneurship centres based in schools of engineering. Moreover all university's students are exposed additional extra-curricular entrepreneurship training. The Engineering & Entrepreneurship undergraduate programme was launched in September 2018. The paper discusses the process of designing the engineering & entrepreneurship programme's innovative structure, content, and assessment, within the frame of the evolution of similar programmes. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

Botswana‘s STEM University seeks to develop a technology park in which it will commercialize the research and intellectual property developed by its faculty members, students, research centers and the country‘s private sector through incubation and other processes. As a business support process, technology business incubation nurtures start-up companies and mitigates the risk of their early failure. In this enabling environment, start-ups can concentrate on technology transfer and later ―hatch‖ or leave the incubator financially viable and self-sustaining. Pursuing academic entrepreneurship and the university-model of technology business incubation present benefits for the country, the local community and the university in terms of economic development, economic diversification, job creation, technology development, viable firms, successful products, and the enhancement of university income and prestige. However, university and faculty culture, and the extent of faculty members‘ knowledge and skills in entrepreneurship and social capital may temper this potential. Utilizing a narrative review of the literature, this paper sought to identify critical issues a newly-participating university should be aware of as it seeks to adopt the university-model of business incubation to facilitate its transformation from a primary focus on its traditional research and teaching missions to one also based on the formal commercialization activities characterizing academic entrepreneurship. The paper informs on approaches the university may adopt to encourage academic entrepreneurship among its faculty members. © 2020, Sciedu Press.

In order to cope with these new challenges, they have started to operate in a strategic manner, by performing marketing and merchandising activities. Indeed, in a sector characterized by the presence of competitive funding models, several forms of accountability, and performance indicators, universities have become open systems and have started to operate like enterprises, considering students as customers. Given this premise, the aim of the paper is to individuate marketing and merchandising strategies in higher education and to evaluate their effectiveness in order to foster stakeholders engagement. This is in line with the entrepreneurial university model that represents the starting point of the theoretical study, then a literature review of “marketization” in higher education institutions is presented, showing how this field is not yet completely investigated. Data refer to the Italian context and are analyzed through a qualitative method.

The ability to develop new solutions and services is considered essential to firm survival and growth. The innovation process, being long and costly, relies heavily on interorganizational relations and the interaction between different types of actors (e.g., intermediary support organizations, universities, R&D centers) that can advance knowledge transfer and innovation. Consequently, innovation is seen as an open and interactive process. Many researches related to economic geography have demonstrated that the different types of proximity can be an important tool to facilitate interactions and knowledge exchange. The Information and communication technology (ICT) sector is recognized as a key driving force for Lebanon’s economy. It is a fast growing sector with an estimated market size of USD 436.2 million in 2016. Furthermore, Lebanon is emerging as a leading exporter of software development and services in the region. The methodology of this paper is mainly based on a literature review and interviews based on semi-structured interviews, which were conducted face to face, or by phone. The first objective of this paper is to analyze the characteristics and dynamics of innovation within the Lebanese software industry. The second objective is to provide a framework to analyze how the different types of proximity affect the innovation and the interactions inter-actors within this industry. The paper demonstrates that innovation in the Lebanese software sector is often driven by the demand and the client’s needs and request. In addition, we noticed that in Lebanon, the local R&D structures or the universities do not support this sector. Furthermore, the support offered by the Lebanese government is still weak and this is manly related to the complexity of the political and social system in Lebanon. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

A literature review investigates the connections between the use of Big Data, AI and Analytics and the ethical considerations. The use of a stated data protection code of conduct backed up by legal constraints is developing but in its infancy. Academic researchers and business practioners of knowledge management should be interested in developing an ethical approach to this new set of technologies that puts access to knowledge on the desk of every knowledge worker while protecting the individual from unethical and illegal misuse of their data. This paper presents a set of principles for governing this new frontier of ethics and legality from the literature.

Case methods allow for more in-depth analyses and provide the opportunity to place research into a certain context due to the selection of e.g. specific sectors, institutions, countries, etc. Using a systematic literature review of five of the top journals in the field of technology transfer research, namely Journal of Technology Transfer, Research Policy, Science and Public Policy, R&D Management and Technovation, it yielded 107 articles using the search terms: “Technology Transfer” AND (“Case Study” OR “Case Method” OR “Qualitative”). Our findings indicate a clustering of themes using qualitative case methods around technology transfer mechanisms and TTOs, academic entrepreneurship, university-industry collaboration, commercialization as well as R&D and firm knowledge transfer. We also identify trends in case method technology transfer research with respect to authorship, location of papers, sectoral contexts, data collection, numbers of cases and data analysis software. We conclude our paper discussing the implications of trends and themes and suggest that researchers need to reflect on used terminology and their utilization and postulate a need for more plurality of data collection methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-26 14:42:34","","923-956","","4","42","","J.

Recent reviews of the literature show that university technology transfer is primarily conceptualized in terms a relatively linear process of disclosure, patenting, and licensing. While this is the general pattern for university patenting, many faculty inventions are also patented outside the university. Using data from a national survey of academic patenters, this paper estimates probit and negative binomial regression models to assess individual and organizational factors that contribute to patenting external to the traditional technology transfer process among university scientists. Findings indicate that external patenting is a function of the science, scientist's training, and the lack of a department culture of encouraging patenting via technology transfer offices. © The Author 2016.

This paper presents a snapshot of the barriers to effective LCA-based land-use planning in Israel, with regard to four distinct phases of the process: (a) the knowledge development phase, i.e., the formulation of a credible LCA approach; (b) the approach adoption phase, i.e., the willingness to incorporate LCA processes and outputs into land-use planning; (c) the knowledge transfer phase, i.e., the actual incorporation of LCA outputs into land-use planning; and (d) the application management phase, i.e., the transition of LCA- based plans into action. To investigate the barriers, the study combines a literature review with thematic analysis of eight Israeli LCA-based land-use plans from all planning levels, and individual in-depth interviews with 35 senior planners and decision makers involved in the design and implementation of these plans. The study reveals that within the general trajectory of mainstreaming LCA approach in Israel over the past two and a half decades, significant gaps exist between LCA knowledge, LCA-based land-use planning, and on- ground action and results. The extent of the gaps differs across plans and planning scales. The gaps are rooted in the complexity of the LCA approach; language barriers; scientific and technical limitations; inconsistency and subjectivity; different academic, planning, and decision-making traditions; limited institutional capacity; vagueness and over-flexibility of approved LCA-based planning principles and instructions; and lack of sufficient involvement by stakeholders. This paper offers suggestions as to how these gaps might be bridged in the Israeli context. In conclusion, the study recommends the following: developing a legally binding, generic, credible, and continuously updated LCA-based planning guide, that should be written in the native language; establishing a national and comprehensive free-access online information center for sharing LCA knowledge; strengthening of institutional capacities at all planning levels; enhancing planners' and consultants' LCA skills; and inclusion of all affected stakeholders in the process. Broadening the understanding of the obstacles and solutions to effective application of LCA processes and outputs in land-use planning and management practices can contribute to operationalizing this approach in various contexts and eventually, advance the reduction of anthropogenic pressures on valuable landscapes. © 2016","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","220-230","","","61","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Land-use planning; Landscape Character Assessment; Landscape characterizations; Landscape classification; Landscape typology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: This paper reports on the current state of technology transfer in software engineering. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review, in which we investigated 3070 papers. We identified in total 70 relevant papers, which were subject of a detailed analysis. Results: Many different approaches are proposed to foster technology transfer in software engineering. The majority of these approaches suggest direct collaboration between industry and academia or teaching new technologies in industrial training or university education. In addition, a considerable number of experience reports on technology transfer exist. Hence, a multitude of best practices, success stories, and lessons learned is reported. Among others, empirical evidence, maturity, and adaptability of the technology seem important preconditions for successful transfer, while social and organizational factors seem important barriers to successful technology transfer. Conclusion: Our findings can aid software engineering researchers in determining how best to support the transfer of their research results into practice. Furthermore, analysis of the literature also revealed that no reports exist on the combination of various technology transfer approaches, which could increase advantages of existing approaches while reducing their disadvantages. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","","","11","30","","J.

This article aims to summarize the concept of transfer offices and the context of the generation of knowledge through patents in Latin America, and identify strategies that have been suggested in the literature to set up and operate this type of offices, based on the Latin American context. Design/methodology: Through a systemic literature review, academic articles indexed in the ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases were analyzed to identify the literature related to the context of technology transfer and transfer offices. We cited and analyzed in depth a total of 40 articles. For a review of the Latin American context, 29 documents were reviewed and referenced. Previous documents were taken from specialized networks of the Scientific Information System REDALYC and libraries of universities, such as the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, among others. Additionally, we added reports and publications by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), and REDEMPRENDIA. Statistical data provided by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) were used for the analysis of patent generation cases in Latin American countries. Subsequently, the literature of the systematic review was compared with studies by authors and Latin American entities, which give a regional context to this work. Finally, strategies were discussed and identified for the consolidation of transfer offices that impact the generation of knowledge in the region. Findings: The results of the literature review conducted revealed that several authors have proposed extensive mechanisms for transfer offices in Latin America that reject the general practices based on patent generation, due to the low generation of patents in the region. These mechanisms permit the generation and transfer of knowledge through different means. Therefore, the results of this article allow for a definition of strategies that has been adjusted to the reality and needs of Latin America, in order to consolidate the transfer offices. Originality/value: The contribution made by this article is focused on identifying possible strategies for consolidating transfer offices that contribute to the technological development of Latin American countries, taking into account the cultural context and limitations of the institutions of higher education. © 2018, OmniaScience.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","203-252","","2","14","","Intang.

HBCUs lag behind their peer non-HBCUs because historically they have been under-served and were originally established largely as teaching and blue collar trade schools. Increased involvement in research oriented activities such as technology transfer will likely enable HBCUs to grow into new or stronger research institutions. The literature review revealed several problem areas with non-HBCUs university technology transfer include a resource planning issues. These problem areas for non-HBCUs would be challenging for HBCUs as well. Problems with university technology transfer have led to unethical behavior among faculty inventors and university technology transfer specialists at non-HBCUs (C. Hamilton, Schumann, D., 2016). Despite these problems, the non-HBCUs are generating licensing revenues. Systems dynamics is the process of combining the theory, method and philosophy necessary to analyze the behavior of a system in order to provide a common foundation that can be applied whenever it is desired to understand and influence how things change over time. Applying the systems dynamics approach, a budget resource planning tool was developed using a linear programming optimization technique. This study illustrates that classic industrial uses of linear programming optimization techniques can uniquely be used to optimize budget resource planning for sustainable HBCU supply chain networks and other emerging research institutions. © 2017 American Society for Engineering Management.","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Society for Engineering Management","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

These methods are gaining popularity in dentistry, but quality and breadth of use have not been evaluated. Objectives: To describe multiattribute stated preference experiment use in dentistry through illustration and critique of existing studies. Data Sources: Systematic literature search of PubMed, Econlit and Ovid for Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, and All EBM Reviews, as well as gray literature. Study Eligibility: Multiattribute stated preference experiments eliciting preferences for dental service delivery, treatments, and oral health states from the perspective of patients, the public, and dental professionals. Outcomes of interest were preference weights and marginal rates of substitution. Study selection was independently performed by 2 reviewers. Appraisal: Ten-point checklist published by the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research was used for quality assessment. Synthesis: Descriptive analysis. Results: Searches identified 12 records published between 1999 and 2015, mostly in nondental academic journals. Studies were undertaken in high-income countries in Europe and the United States. The studies aimed to elicit preference for service delivery, treatment, or oral health states from the perspective of the patients, dentists, or the public via discrete choice experiment methods. The quality scores for the studies ranged from 53% to 100%. Limitations: A detailed description and critique of stated preference methods are provided, but it was not possible to provide synthesized preference data. Conclusions: Multiattribute stated preference experiments are increasingly popular, but understanding the methods and outputs is essential for designing and interpreting preference studies to improve patient care. Patient preferences highlight important considerations for decision making during treatment planning. Valuation of health states and estimation of willingness-to-pay are important for resource planning and allocation and economic evaluation. Preference estimates and relative value of attributes for interventions and service delivery inform development and selection of treatments and services (PROSPERO 21.3.17: CRD42017059859). Knowledge Transfer Statement: Understanding patient, professional, and public preferences is fundamental for evidence-based decision making and treatment delivery. Preference elicitation methods can be used to estimate the value given to health states, service delivery, individual treatments, and health outcomes. By describing and appraising the methodology and application of multiattribute stated preference experiments in dentistry, this review provides an essential first step to wider use of well-designed, high-quality preference elicitation methods. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2018.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","326-335","","4","3","","JDR Clin.

Since today’s entrepreneurship deals with heterogeneous groups, the norms and values that govern interactions and relationships among people and institutions must be given due emphasis. In recent years there is growing empirical evidence that social capital contributes significantly to development and sustainability. However, literature on the role of social capital in enhancing the performance of the entrepreneurial university in Malaysia is scarce and perhaps almost absent. The main objective of this study is to identify the impacts of social capital towards the performance of an entrepreneurial university. Specifically, this study focuses on exploring the potentials of social capital in enhancing the performance of the entrepreneurial university in Malaysia through four main elements namely: trust, networking, shared values and shared vision. A literature review was conducted to identify and develop appropriate research instruments to be utilized in this study. Quantitative method approach was used in this research. Selected respondents was taken among the six public university which is University Technology Mara (UiTM),UniversityTeknikal Malaysia Melaka(UTeM), University Utara Malaysia(UUM), University Putra Malaysia(UPM), UniversitiTeknologi Malaysia(UTM) and University Malaysia Perlis(UNIMAP) as they are among the five finalists of MOHE Entrepreneurial Awards (MEA) in 2012. Subsequently, this study employed a descriptive and inferential analysis to test the conceptual framework in order to understand the impacts of social capital on the performance of an entrepreneurial university. This study providesrecommendations for university management to review specific policies initiatives and strategies related to social capital towards enhancing the performance of entrepreneurial universities in Malaysia. © 2019 SERSC.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","440-450","","1","28","","Int.

Research universities can now own and license these inventions to small and well established companies. Since 1980, research universities have used tech commercialization to support their regional economies with product development and sales, and academic entrepreneurship resulting in university spinoffs and start-up business formations. This results in job creation. The technology transfer offices (TTOs) which were established at many research universities to manage this process have been studied quite extensively. However, the foundational elements that fuel successful TTO performance has not been studied comprehensively. Instead, there are numerous fragmented studies that date back to the early 1980s. In addition, there is no agreed upon common theory for studying university technology and how these elemental inputs related to performance outputs. Thus, herein it is advocated that the resource-based view (J. Barney, 1991) and theory on environmental munificence (Castrogiovanni, 1991, 2002) be used as a theoretical framework for researching university technology commercialization. Competitive resources in a more munificent environment can make it easier for an organization to survive and prosper. © Copyright© (2018) by American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM).

Processing photons by photons unfolds new scenarios, in principle allowing for unseen signal processing and computing capabilities. Optical computation can be seen as a large scientific field in which researchers operate, trying to find solutions to their specific needs by different approaches; although the challenges can be substantially different, they are typically addressed using knowledge and technological platforms that are shared across the whole field. This significant know-how can also benefit other scientific communities, providing lateral solutions to their problems, as well as leading to novel applications. The aim of this Roadmap is to provide a broad view of the state-of-the-art in this lively scientific research field and to discuss the advances required to tackle emerging challenges, thanks to contributions authored by experts affiliated to both academic institutions and high-tech industries. The Roadmap is organized so as to put side by side contributions on different aspects of optical processing, aiming to enhance the cross-contamination of ideas between scientists working in three different fields of photonics: optical gates and logical units, high bit-rate signal processing and optical quantum computing.

The burgeoning literature examining key antecedents and consequences of academic entrepreneurship resulted in complex, multifaceted concept development, which hinder both the possibilities to grasp the crucial interlinkages and a comprehensive assessment of the latest theoretical contributions. Thus, to decrease the current risk of the field’s further fragmentation and to support the comparison with the new emerging patterns, this paper seeks to develop new bibliometric insights and outline a nuanced research agenda for further advancements. To conduct a quantitative literature review, this paper employs bibliographic coupling on a sample of 615 Web of Science peer-reviewed articles on academic entrepreneurship. To conduct a comprehensive interpretation of the bibliometric findings, I perform additional hierarchical clustering of the frequent terms and content analysis of the publications. The results indicate that the academic entrepreneurship research field is based on four interconnected clusters: (1) the anatomy of an entrepreneurial university and its main components, (2) university spinoffs and technology commercialization, (3) the identities of academic entrepreneurs and their motivations and barriers in entrepreneurial activities, and (4) knowledge transfer and regional economic impacts. These findings are of high importance to academics who seek to enhance entrepreneurial processes and to policymakers interested in stimulating academic entrepreneurship. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-26 14:56:06","","237-265","","1","120","","Scientometrics","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","","","Bibliometrics; Knowledge transfer; Academic entrepreneurship; Bibliographic coupling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IP management is an important issue, as it both enables and restricts the utilization of research results and impacts the competitiveness of technology-based businesses. The literature review shows that previous studies of IP management in TTOs tend to adopt a simplistic view of IP management, recommending that all valuable inventions should be patented. Moreover, academic research into TTOs and actual TTO practices both appear to focus on improving efficiency and outputs measured in terms of numbers of patents, licenses and spin-offs. We call this established view the appropriation mode of TTOs and question it based on the logics of publicly funded research and modern IP management. In its place, we suggest the utilization mode of TTOs, in which TTOs manage IP from publicly funded research in order to govern innovation processes and enable utilization of research results in a broader sense. Several recommendations are provided for both researchers and practitioners. © 2019 The Authors","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","","","","59","","Technol.

Methodology: Following a systematic review of the current literature, and using a quantitative methodology, supported by a pragmatist theoretical approach, this study used an online anonymous survey to gather the views and perceptions of university academic staff about the entrepreneurial maturity of their own institution specifically, and more generally about the knowledge management factors which can promote entrepreneurialism in academic institutions in developing countries. Findings: The findings indicated that although the case example university was perceived as progressing well towards its aim of becoming an Entrepreneurial University, it was evident that institutions such as this face a number of barriers which is perhaps more prominent in a developing country like Jordan, where higher education is still more commonly viewed through a traditional lens. However, the findings indicated a good level of support for the use of entrepreneurial centres to act as business incubators, and there was an appetite for forging stronger links with businesses and on learning outside of the traditional university context. Furthermore, the findings suggested that the focus towards entrepreneurialism had led to improvements in knowledge transfer and application processes in particular, but that going forward academia and industry alike need to continue to adapt and change, align and strengthen knowledge management, and work collaboratively to achieve the archetype ""third mission"" with mutual benefits for all. Originality: There are limited studies of university entrepreneurialism within developing countries and the exploration of barriers and enablers that impact upon entrepreneurship within universities more generally. This study therefore makes a makes a valuable contribution towards the strategic debate on entrepreneurial universities. © 2019, Allied Academies.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","","","2","25","","Acad.

From the analysis of the body of literature on the topic, exploration and exploitation emerge as critical processes in the development of entrepreneurial universities. Nevertheless, the way they are balanced within universities is an under-researched topic. Adapted from the concept of organisational ambidexterity, this paper develops the notion of university ambidexterity to analyse the development process of entrepreneurial universities. To achieve this research aim, a conceptual model is developed by integrating the learning processes of exploration and exploitation to the previous theories used to analyse the entrepreneurial university. As already emphasised in other studies focusing on the role of ambidexterity in different research contexts, this paper proposes an idea of balance over time. The universities need to balance exploration and exploitation in their evolutionary path towards the entrepreneurial model, but it may be not necessary to invest in exploration and exploitation processes simultaneously. On the contrary, it may be most important to oscillate between periods of exploration and periods of exploitation to achieve ambidexterity over time. As a result, the tensions between exploration and exploitation processes generate a twisting learning path for entrepreneurial universities. Finally, the paper proposes an integrated conceptual framework which consists of six constructs, namely internal organisational environment, external environment, university exploration, university exploitation, university ambidexterity, entrepreneurial university performance. The proposed research hypotheses on the interrelationships between the mentioned constructs and the mediating role of university ambidexterity constitute potential areas of investigation to direct future empirical research and further develop the body of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurial universities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-26 14:36:54","","172-194","","","141","","Technol.

Method: We analyzed data from 01/2014 to 05/2019, including HRCTs from 239 medical centers in 12 European and Asian countries that were transmitted to our Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) via a secured internet connection. Structured reports were generated in consensus by a radiologist with over 20 years of experience in thoracic imaging and a pulmonologist with specific expertise in interstitial lung disease according to current guidelines on IPF. Reports were sent to referring physicians. We evaluated patient characteristics, technical issues, report turnaround times and frequency of diagnoses. We also conducted a survey to collect feedback from referring physicians. Results: HRCT image data from 703 patients were transmitted (53.5% male). Mean age was 63.7 years (SD:17). In 35.1% of all cases diagnosis was “UIP”/”Typical UIP”. The mean report turnaround time was 1.7 days (SD:2.9). Data transmission errors occurred in 7.1%. Overall satisfaction rate among referring physicians was high (8.4 out of 10; SD:3.2). Conclusions: This Eurasian teleradiology program demonstrates the feasibility of cross-border teleradiology for the provision of state-of-the-art reporting despite heterogeneity of referring medical centers and challenges like data transmission errors and language barriers. We also point out important factors for success like the usage of structured reporting templates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","","","","121","","Eur.

However, turning those discoveries, innovations, and inventions into commercially viable products can prove extremely difficult. Based on a systematic review and narrative synthesis of the literature on translational research: the different models, its practice, and the efforts to streamline it, the author proposes a novel translational research & development framework to better link university science and engineering research to commercial outcomes, i.e., to create a more seamless transition from research to business. The author identified the best practices in translational research (as encountered mostly in biomedical research), adapted them for use in more general science and engineering research contexts, and combined them with well-established best practices in project management, new product development, business development, science of team science, and intellectual property management. The result is a robust, structured framework that can help university investigators bring their ideas to market. The proposed framework is also relevant to university investigators who might not intend to turn their early-stage innovations into businesses, but rather advance the development of the innovations to the point where they become attractive for others (e.g., entrepreneurs, industry), to embrace the challenge of developing the innovations further for the market. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:16","2025-07-25 13:43:16","","1-18","","","53","","J Eng Technol Manage JET M","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","Technology transfer; Commerce; Academic entrepreneurship; Engineering research; Human resource management; Project management; Research and development management; Business development; Commercialization; Intellectual property management; Development frameworks; New product development; Product development; Science and engineering; Translational Research; Translational research & development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study provides a systematic review of a recent research stream addressing the development, growth, and performance of university spin-offs. By critically analyzing 105 research papers published since 2000, this paper makes two main contributions. First, we present a conceptual framework outlining the variety of outcomes used in the literature to assess the development, growth and performance of university spin-offs, as well as the determinants of these outcomes at different levels of analysis. Second, we critically assess gaps in the extant literature and discuss promising directions for future research.

The conventional e-learning approaches have become insufficient to handle the requirements of upgraded learning processes especially in the higher education. The emergence of Cloud computing delivers a significant breakthrough and has gained considerable acceptance in e-learning field. However, despite the readiness of Cloud infrastructures for collaboration and wide accessibility such as Web 2.0 tools, the progress of redefining learning objects to suit e-learning in Cloud environment is not so encouraging. So far, there has been rather little activity being carried out to ensure that e-learning applications are being designed in such a way that promote flexibility use of the learning content. With the availability of Internet and Cloud computing, an e-learning framework utilizing Cloud technology is envisioned. This paper describes a study on the effects of content design and usability on the acceptance of proposed Cloud-based e-learning framework. The study was conducted on a group of 350 IT undergraduates in one of the private universities in Malaysia to evaluate the acceptance of the proposed frameworks. The students were given one trimester to experience the usability of the learning modules developed based on the proposed Cloud-based e-learning framework. As an instrument to analyse the effects of content design and usability on the framework acceptance, a questionnaire consisting twenty four questions was devised and used. There are two independent variables, namely Content Design (CD) and Usability (U), and one dependent variable, namely Acceptance (A), in the research instrument. The results were analysed and reported by running the data in a few statistical tests using SMARTPLS 3.0. The results from this study observed that Cloud-based e-learning modules developed based on the proposed Cloud learning framework is positively accepted by IT undergraduates in the private university. This implies that the proposed Cloud-based e-learning framework can be engaged in the development of a new e-learning infrastructure or application in the future. © The Authors, 2018.

Open innovation highlights the concept of networking as enterprises position themselves in an inside and outside double process of knowledge acquisition and diffusion to foster their own new activities development and possibly those of their partners. This co-innovation approach may involve close known partners (customers, suppliers, regular interlocutors among others), entities purposely contacted (this includes academic structures specifically associated to a project, distant companies holding complementary know how and start-ups) and also occasional or fuzzy contributors (members of social networks, specialist mobilized by internet innovation intermediaries among others). Open innovation is associated with some theoretical problematic including the question of the necessary abilities of people in charge of this process. Beyond the technology and business competencies required within any innovation process, this paper focuses on possible complementary skills linked with the plurality of structures involved. The aim is to elaborate a competence’s list of reference dedicated to people piloting open innovation, and, to test this referential through new learning modules. The first step of the research consists in testing the hypothesis of the existence of specific open innovation management abilities. Based on a literature review and considering the work of the standard organization) in the field of innovation management (ISO/TC279), the research focuses on sensing practices that are typical of open innovation dynamics. These practices are then linked with a set of competences (knowledge and know how) thanks experts and company members interviews and according to a bibliographic analysis. Hence a competence referential is proposed for open innovation managers. In a second step, this referential has been valorized to design a new pedagogical module added to the syllabus of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure en Génie des Systèmes et de l’Innovation (ENSGSI) a French engineering school dedicated to innovation and management of technology. The paper gives the results of a two years’ experience about open innovation learning with students at final engineering level (master degree). The module uses the pedagogical concept of formative assessment: five evaluation sequences are integrated to the module. Each associating the students themselves, professors and employees of companies applying open innovation strategies. This transverse assessment is discussed all along the module by these three groups of people involved in order to get a continuous feedback. The outcomes of this evaluation process are detailed and analysed in constructivist terms: do the module gives students new abilities and are the competencies adapted to the launching phase of an open innovation process? In conclusion, the hypothesis of specific abilities relating to open innovation is validated. But the generic status of each of the competencies seems questionable. The wide range of openness situations suggests a necessary contextualization when identifying the pertinent targeted competencies of open innovation managers. © IAMOT 2019.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","95-105","","","","","","","","","","","Excel India Publishers","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Manag.

Using a combination of topic mapping, author and journal co-citation analyses, and overlay visualization of new and hot topics in the field, this article makes important contribution to the entrepreneurship research by identifying 46 topics in the 24-year history of entrepreneurship research and demonstrates how they appear, disappear, reappear and stabilize over time. It also identifies five topics that are persistent across the 24-year study period––institutions and institutional entrepreneurship, innovation and technology management, policy and development, entrepreneurial process and opportunity, and new ventures––which I labeled as The Pentagon of Entrepreneurship. Overall, the analyses revealed patterns of convergence and divergence and the diversity of topics, specialization, and interdisciplinary engagement in entrepreneurship research, thus offering the latest insights on the state of the art of the field. © 2018 Yanto Chandra.

Healthcare policy and other decision-making relevant to PTB may rely on obsolete, incomplete or inapplicable research evidence, leading to worsened outcomes. Appropriate knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) strategies are an important component of efforts to reduce the global PTB burden. We sought to develop a 'landscape' analysis of KTE strategies currently used in PTB and related contexts, and to make recommendations for optimising programmatic implementation and for future research. Methods: In the University of California, San Francisco's Preterm Birth Initiative, we convened a multidisciplinary working group and examined KTE frameworks. After selecting a widely-used, adaptable, theoretically-strong framework we reviewed the literature to identify evidence-based KTE strategies. We analysed KTE approaches focusing on key PTB stakeholders (individuals, families and communities, healthcare providers and policymakers). Guided by the framework, we articulated KTE approaches that would likely improve PTB outcomes. We further applied the KTE framework in developing recommendations. Results: We selected the Linking Research to Action framework. Searches identified 19 systematic reviews, including two 'reviews of reviews'. Twelve reviews provided evidence for KTE strategies in the context of maternal, neonatal and child health, though not PTB specifically; seven reviews provided 'cross-cutting' evidence that could likely be generalised to PTB contexts. For individuals, families and communities, potentially effective KTE strategies include community-based approaches, 'decision aids', regular discussions with providers and other strategies. For providers, KTE outcomes may be improved through local opinion leaders, electronic reminders, multifaceted strategies and other approaches. Policy decisions relevant to PTB may best be informed through the use of evidence briefs, deliberative dialogues, the SUPPORT tools for evidence-informed policymaking and other strategies. Our recommendations for research addressed knowledge gaps in regard to partner engagement, applicability and context, implementation strategy research, monitoring and evaluation, and infrastructure for sustainable KTE efforts. Conclusions: Evidence-based KTE, using strategies appropriate to each stakeholder group, is essential to any effort to improve health at the population level. PTB stakeholders should be fully engaged in KTE and programme planning from its earliest stages, and ideally before planning begins. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","","","1","15","","Health Res.

Design / Methodology / Approach: We use the SSF-Systematic Search Flow method, which is applied in systematic and integrative reviews. Results: An entrepreneurial university, committed to the development of its region, is the key factor in achieving regional innovation, a key institution in knowledge-based societies. In the age of knowledge, the university is as important as industry and government; fundamental for the development of knowledge and innovation. As a result, we identified research challenges and opportunities, contributing to the construction of a panorama of Brazilian scientific production in international journals on the themes entrepreneurial university and third mission. Limitations of the investigation: The most important limitation in this study was the long-time collection of research data. Practical implications: Universities must strengthen their relationship with industry and government to transfer knowledge and, at the same time, demonstrate their contribution to the community, fulfilling their third mission, as a vector for regional socioeconomic growth.

Universities are facing new issues due to the increase in distance & online education. Therefore, they are trying to attract and retain students by providing facilities like learning factory (LF). Learning factory being a platform for knowledge creation & learning, it also creates an environment for interaction between students, academics, and industrial participants. It is essential to understand how knowledge creation takes place within learning factory settings. Knowledge creation is a process of generation of new ideas, and studies are broadly within industrial organization thus ignoring educational context such as within university. Therefore, it is crucial for the university to take this challenge and address these gaps, which is above mentioned, i.e., identifying a model and its applicability. We have conducted qualitative research, which includes a detailed literature review, workshop, informal interview and focus group with participants. A literature review has shed lights on the advanced model of knowledge creation, and this model is based on a framework of the unified theory of dynamic knowledge creation through SECI mode, ‘Ba,' knowledge assets, and Leadership or simply known as Nonaka's model. The workshop reports on knowledge creation and applicability of this model in learning factory setting. The finding shows that a unified theory of dynamic knowledge creation model fits our existing learning factory setting with minor adjustments to serve our local industries. In summary, this paper applies the unified theory of dynamic knowledge creation model for the learning factory settings and from findings; it highlights the importance of the application of the knowledge creation to develop the education system and the role of management in learning factory settings. The results of this research should interest both management of university and industry for shaping their learning process and continuous knowledge creation. © 2018 Academic Conferences Limited.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","888-896","","","2","","","","","","","","Academic Conferences Limited","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data from a more comprehensive research, whose objective was to evaluate the scholarship programmes of São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). For data collection, the authors used an online questionnaire, pre-filled with information from the Lattes Curriculum of the sample individuals, as well as information obtained from FAPESP and from coordination for the improvement of higher education personnel. The response rate of the questionnaires was 21 per cent. The authors sought to explore the variables regarding entrepreneurial activities carried out by former scholarship holders, by relating them to other key variables identified in the literature review and explained in the hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that entrepreneurship rates decrease with the higher academic level of the researcher; in general, academic entrepreneurs come from families with a good financial situation, and applied sciences are the areas of knowledge with more entrepreneurs. Originality/value: Despite the great number of theoretical and empirical studies found in the literature on entrepreneurship and academic entrepreneurship, there is still a shortage of practical studies on this latter topic in Brazil. This gap is even more evident when the authors consider the significant growth of entrepreneurial activity in the country in the past years.

Our investigation aims to answer the following RQ: “How is relational capital formed in universities? How is it managed?” From a methodological point of view, we start with a literature review on relational capital and then we develop a case study. As far as the literature review is concerned, a search on Scopus was conducted, using a set of selected keywords, because it guarantees a high quality for publications. Selected papers have been analysed in an attempt to identify the main issues. The case study is a research strategy particularly suitable for an in-depth examination of current real-life events. The case chosen focuses on the foundation and development of the scientific observatory on gender issues entitled “Ipazia”. All relationships built in order to merge research, teaching and third mission within universities will be analysed and discussed. The analysed case study allows us to investigate whether and how the use of relational capital enables universities to combine research, education and third mission. Meanwhile, our research highlights how “Ipazia” can be seen as an activator of relationships for gender studies. Our research project aims to extend the analysis of relational capital in universities. This project could allow us to gain a greater understanding of a relevant subject, especially for those, scholars or politicians, who are involved in developing, managing and measuring relational capital in universities. Finally, this paper contributes to the expansion of the literature on gender studies, and for this reason, it offers a new perspective applied to a topic of high relevance such as relational capital in universities. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","203-221","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Springer Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature on informal ties, internal knowledge base and radical innovation provides the theoretical foundation of the research framework and hypotheses. Using a sample of 158 China’s university spin-offs, the authors conduct a regression analysis on the theoretical framework and hypotheses. Findings: The results show that business and university ties are positively related to radical innovation. Moreover, the effects of business and university ties on radical innovation are contingent on knowledge breadth and depth in opposite ways. In particular, the positive effect of business ties on radical innovation depends significantly on internal knowledge depth rather than on knowledge breadth, and the positive effect of university ties on radical innovation will be affected by internal knowledge breadth rather than knowledge depth. Practical implications: Managers of university spin-offs must examine informal ties they already have and identify their nature, content and embedded advantages and promptly adjust their strategy of informal ties to adapt to their firms’ internal knowledge base. Originality/value: This study highlights the positive role of managers’ personal connections with different external parties in facilitating radical innovation and advances the understanding of informal ties by proposing that the effects of informal ties on radical innovation are contingent on a firm’s internal knowledge base in the context of China’s university spin-offs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-26 14:37:09","","778-801","","4","13","","Chin.

Second, to present a novel mapping approach to identify technology-relevant research based on the papers cited by and referring to the SNPRs. Design/methodology/approach: In the review part we discuss the context of SNPRs such as the time lags between scientific achievements and inventions. Also patent-to-patent citation is addressed particularly because this type of patent citation analysis is a major element in the assessment of the economic value of patents. We also review the research on the role of universities and researchers in technological development, with important issues such as universities as sources of technological knowledge and inventor-author relations. We conclude the review part of this paper with an overview of recent research on mapping and network analysis of the science and technology interface and of technological progress in interaction with science. In the second part we apply new techniques for the direct visualization of the cited and citing relations of SNPRs, the mapping of the landscape around SNPRs by bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis, and the mapping of the conceptual environment of SNPRs by keyword co-occurrence analysis. Findings: We discuss several properties of SNPRs. Only a small minority of publications covered by the Web of Science or Scopus are cited by patents, about 3%-4%. However, for publications based on university-industry collaboration the number of SNPRs is considerably higher, around 15%. The proposed mapping methodology based on a ""second order SNPR approach""enables a better assessment of the technological relevance of research. Research limitations: The main limitation is that a more advanced merging of patent and publication data, in particular unification of author and inventor names, in still a necessity. Practical implications: The proposed mapping methodology enables the creation of a database of technology-relevant papers (TRPs). In a bibliometric assessment the publications of research groups, research programs or institutes can be matched with the TRPs and thus the extent to which the work of groups, programs or institutes are relevant for technological development can be measured. Originality/value: The review part examines a wide range of findings in the research of patent citation analysis. The mapping approach to identify a broad range of technology-relevant papers is novel and offers new opportunities in research evaluation practices.  © 2017 Anthony F.J. van Raan.","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","13-50","","1","2","","J.

This is even more prevalent for Systems of Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems, because of multi-disciplinary co-engineering processes. Such situations often lead to information scattering across many heterogeneous and interconnected models, or to overlappings and redundancies that may create inconsistencies in system descriptions. Thus, engineers may have difficulties to efficiently comprehend the studied systems as they need to explore all these models in full detail. View-based approaches in software engineering have been proposed to tackle these issues. They mostly follow a strategy of proposing a fixed set of predefined viewpoints to be used in different application domains or scenarios. This offers several advantages such as improved understanding, or more integrated and comprehensive tool support. However, these approaches lack the flexibility required in many scenarios where the useful model views go beyond a limited set of viewpoints, and may change over time as the development process moves on. Recent advances in model-based engineering have fostered the possibility of having more flexible view-based approaches, based on metamodeling and model transformation techniques for instance. These model view approaches typically support the creation of custom views over heterogeneous models. However they differ in their mechanisms to create such views (calculated on-demand, stored as separate models, etc.), the expressivity of the view definition language, the support for view updates, etc. Given the plethora of existing approaches-most of them only providing partial solutions-it is difficult to know how each approach compares to the others and what are their respective trade-offs. This makes it difficult to identify which one(s) may be better suited for given needs, thus hampering the usefulness of such model views approaches in practice. In this paper, we provide orientation via an extended study of the state-of-the-art in the area of model viewpoints/views. We believe this research line is becoming more and more crucial not only for the modeling community, but also from a more general software and systems engineering perspective. Thus, we motivate why many future applications of modeling will depend, one way or the other, on some kind of mechanism for dealing with viewpoints/views on models. Furthermore, we describe what are the solutions available at the time of writing and how they currently compare to each other. To this intent, we categorize them according to a detailed feature model that aims to shed more light on this topic. Finally, we propose a research agenda highlighting related challenges we have identified as important to tackle in the future. In addition to overall scalability issues, such challenges includes (i) dealing with terminology problems that quite often hamper the combination and reuse of existing initiatives, (ii) addressing the well-know but still complex view updating problem(s), (iii) better supporting incremental view maintenance in the general case, (iv) improving the generation of adapted view concrete syntaxes, and (v) working on security-related aspects (e.g., view access control). This paper acts as an entry point for both academic researchers and industrial practitioners, and intends to trigger a broader discussion within the community. This should allow enriching our current feature model and extending the approach comparison in the future. Most importantly, we hope this work will raise the awareness on research challenges around viewpoints/views on models and their practical usages. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","211","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - ACM/IEEE Int.

Moreover, governmental policy makers tend to support measures for early-stage ventures or university spin-offs, based on the assumption that sustainable energy technologies primarily arise from early-stage technology development. Attention has recently been shifting to SMEs, which can help accelerate the energy transition. By combining a literature review with an explorative multiple case study of 20 SMEs in the Dutch sustainable energy sector, this article identified barriers and drivers for technology commercialization by SMEs. A country-specific barrier is the large consumption of natural gas by Dutch households, which strongly inhibits the successful scale-up of new technologies. The study found several managerial, financial, technological and policy-related barriers and drivers which affect technology commercialization of sustainable energy technologies by SMEs. These barriers and drivers were further assessed in an actor-based analysis, which suggests that the various barriers and drivers arise from the interactions between policy makers, industry partners and end-users. The paper also discusses the policy implications of the barriers and drivers identified, and outlines several challenges for future research. © 2019 The Author(s)","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","114-126","","","112","","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Technology commercializations; Barriers; Renewable energies; Energy policy; Decision making; Energy conservation; Technology commercialization; Barrier; Driver; Drivers; Electric energy storage; Energy sector; Policy makers; Small and medium-sized enterprise; SMEs; Sustainability transition; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study will use bibliometric analysis based on actual joint initiatives and their published results. The growth of interest from both universities and industry in joint initiatives and changes in the nature of their cooperation (Butcher & Jeffren, 2005) has led to a significant increase in the Baltic Region and the number of scientific publications has doubled in the years 2010-2014. However, compared to the number of similar published studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Japan, those results far outnumber the achievements of the Baltic regions. At the same time, there has been significant increase in the number of studies undertaken by Sweden, Germany and Finland in the period from 2012 to 2014, facilitated by active international and interdisciplinary cooperation and involvement in the research by a large number of authors. The results of the evaluation indicators through this bibliometric analysis can assist in the specific targeting and allocation of available finance and funding into promising fields of research and aid in communication and cooperation between stakeholders and interested organisations. © 2017 Elena Murashova et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2017.","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","28-58","","2","7","","Baltic J.

The country made an early entry in the small satellite scene with the launch of its first academic 1U nanosatellite - Libertad 1 - in 2008. More recently, the Colombian Air Force launched its first educational 3U advanced nanosatellite - FACSAT1, in November 2018. The mentioned projects have contributed as the initial building blocks of the future capacity in this matter, in order to project Colombia as a space-faring nation and leader in the Latin American region, by considering its strategic geographical position and the composition of its human critical mass. The Colombian Air Force, through its FACSAT small satellite educational program, is allocating budget and coordinating efforts involving national universities, different government agencies, civil authorities, and Minister of Defense actors, to strengthen the national policy while the next generations of small satellites will be launched into orbit. What is more, an intense technology transfer program is underway through international cooperation to acquire state-of-the-art know-how and ensure implementation of best practices. The strategy above described is followed in many emerging and developing countries, where military forces can act as the best-input channel for international cooperation and drive the creation of space capabilities and know-how. This applies not only for national defense, but also for other usages such as research in different topics in terms of climate change effects, whether, agriculture, and so on. The FACSAT small satellite educational program is a long-term investment that aims at developing all the capacities needed to give Colombia frequent access to space. This paper will present an overview, the context of the country and the efforts undertaken with respect to national policy, regulatory matters, academic outreach, R&D capacity building, as well as the general defense framework allowing this to happen. Besides, it will also feature a focused presentation of the FACSAT1 and FACSAT2 Earth Observation projects. These two first projects are contributing and benefiting the Colombian society, especially from the processing and exploitation of imagery, to convey services with great value in different arenas, as never done before.

Various countries have taken different steps for promoting technopreneurship. On this backdrop we have attempted to explore the promotional efforts in various countries and the factors which enhance propensity of technopreneurial activities. To address these research questions, we have identified research articles on technopreneurship in different countries and systematically reviewed them. Few European countries have begun providing entrepreneurship education at the higher stages of academia. In some nations governing bodies are set up to help budding entrepreneur grow their business, incubators are set up in various national institutes, and the concept of the entrepreneurial university has also emerged. Investment in Research and Development has also been looked as initiating step for technopreneurship in many countries. This will create an ecosystem of technopreneurship and will help improve the economy of a nation by generating more number of jobs after setting up of more number of MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) in the field of high technology. These programs are also likely to help an individual think more towards the improvement of the community and not only about profit making. We have found that the efforts by various countries are dependent on their regional priorities.

This article aims to explore scientific literature on innovation and entrepreneurship in the academic setting, describing how the field is organized, main terms and definitions, theoretical frameworks, and empirical models, in order to direct future research. A systematic literature review was conducted, in which articles indexed at Web of Science were initially submitted to a bibliometric analysis. Then, the content of a set of articles best fitting the objectives of the study was analyzed. Bibliometric analysis shows an increasing literature, with publications over more than 40 years. There are studies from many disciplines, with those in business and economics prevailing, mainly related to management and originating from the USA and Europe. Content analysis shows a fragmented literature, with definitions not showing a clear relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship, or their use within universities in coherence with their traditional definitions. Both theoretical frameworks and empirical models are very heterogeneous, but four groups of studies were identified based on their theoretical frameworks, and also based on their empirical models. With only a few exceptions, empirical models do not share many components and variables, and there are no clear boundaries between the different models. Despite the increasing literature, it is still fragmented and undertheorized, requiring more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the economic and the social aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship within universities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2017","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-26 14:55:12","","369-395","","2","13","","Int.

The last decade, the European Union has funded more than 140 million euros for research in innovative ITS and C-ITS technologies through the HORIZON 2020 funding mechanism.Taking into account the significance of ITS and C-ITS technologies, in the frameworks of the CAPITAL project, an ITS knowledge database has been introduced in order for a common framework to be provided for the deployment of ITS and C-ITS. The ITS knowledge database is presented in the form of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) through the CAPITAL Online Training Platform, developed in the standards of other online training platforms. The solution of MOOCs has been chosen due to the fact that more and more platforms, either university platforms or not, are already introduced for providing educational programs.The ITS knowledge database consists of nine independent topic studies, with each one aiming to describe the current state of the art of ITS and C-ITS. The aforementioned topic studies are the following:•Introduction to ITS and C-ITS.•ITS and C-ITS user services.•TMC and roadside technologies for ITS.•Communication technologies for ITS and C-ITS including relevant standards.•Impact assessment of ITS and impacts of selected ITS and C-ITS systems•Financial incentives, business models and procurement models for C-ITS deployment.•Cost-benefit analyses of ITS services.•Guidance in deploying ITS and C-ITS.•Data protection and privacy.The topic studies mainly take the form of literature reviews and they are presented as video lectures. They address all ITS stakeholders, divided by their know-how level into three categories: 1st level ITS start-up communities, 2nd level intermediary communities and 3rd level professional users. The educational and informational material is customized for each individual know-how level. Every trainee has the possibility to evaluate the concept of online training tools as well as the effectiveness of this specific tool both before and after the attendance to each course. Moreover, various quizzes have been developed based on the material of each lecture separately in order to measure the level of knowledge and the information that the trainees gain after each lecture.Within this paper, a first thorough analysis of the feedback of the participants-trainees is being presented and a consequent evaluation of the effectiveness of the platform is being executed in order to identify the efficiency and the success of such an online tool. The level of awareness and demand for ITS technologies is being measured through descriptive statistics that conclude to useful results for both the material of the courses as well as the usefulness of an online training tool for ITS. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: MT-ITS - Int.

This has meant that universities now have to become more entrepreneurial in offerings, outlook and culture. However, a core actor in this process who is often overlooked is the academic. The ability of an academic to effectively transfer knowledge to industry is key to universities achieving their entrepreneurial mission and ambition. This paper explores the changing roles of academics to identify key distinctions between entrepreneurial academics and academic entrepreneurs. This is done through a systematic literature review spanning 25 years drawing on selected high impact journals in innovation, entrepreneurship and higher education studies. We categorise the types of activity that academics typically engage in and identify the motivations and challenges they face. From this, we identify two types of academics, the entrepreneurial academic and academic entrepreneur.

In this article several case studies are analysed, as well as relevant academic literature, to get an insight concerning the current relationship status between enterprises and universities. Methodology/Approach: The methodology is grounded on the literature review on University-Industry Partnerships, selected from indexed sources, and targeted to case-based experiences where practical feedback is given. Findings: It is shown that university-industry knowledge transfer contributes significantly to an increase of quality, productivity and economic value of businesses. It is found that the lack of controlling mechanisms and lack of efficient communication paths have a strong negative impact in collaboration. Key collaboration factors that support stronger relationships were compiled and discussed in support of better mitigation strategies. Research Limitation/implication: The limited availability of case studies reporting on operative improvements introduced by policy changes hinders the effectiveness of the findings. Originality/Value of paper: The paper analyses the collaboration of the university with industry based on case studies with a focus on value creation and how to gain a competitive advantage through collaboration.

This research investigates the effect of expatriation on knowledge transfer as a driver for innovation and performance. The study uses the case of international faculty in a higher education institution to shed light on the interplay between sharing international experiences, facilitating knowledge transfer, and generating value. Following a thorough literature review, research on knowledge transfer processes within the education sector remains limited. We still have little guidance on the mechanisms enabling knowledge transfer inside universities, particularly when promoting faculty mobility or hiring international faculty and researchers. This research adopts a single case study method while using Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, an international higher education institution, as a context of investigation. The study involved international faculty from the schools of engineering, business, and humanities and also Moroccan faculty who received their education abroad to explore the processes of experience and knowledge sharing among diverse workforce and how such processes could lead to creating a space for knowledge transfer that enables in turn better innovation and performance. The findings of this research show the limited knowledge transfer dynamics inside internationally-oriented higher education institutions and demonstrate the importance of adopting human resource development practices as facilitating mechanisms to support knowledge transfer while involving and benefitting various stakeholders. The study suggests different developmental venues for universities to support knowledge transfer from international faculty including teamwork, training and faculty orientation, collaborative research projects, resources and incentives, and industry-oriented educational and consulting programs. This research has the potential to lay the foundations of a theoretical framework integrating knowledge transfer and value generation dynamics within the context of higher education. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-26 14:57:33","","423-431","","4","38","","Hum Syst Manage","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: IOS Press","","","","Research; innovation; Innovation; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Higher education; knowledge transfer; Human resource management; Knowledge; Personnel training; Expatriation; international faculty; performance; workforce diversity; Workforce diversity; Business And Economics--Management; Studies; Expatriate; Expatriate employees; Human resources; Mobility; Study abroad; Training and development; University faculty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of recent EE research and scholarship is followed by an empirical study to develop a model of EEPs. This was adopted by employing an emergent inquiry perspective incorporating participatory action research, using frame analysis and NVIVO to develop and analyse themes. Findings: This research identified three unique dimensions currently excluded from the theoretical and scholarship of EEPs, being distinct contextualisation, entrepreneurship ecosystems and recent content innovation in entrepreneurship. It also identified updates to current EEPs dimensions, such as online technologies, authentic alignment, causation, effectuation and bricolage, technology transfer the entrepreneurial university. Research limitations/implications: The discussion and model presented in this paper may be a starting point for future empirical studies on EEPs, by developing additional validation, justification and legitimisation. Practical implications: The study indicates that EEPs are integrative and dynamic, and always limited to contextual and contemporary inferences; providing guidance to developing such programmes. Hence, the applicability to update the original framework developed by Maritz and Brown (2013) as Part 2 of illuminating the black box of EEPs.

Although majority of these satellites are planned to be manufactured in advanced countries, growing number of developing countries are expected to join the wave as well. There have been many advanced countries and companies willing to provide training and technology transfer to new entrants who do not have domestic capability. However, most of emerging countries are still experiencing difficulties in establishing sustainable self-standing capability. This presentation is about the journey of Satrec Initiative (SI), a small satellite company from Korea, spun-off from a university research center which also started as a recipient of space technologies. It is about the lessons learned along the journey, and how SI moved on to become a donor by exporting and transferring space technologies. The early members have acquired the seed technologies from the universities in the UK, US, and Japan. After 30 years, SI has become one of the most important small satellite companies in the world developing wide range of technologies: from world-class Earth observation satellites to state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms for satellite imagery analytics.

Although academic interest in embedded agency has increased in recent years, what enables actors to engage in embedded agency is still not well understood. One resource that may assist actors in realising embedded agency and overcoming political resistance by opponents to change is management accounting, as management accounting can—among other functions—serve as an important information resource for actors willing to engage in embedded agency. Although the existing literature may not explicitly refer to embedded agency, published research studies are likely to already contain some evidence of the role of management accounting as a resource in institutional work. Thus, this study seeks to survey and re-analyse the existing literature for evidence regarding how management accounting may be used as a political resource that enables embedded agency. For this purpose, the study uses systematic literature review methods and demonstrates why and how management accounting may serve as a political resource in institutional change. The study develops six roles concerning how management accounting may be used as a political resource in the identification of a need for and gaining others’ support for and the implementation of institutional change. It further shows that management accounting may be at interplay with other factors in enabling embedded agency. Finally, the review findings suggest that management accounting may be an important resource not only in legitimising institutional change ex post but also in identifying the need for change, gaining others’ support for change and implementing change. © 2017 The Author(s)","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-26 14:43:19","","22-38","","","38","","Manage.

Through a literature and practice review, we identify micro- and macro-dynamics of open innovation in addition to the dynamic roles of industry, government, university, and society. In particular, the industry continuously adopts open platforms to create and maintain ecosystem innovation. The government's role has changed from regulation control toward facilitation. Universities have become proactively engaged in multiple areas, from technology transfer to knowledge co-creation. Societies and customers have started to form new concepts, R & D, and commercialization, resulting in a shared economy. Based on the analysis, we propose a conceptual framework to understand open innovation micro- and macro-dynamics with a quadruple-helix model for social, environmental, economic, cultural, policy, and knowledge sustainability. Furthermore, this provides an overview of the special issue, ""Sustainability of Economy, Society, and Environment in the 4th Industrial Revolution"", which aims to respond to the 4th industrial revolution in terms of open innovation and cyber-physics from manufacturing to the service industry. © 2018 by the authors.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","","","12","11","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","","","","Sustainability; innovation; literature review; university sector; technology transfer; numerical model; Open innovation; sustainability; conceptual framework; commercialization; industrial regulation; Innovation ecosystem; Macro dynamics; Micro dynamics; Quadruple-helix; regulatory approach; service sector","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The New Public Management (NPM) reform in the public sector has stressed the importance of performance information to politicians, public managers, and citizens. Information economics has acknowledged the meaning of information as a market determinant. However, as a discipline, information economics has not developed a cost concept that describes the negative value of an incorrect decision caused by the non-use or misuse of information. A systematic theoretical approach describing the factors causing such non-use or misuse is also currently missing in information economics. This article aims to fill these two research gaps. It defines infonomic costs (ICs) as the negative value of information non-use or misuse, denoting the benefits lost by the decision maker. By conducting an exploratory literature review, another new concept called the information expectation gap (IEG) is created to depict why the non-use or misuse leading to ICs occurs. The IEG also explains how information and knowledge asymmetries come into existence. The conceptual work presented here offers novel understanding and terminology to both academics and practitioners. Practitioners can utilize the IEG concept in information system management because it displays several dysfunctions that they may face in their information systems. For academics, this research opens up new theoretical conversations about the different types of information system dysfunctions that cause market errors and adverse policy decisions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2019","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","104-125","","1","10","","J.

Thus, qualified PhD students play a pivotal role in this process. Moreover, the nuclear energy industry encounters ceaseless real-world state-of-the-art problems, and academic researches generally feed on them that would finally become the PhD students' theses and dissertations. Therefore, the paradigm for intimate university-industry partnership is required. The university-industry collaboration system provides an effective approach to cultivating high-level talents for the nuclear energy industry. Since 1996, Tsinghua University (THU) has cooperated with companies such as China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to enroll 60 students orientated to the nuclear energy industry every year, approximately10%-15% of which would subsequently pursue doctoral degrees. This paper will illustrate, build, optimize and investigate the training mode for PhD students majoring in the nuclear science and engineering based on the university-industry collaboration system in THU. The newly established training mode includes some vital elements like the nine-year persistent system, four-supervisor cooperative cultivation and project-oriented exploratory research.

Drawing upon the notion of robustness in social systems and public choice theory, we review, code, and taxonomize 166 studies to assess the likelihood that these initiatives will generate innovation and economic growth. We find that academic entrepreneurship initiatives are characterized by conflicting goals, weak incentive structures for universities and academics, and are contextually dependent upon factors such as university strength. Our results suggest that there are critical boundary conditions that are unlikely to be fulfilled when universities and policymakers enact policies to support academic entrepreneurship initiatives. Policymakers therefore need to be cautious in the potential design of such initiatives.

Students are hired to work in the laboratory or field to gain experience, fulfill their educational requirements, and reduce the financial burden for their education. The safety of student researchers is commonly regarded as a top priority and is an important part of their education for their future careers. While on-campus laboratory safety for students is commonly stressed by many universities, field site safety is rarely mentioned. A study led by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) was conducted with assistance from Oregon State University (OSU) and Portland State University (PSU) to create a safety training manual and video for student workers and researchers who perform roadway engineering fieldwork. The study revealed safety education and training needs for students. To carry out field data collection, students may be required to work on a roadway, in the right-of-way, or close to live-traffic environments. Workers and researchers present on roadways are exposed to hazardous conditions which present the need for safety training to increase the skill level, hazard awareness, risk perception, and quick reactions of those conducting work operations. Unlike work conducted by permanent employees, work conducted by student workers and researchers typically involves temporary, short-term assignments, so students often only receive informal safety training when required to collect data in the field. Formal safety training resources are needed to provide students - who are the future employees of the transportation industry - with adequate knowledge and skills to ensure that they know how to work safely on roadways. This paper describes current practices related to student worker safety training and the results of a survey conducted to collect the perspectives of onsite engineers and experienced managers on student safety training needs. Conclusions and recommendations are reported based on safety training in university curricula, a comprehensive literature review, and the survey results. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2018","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","","","4","144","","J Prof Issues Eng Educ Pract","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","","","Students; Technology transfer; Surveys; Engineering research; Human resource management; Risk perception; Data acquisition; Personnel training; Accident prevention; Department of Transportation; Field data collection; Hazards; Occupational risks; Oregon State University; Permanent employees; Roadway engineering; Traffic environment; Transportation industry; University curricula","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new industrial era requires skills and competencies in state-of-the-art technologies which are constantly and rapidly evolving. This research presents an alternative approach to the current teaching–learning methodologies, focusing on the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as an educational tool and its contribution towards the upcoming industrial challenges, via what we call interactive education for future engineers (IE). Our IE strategy is supported by interactive simulation using the latest VR technologies, currently being Facebook’s Oculus Rift hardware and software. With this approach, we seek to enhance the “know-how” of our students by training them in the practical skills they will need for the technological innovations of the evolving labor market. Our work has been implemented in engineering courses at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, aligning with the university’s educational model “TEC21” which aims to increase the students’ self-learning capabilities using interactive teaching and hands-on practical work to develop new abilities and competencies in an expanded variety of domains. So far, our results have shown that the use of IE not only improves the way professors teach, but reinforces skills, competencies, enhances creativity and strongly motivates the students in their daily learning. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:17","2025-07-25 13:43:17","","1395-1410","","4","14","","Int.

While physical activity (PA) is proposed as a cost-effective method to alleviate problems after moderate to severe TBI, there is no review to date that synthesizes the evidence for PA in the community-based context. Further, although sex- A nd gender-based considerations in research are considered requisite to good science, there is no review on PA and TBI that has included this explicit focus. Objective: The purpose of this review is to map and synthesize the current evidence identified through a systematic search of community-based PA interventions for individuals of all ages with moderate to severe TBI and provide an overview of that evidence by asking the following research questions: (1) what are the characteristics of community-based PA programs for individuals with moderate to severe TBI, (2) what are the reported health-related outcomes and measurement tools used to evaluate them, and (3) what considerations have been given to sex and/or gender? Methods: Searches will be conducted of six academic databases for peer-reviewed articles. Two reviewers will independently screen the articles for inclusion and extract data for the analysis. The extracted data will be coded according to the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template checklist and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist to provide sufficient detail for replication. Results: The abstract screening was completed by two reviewers and the extracted data were analyzed. A qualitative synthesis and description of community-based PA interventions for individuals with moderate to severe TBI will be provided. Conclusions: This scoping review will generate new knowledge from published and publicly available literature. Dissemination of the results will include activities related to knowledge transfer for community-based PA after moderate to severe TBI for future research and practice. Evidence-based recommendations, future directions, potential limitations, use of online/digital components, and the possible need for a systematic review will be discussed as well. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc..

For the past 20 years, the concept of green manufacturing has grown from infancy to a fully formed framework agreed upon by world-leading enterprises. With the unprecedented development of the information technology today, the industrial data collected could assist in the in-depth study on green manufacturing, which ranges from the operations of machining tools all the way to supply chain management. The wide scope of research promises a tremendous amount of annual publications in this field. To better facilitate follow-up research work, the present study provides a systematic overview of green manufacturing-related areas, including research progress and the developed features. The article set retrieved from the Web of Science contains 5989 documents related to green manufacturing. It is revealed that Journal of Cleaner Production is the most productive journal, archiving documents within the scope of green manufacturing. P. R. China tops the list of the number of documents with 1357 documents (22.66%), while Zhejiang University is the most productive institution. As the cooperation network indicates, P. R. China and the United States maintain the strongest collaborative links with other countries/regions. Finally, possible future directions are recommended based on the findings in the study. For instance, additive manufacturing technology and industrial IoT both have a great potential in green manufacturing; the weak link between the disciplines of manufacturing engineering and environmental science is expected to be strengthened, and a stronger international cooperation is believed to be beneficial to the field for the otherwise isolated countries/regions. © 2021 Zhejiang University of Technology.

SE courses established at the university level with a combination of cooperation from the local community and industry give a more effective impact on the local community. The knowledge and skills taught from universities regardless of the academic or cultural background can be used to balance the social problems in the community with the development of social innovation to solve the issues. However, several challenges delayed further development of a successful SE programme in higher education. This research employs the systematic literature review (SLR) which utilizes in-depth and absolute evaluation of related literature on the research topic. Four challenges have been encountered include; the design of SE curricula, financial and funding problems, lack of professionals to teach SE courses, and prohibitive social and university environment issues. This research has also suggested some best practices include; more SE awareness programmes, university management in solving funding problems, preparing SE coaching professionals, and setting up more university-industry collaborations. This paper proposes suggestions to counter the challenges and leverage the social network as an innovative technological alternative and giving more opportunities for improved social benefits. © 2020 National Institute of Education, Singapore.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-25 13:43:18","","588-604","","3","42","","Asia Pac.

A scoping review based on the Joanna Briggs Institute’s guiding principles, using Krueger’s intention-based entrepreneurship model as the theoretical framework, was undertaken to determine the extent of the literature related to characteristics, attributes, behaviours, enablers, and barriers of academic entrepreneurship in Higher Education Institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Twenty articles were identified and included. The most common academic entrepreneurial characteristics included hunger for success, desire for independence, innovation, creativity, futuristic thinking, and self-esteem. For entrepreneurship to flourish, donor support, strong regulatory systems, political and macroeconomic stability were necessary. Characteristics such as innovation, creativity and futuristic thinking were tied to academic entrepreneurship. Further research on enablers and barriers is suggested to guide academics in LMIC universities with their transition to entrepreneurship as their engagement with society develops. © 2021 The Author(s).

Universities are one main component of the national innovation systems and entrepreneurship ecosystem. In that sense, universities, have a fundamental role in fostering innovation culture, producing required knowledge, nourishing talent, supporting startups to become entrepreneurial, and serving industry. The aim of this paper is to study how universities become entrepreneurial. The concept of entrepreneurial university was closely examined through literature review and study tours and interviews at four universities: TU Graz in Austria, University of Turku and Aalto University in Finland, and TU Berlin in Germany. The results produced highlighted the different entrepreneurial activities these universities perform and what it takes to become an entrepreneurial university. For a university to become entrepreneurial, it needs to acquire strategic commitment in terms of leadership buy-in, adjustment of organizational structure, culture and policies, and detailed planning. The university also needs to allocate or acquire the necessary financial, human, physical and digital resources. In addition, the university needs to deliver entrepreneurial awareness, education, and research. Moreover, the university also needs to support startups at their different stages through various services. Furthermore, the university must have a strong industry orientation in terms of being aware of industry needs, having a solid Intellectual Property's policy, technology commercialization infrastructure, and performing collaborative research with industry. Finally, the university needs to have a regular impact assessment and evaluation followed by an action plan for improvement. Copyright © 2021 by Naudé Scribante.

Current challenges in manufacturing metrology can be summarized in five keywords: fast, accurate, reliable, flexible, and holistic. Moreover, modern non-generative production methods such as five-axis milling may need different inspection strategies for reliable quality assurance. Standardized strategies refer to the most relevant 2D-sections, single helix, and profile line inspection, which has been state of the art for many decades. These methods are still relevant and continue to deliver high performance gears, but other options are becoming available. Modern coordinate metrology systems such as CMMs or GMMs gather holistic information about dimension and surface form of gears with high point density and accuracy in a short time. Currently, however, we do not know how to use this holistic information. This paper introduces a 3D evaluation strategy for cylindrical involute gears used at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. The focus is on describing the holistic evaluation of synthetic and measured data. Considering the complete gear surface in one common model allows us to a) determine deviations along the whole flank, b) obtain more relevant and stable geometrical fitting parameters, c) find correlations between gear fitting parameters and d) properly understand possible manufacturing errors. The paper also shows how Newcastle University's Design Unit used holistic evaluated data to investigate gear surface harmonic analysis methods. Harmonic analysis of 2D profile and helix measurement data is routinely used by some industries to control gear noise and characterize machine tool performance, but the evaluation of 3D surface measurement data has not been investigated. A review of some candidate methods using synthetic and measured data is presented and some of the challenges interpreting the results is discussed.

This paper aims to support that transition and to address related challenges by the presentation of a new progression model, which provides guidelines for the development of courses at the tertiary level with an entrepreneurial university approach. The construction of the new applicable model is central to the purpose of this study and based on a systematized literature review. Additionally, the input–process–output–outcome framework, originally constructed for the evaluation of educational programs, was adapted to the incorporation of an overall framework into the new model. In the results, the paper redefines some of the relevant core terms, such as “entrepreneurial education” and its “progression model”.

Hence, in many industries, spin-off are used to realize technological developments. Space Industry is considered to have a very high level of spin-off potential due to its leading-edge nature, a large palette of involved industries and technologies in it, the basis of high-tech management skills, as well as the level of intellectualism in the labour force involved. Space spin-offs having higher productivity are the ones involved outside the space industry, especially in academic, government and commercial sector. According to the available literature, there are four types of spin-offs: Start-up, direct technology transfer,university spin-offs and corporate spin-offs. This paper analyses space spin-offs and their success rates comparing the mother company size and the spin-off type. The research is done in the form of a meta-analysis of the available literature about space spin-offs summarizing the success rates of space spin-offs to act as a guide for space companies aiming to start spin-off and help them decide the best spin-off option for their situation. © 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

The authors collected 511 documents from the Web of Science and analysed them using Bibliometrix, an RStudio package for performance analysis and science mapping. The study aims to provide an overview of the evolution of research about this topic and describe the structures (i.e., conceptual, social, and intellectual) characterising it. It discusses the results to identify the main areas addressed so far and highlight gaps in the literature, offering avenues for possible future research. The results show that publications on entrepreneurial universities started over 30 years ago and show an increasing trend, more than tripling in the last 10 years. Considering authors and documents as a unit of analysis, the US and Europe perform well in terms of productivity and relevance, but the phenomenon is globally relevant. The contribution to socio-economic development, especially in developing countries, is a hot topic for future studies. Despite increasing production rates, research on this topic remains fragmented, justifying the need for more systematisation. Furthermore, the paper offers policy makers and practitioners a useful baseline for developing entrepreneurial universities and considering their technological, managerial, and organisational implications. © 2020","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-26 14:47:51","","","","","165","","Technol.

However, they often lack technology, know-how, and funds to afford state-of-the-art data collection equipment for collection and analysis of road deficiencies. The paper describes the development of a localized road damage detection model using the transfer learning method and assessment of its usability for training the detection model from a local road image dataset of a limited size. Localized road damage dataset is created by capturing 3,923 Czech and Slovak road images containing 5,072 instances of detected road damage using a smartphone installed on the vehicle's windshield. Then, a supervised neural network was trained using the road damage dataset labeled by experts. A pre-trained MobileNet model developed by the University of Tokyo and transfer learning method were employed to accelerate the training process and to improve the model's performance when a relatively small, localized dataset is used. Finally, the performance of the developed road damage detection model was analyzed. The results show that it is possible to capture road damage into preset classes with accuracy based on the F1-score ranging between 45% and 98%. Further improvement in the detection rate can be achieved by increasing the training dataset size. The developed road damage detection model is publicly available on https://github.com/amraz39/RoadDamage DetectorCZ and it shows the high potential of employing deep neural networks in the detection of road damage by local road agencies. © 2020 ACM.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-25 13:43:18","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

These modifications are known as “digital transformation” (DT). On a much greater scale than DT, the world was changed in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, which re-organised society in the way of thinking, acting, producing, consuming and creating new business. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) were no different, since these institutions had to make changes to the student–lecturer interaction; teaching–learning, where DT had a relevant role, above all in academic entrepreneurship. Therefore, this study aims to propose a framework showing the structural pillars of the link between digital transformation (DT) and academic entrepreneurship (AC) (DT-AC Framework). This framework identifies the new patterns, methods, skills and other discoveries in aspects such as management, information systems and culture sciences. The intention is not to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic imposed global structural changes, but because of it, lecturers and students found their DT accelerated and intensified, and so it is necessary to investigate the pillars supporting academic entrepreneurship. The results show that DT was already emerging as a basic element of academic entrepreneurship before the pandemic, but the process has speeded up. This bibliometric study indicates the structural pillars that support entrepreneurship following the Covid19 pandemic, as created from DT in universities, providing an extensive systematic review that indicates the cause and effect of the academic entrepreneurship process. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-26 14:47:54","","1159-1182","","1","27","","Educ.

Design/methodology/approach: This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process. Findings: As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education. Research limitations/implications: There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models. Originality/value: The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature. © 2020, Vinícius Rosa Cota, Cleiton Lopes Aguiar, Bezamat de Souza Neto and Miguel Benegas.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-25 13:43:18","","177-195","","2","17","","Innov.

Although the fact of requiring the adoption of IFRS could be characterised as a form of coercive power, recent developments in IT help to explore the extent to which adoption and diffusion of IFRS is shaped by agency, the interests of actors involved in the adoption process, and the role of institutional entrepreneurs and institutional work. We provide a structured review of literature that uses an IT framework in the context of adopting and implementing IFRS. The review brings together various streams of IT and current debates in the management and organisation literature. This allows us to outline an agenda for future research that proposes six new research questions for investigation. These research questions are intended to encourage greater regard for the capacity of the theoretical toolkit of institutional logics to explore institutional entrepreneurship, institutional work, and the institutional dynamics of change processes associated with the adoption, maintenance and disruption of accounting systems. © 2020 Asociación Española de Contabilidad y Administración de Empresas (AECA).","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-26 14:52:37","","65-88","","1","50","","Revista Espanola Financiacion Contabilidad","Teoría institucional y NIIF: una agenda para futuras investigaciones","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Routledge","","","","Accounting; Institutional theory; Institutional work; adopción; adoption; change process; G17; G29; G30; IFRS; implementación; implementation; NIIF; proceso de cambio; Teoría institucional; Accounting software; Accounting standard; Business And Economics--Banking And Finance; Compliance; Institution; International accounting standards; International Financial Reporting Standards; Organization theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until recently, however, related insights into the dynamics of this relationship in respect of the specific role of the science park have been limited. This paper presents a systematic review identifying the key roles of each actor in relation to innovation. We link the dynamic roles performed by the university between science parks and the RIS. Our results enable us to identify how the key activities performed by the university change during its interrelations within the RIS and with the science park. Our analysis of the literature distinguishes between three sets of relationships through which the university plays differing roles: RIS-university, RIS-university-science park, and university-science park. Respectively, the University’s relationships between these different RIS actors focuses on: resource sharing, brokerage, and commercialisation-exploitation. Secondly, we find that within each of these relationship types the university can perform three types of roles: on knowledge co-creation, acting as conduit, and inter-organisational relationship building. Distinguishing between these differing relationships and roles enables us to identify a total of nine dynamic roles performed by the University, which include: provision of information, channels of communication, infrastructure, regional networking, building research collaboration, acting as knowledge intermediaries, economic development, technological change and commercialisation processes, and start up creation and commercialisation. The review identifies several gaps in the literature in need of further research, and suggests that university relationships with RIS, interlinked with those between the university and science park itself, are important factors affecting science park innovation performance. © 2021, Crown.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-25 13:43:18","","2017-2050","","6","46","","J.

European universities and public research organisations (PROs) prove less performing than colleagues from the USA and this lag has been a major policy issue for European institutions in the last two decades, since R&D investments do not yield appropriate returns in terms of intellectual property, licenses and spin-out companies. Barriers to successful technology transfer are relevant and technology transfer offices (TTOs) as intermediaries in the technology market are underperforming. While studies have been conducted in technology management literature to identify barriers, so far there seems to be a lack of a holistic tool that help measure and improve TTO’s performance. In an effort to provide such tool, we use the CCODE® methodology and adapt it to TTOs. Based on an extensive literature review, we identify five factors that are generally considered determinants of the performance and develop what could be the basis for a diagnostic tool able to help single TTOs and their PROs identifying areas where changes could be made to improve their performance.

However, collaborations often meet unproductive performance and unsmooth interactions due to gaps in research capability, goals, and working protocols. To reduce the risks of deterioration in collaboration, executives need to foresee possible gaps in advance so that relevant solutions can be planned. This paper introduces the 3-phase analytical approach to manage the university-industry collaboration (UIC). The first phase involves assessing the matching quality of university partners. Next, the assessment result is diagnosed to detect the matching quality gaps. Then, the third phase applies the assessment results to 1.) position university partners into the proper mode of collaboration; Orchestrated collaboration, Assistive collaboration, Attentive collaboration and Mismatched collaboration, according to their complementarities and compatibilities and 2.) craft a strategic roadmap guiding the relationship development toward effective UIC with selected partners. This 3-phase approach helps managers realize possible difficulties and systematically prepare solutions in advance. © 2022 PICMET.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-25 13:43:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: PICMET - Portland Int.

Technical measures play a critical role in design and management, where the set of technical measures is relied upon as an indicator of the project state for decision making, risk assessment, evaluation, and forecasting. Given the criticality of technical measures, it is important to know how to choose the “right” measures. This research answers the question: what guidance is published on how to select technical measures for the design of large-scale complex engineered systems in academic literature? A systematic review is performed, identifying relevant sources through a formalized process that includes all sources that satisfy predetermined inclusion criteria, rather than including sources that support a desired finding, resulting in evidence-based data to understand the current guidance for technical measures selection. One hundred ninety-eight guidance statements for selection for technical measures for the design of large-scale complex engineered systems are identified from the systematic review and analyzed via content analysis. It is identified that the current guidance for the selection of technical measures is high level, most often focusing on qualities that the measures should exhibit and identifying from where the measures are derived. Specific, practical guidance is lacking, leaving the selection of a critical piece of systems design largely up to the best judgment and experience of the systems engineer. The contribution of this research is an overview of published guidance for the selection of technical measures and identification of gaps in guidance that future research can address.

At the same time, it is challenging for engineering faculty to instruct lab report writing because they are often under-supported in writing pedagogies and usually unfamiliar with the extent of students' prior writing knowledge. Literature review: Literature on technical communication in engineering addresses the importance of a rhetorical approach to writing instruction, as well as an emphasis on genre. Extending this literature, research into writing transfer provides valuable insight for better understanding how undergraduates negotiate the engineering lab report as a new genre within this distinct rhetorical context. Research questions: 1. How effective is a transfer-focused writing pedagogy in supporting students' understanding of the genre conventions of engineering lab reports? 2. How does the transfer-focused writing pedagogy impact students' writing quality in five categories (rhetorical knowledge, organization, evidence, critical thinking, and disciplinary conventions)? 3. What are the rhetorical features that engineering students improve or struggle with the most with lab report writing? Research methodology: Four engineering instructors and two English instructors participated in this study to design and develop the lab report writing instructional module, and implemented the module materials into their engineering lab courses. The module, consisting of lab report writing instruction and assessment resources, shares a rhetorical approach and foundational writing terms with first-year composition courses to emphasize a writing-transfer pedagogy. We collected and analyzed undergraduates' lab report samples to evaluate the impact of the module on students' writing performance. Two sets of lab reports were collected for analysis: the sample sets before (control), during the 2015-2016 academic year; and after (experimental) implementation of the module, during the 2016-2017 academic year. Results and conclusions: Data collected via pre- and post-implementation writing artifacts show that a rhetorical approach to teaching lab reports helped students better understand the expectations of the lab report as a discipline-specific genre, and it developed students' understanding of the rhetorical features of engineering writing. The pilot module positively impacted the quality of students' lab reports, a finding that suggests that using a transfer-focused writing pedagogy can successfully support the transfer and adaptation of writing knowledge into gateway or entry-level engineering laboratory courses. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-25 13:43:18","","64-84","","1","63","","IEEE Trans Prof Commun","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","Engineering education; Students; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; Curricula; Teaching; knowledge transfer; Engineering faculty; Engineering laboratories; Engineering laboratory report; engineering writing; Laboratory course; Report writing; Research laboratories; rhetorical knowledge; Rhetorical knowledge; Student writing; Technical writing; Writing instruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reach this aim, the comparative literature review of the factors influencing the performance of the TTOs was performed first. The survey along with the semi-structured interviews interviewing leaders of the TTOs with the aim to validate the relevance of the factors was conducted afterwards. The discussion on the key factors influencing the performance of TTOs at ECIU members is presented at the end of the study. The study reveals the following as the key factors influencing the performance of TTOs at the ECIU network: i) TTO strategy; ii) relationships with investors; iii) networking; iv) functioning of a special TTO unit dedicated to working with industry; and v) business experience of TTO staff. It also brings an extension to the technology transfer literature by discussing organizational issues of technology transfer in the European context.

The paper concentrates on the activities of Norwegian construction conglomerate Moelven Brug, which in the 1950s brought back the production of laminated timber in Norway after 40 years of absence in the country. Building on the work of Norwegian glulam pioneer Guttorm Brekke (1885– 1980) and on state-of-the-art academic research and industry know-how from the United States of America, Sweden, and Belgium, in the post-war period Moelven Brug quickly established itself as the market leader for laminated timber in Norway. By mapping these scholarly and professional exchanges, the paper traces the shifting ontological understanding of timber in Norway from a “natural” to a “scientific” material and its transformation into a complex assemblage of different substances subject to control and standardization through a series of variables and parametric values. © 2021 the Author(s).","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:18","2025-07-25 13:43:18","","735-742","","","2","","","","","","","","CRC Press/Balkema","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Hist.

However, such logic might be understood as a dominant regime that leads to unsustainable systems. We intend to contribute to transitions research by focusing on the agency of social enterprises as non-dominant actors searching for challenging and transforming the institutionalized logics in the business system. Therefore, we disentangle the institutional mechanisms driven by social enterprises by proposing a theoretical model built upon a literature review of sustainability transitions from institutional perspectives, offering a set of explanatory propositions to allow empirical examination. Those mechanisms and propositions operate at three levels: inside the individual, inside the niche, and at the interplay between the niche and the business regime.

University technology transfer offices (TTOs) oversee the process of technology transfer into the commercial marketplace and these organizational units can be considered in the context of enabling effective knowledge management. However, what enables productive TTO performance has not been comprehensively researched. Therefore, this research study adopted the knowledge-based view as the theoretical construct to support a comprehensive investigation into this area. This was achieved through employing a systematic literature review (SLR) combined with a robust meta-analysis. The SLR identified an initial total of 10,126 articles in the first step of the review process, with 44 studies included in the quantitative synthesis, and 29 quantitative empirical studies selected for the meta-analysis. The research study identified that the relationship between TTO knowledge management and knowledge deployment as well as startup business performance is where TTOs secure the strongest returns. © 2020 by the authors.

The Australian Remote Operations for Space and Earth consortium (AROSE) undertook an in-depth national review of advanced technology, capabilities and processes in the field of Remote Operations. The study included applications across many industry sectors including Agriculture, Defence, Health Services, Manufacturing, Resources (Mining and Energy), and Space. The aim of this multilateral capability study was to support the growing Australian Space industry to solve common Space exploration challenges utilising Australia's world leading Remote Operations. This paper provides an independent capability baseline to catalyse cross industry growth in Remote Operations. The report outcomes will facilitate technology transfer and collaboration between traditional sectors and the burgeoning Australian Space industry. This paper was developed in collaboration with leading industry and academic experts in Agriculture, Defence, Health Services, Resources (Mining and Energy), and Space industries, who either utilise or supply Remote Operations capabilities and/or enabling technologies. Our methods included, but are not limited to, stakeholder interviews, consultation with subject matter experts, literature reviews, and the aggregation of public data. It was clear from this capability study that end-to-end Remote Operations in Australia is world-leading and cuts heavily across multiple major sectors to improve safety, reliability, productivity, and sustainability. Fundamentally, the same challenges faced by many of the sectors, particularly Mining and Energy, are mirrored by the Space industry for missions focused on foundational and construction services, exploration and excavation, and In-Situ-Resource-Utilisation (ISRU). Solving these cross-sector challenges through multi-lateral collaborations will enable a broader impact on complementary industrial sectors and Australia's Space industry. This Remote Operations capability study significantly improved the understanding of current capability in Australia and the spin-in/spin-out opportunity for Space operations. The report identifies the benefits and emerging challenges for industry in the field of Remote Operations and identifies the opportunities for, and from, collaborative Space exploration activities.

The main task of research is to offer practical tools for maintaining research integrity as elements of the internal and external quality assurance system of education and research. One of the working hypotheses of the study is the correlation between the quality of educational activities at the university, the quality of research and the level of interest of customers of innovative developments in the process of transfer and commercialization of research results. The first two components are determined by the “purity” of research through the implementation of the principles of research integrity. The schematic relationship between the individual goals of sustainable development characterizes the relationship “university − the quality of research − technology transfer – industry”. A logical scheme between research integrity, technology transfer and procedures for internal and external research quality assurance is proposed. The abstract-logical method and the method of induction-deduction were used to analyze the relationship between the concepts of “quality of scientific activity”, “technology transfer” and “research integrity”. Bibliometric analysis was performed using SciVal and VOSviewer tools based on data from the scientific-metric databases Scopus and Web of Science. Based on the bibliometric analysis, it was found that the query “research integrity” identifies the main violations of research integrity and shows a strong link between the quality of research and success in the transfer of knowledge and technology from university to industry. The main problems of the development of technology transfer between the university and industry at the national level are analyzed. A separate block of problems related to research integrity is identified. The case of the national university on creation of university system of maintenance of research integrity and development of infrastructure of maintenance of scientific activity within the limits of the specified system is resulted. The results of the work can be useful for the triangle “business education-science” to reconcile the interests of all the “vertices” of the triangle under the mandatory condition-ensuring the quality of educational and research activities in universities as centers of intellectual potential. © 2021 by the author.

In this paper, a literature review is applied in order to derive the state of the art of university platforms for knowledge management. Based on this, the purpose of such platforms is analysed. The results indicate that knowledge transfer focuses on teaching, research, and transfer activities. Often, e-learning platforms are used to facilitate cross-university transfer of knowledge. The motivation to use such platforms is to share knowledge, to make use of synergies in cooperation and to gain more visibility.

In this sense, EO should also be increasingly integrated into the university's role. Thus, this study sought to contribute to state-of-the-art development about university EO using a systematic literature review. The aim is to analyze the literature on university EO to identify key trends in the literature, gaps in the literature and define a research agenda.

The subject matter of the study was organisational culture and innovation at universities. The subjects were four selected universities in Poland, Austria, Germany, and Ukraine. The paper provided a definition of organisational culture and its typology. It further discussed the organisational culture of universities and the relationships between organisational culture and innovativeness. The literature review provided foundations for building a model for the formation of a type of organisational culture at universities that is innovation-friendly, which is the added value of the paper. It offers actions worth taking to shape innovation-friendly culture at universities. It is particularly important during difficult time of changing labour market, when universities greatly impact the attitudes of young people. The knowledge of how to shape innovation-friendly organisational culture at universities is necessary for academia to profile future employees in times of continuous changes. To investigate the relationship between organisational culture and the innovativeness of universities, we designed an original survey questionnaire [S1 File]. Organisational culture was diagnosed with the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument by K.S. Cameron and R.E. Quinn. The analyses were conducted in Dell Statistica v. 13.1 (StatSoft Polska). We normalised data from the Likert rating scale using Kaufman’s and Rousseeuw’s formula. We used Spearman’s correlation coefficient and Kendall’s W to calculate correlations. The research shows that the investigated Polish and Austrian universities are dominated by hierarchy and market cultures. On the other hand, the German and Ukrainian universities host all cultures, but clan and adhocracy dominate there. Moreover, the analyses demonstrated that although the adhocracy culture was the least visible in the investigated organisations, it contributes to university innovativeness the most. The conclusions were used to build a model for promoting innovation-friendly organisational culture at universities. The model contains answers to the research questions. In addition, it offers guidelines for shaping organisational culture to bolster innovation at universities. The research identified relationships between organisational culture and university innovativeness and components that create innovation opportunities at universities as its contribution to management theory.

An assumed means of responding to the challenge is through the entrepreneurial university model, which adds a third mission to HEIs: to contribute to economic, technological and social development. Therefore, governments across the globe promote this ideal through system reforms and funding schemes, while HEIs ignite institutional changes. Publications also explore the entrepreneurial university model, although some scholars have criticized the new mission and its implied commercial orientation. However, little is still known about how HEIs are applying the model to become more entrepreneurial. Therefore, this article presents a systematic literature review comprised of a meta-ethnography on the transformation journey of 36 HEIs across 18 countries. The outcome is a four-stage iterative action-framework proposition, suggesting that exogenous and endogenous forces constantly influence HEIs which, in response, ignite experiments, requiring sensitization to be consolidated and later institutionalized, in an endless, long and rather slow process. This article contributes to theory by explaining the metalevel of HEIs’ entrepreneurial pathway process and to practice by providing policymakers and decision makers in HEIs with an analytical framework. © The Author(s) 2020.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","14-27","","1","35","","Ind.

To better understand this contribution, we present a systematic review, together with bibliometric and network analyses of the academic entrepreneurship literature. This provides a map of the main topics approached by scholars, thereby illustrating the scientific scenario of the field. Our findings identify three highly interconnected research activity domains that characterize the multidimensional features of entrepreneurship in the academic setting, as well as a significant gap in the literature regarding studies evaluating approaches to support the navigation of potential scientific discoveries to the market. We organize our findings into a four stages framework consisting of: idea inception; the recognition of how this idea unlocks value for customers and other stakeholders; development of an innovative business model; and a commercialization strategy that creates real impact. We discuss the relevance of each stage for the establishment of a more innovation-friendly environment and conclude by offering perspectives into future research opportunities and by encouraging studies that consider the academic entrepreneurship process from a systemic perspective, to support a greater contribution of academic institutions to the economic and social development of the nations and societies. © 2021","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-26 14:45:12","","","","","173","","Technol.

The automotive industry as well as many other key industries have also been greatly influenced. The rapid development of automotive industries in Europe have created wide industry gap between European Union (EU) and developing countries such as in South East Asia (SEA). Indulging this situation, FH JOANNEUM, Austria together with European partners from FH Aachen, Germany and Politecnico di Torino, Italy are taking initiative to close down the gap utilizing the Erasmus+ United Capacity Building in Higher Education grant from EU. A consortium was founded to engage with automotive technology transfer using the European framework to Malaysian, Indonesian and Thailand Higher Education Institutions (HEI) as well as automotive industries in respective countries. This could be achieved by establishing Engineering Knowledge Transfer Unit (EKTU) in respective SEA institutions guided by the industry partners in their respective countries. This EKTU could offer updated, innovative and high-quality training courses to increase graduate’s employability in higher education institutions and strengthen relations between HEI and the wider economic and social environment by addressing University-industry cooperation which is the regional priority for Asia. It is expected that, the Capacity Building Initiative would improve the quality of higher education and enhancing its relevance for the labor market and society in the SEA partners. The outcome of this project would greatly benefit the partners in strong and complementary partnership targeting the automotive industry and enhanced larger scale international cooperation between the European and SEA partners. It would also prepare the SEA HEI in sustainable partnership with Automotive industry in the region as a mean of income generation in the future. © IEOM Society International.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","2970-2972","","","59","","","","","","","","IEOM Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Construction enterprises, being pillars of China’s economy and confronting the challenge brought by the strategy of “going out”, the call for their technology or management innovation was broadly pronounced across practical and academic fields. Social capital (SC), as a resource in a social network, is the basis for creating sustainable competitiveness and advantage for enterprises. The innovative achievements and innovation performance (IP) of enterprises are largely determined by their SC. To achieve competitiveness in the market, enterprises must carry out knowledge transfer (KT) with the other members of their networks. However, few scholars have examined weather SC has any effect on IP in construction enterprises. Using a KT perspective, this paper explored how SC affects the IP of construction enterprises. Based on the literature review and analysis, a conceptual model was constructed and validated using structural equation modeling (SEM). Through empirical analysis, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) SC has a positive impact on the IP of construction enterprises. Among them, the structural dimension (SD) and cognitive dimension (CD) have a significant positive impact on the IP of construction enterprises, while the relational dimension (RD) does not. (2) The SD, CD, and RD of construction enterprises’ SC have a positive influence on KT. (3) There are mediating effects of KT between SC and IP of construction firms, and they are partial. KT plays a partial mediating effect between SD, CD, and IP of construction firms. The research results can not only improve an understanding of effects of SC on IP of construction enterprises, but also validate the importance of KT in stimulating IP. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, to date, the number of studies investigating these relationships in a joint manner, showing how the result varies in different contexts, is still rare. This systematic literature review analyses the existing academic literature on the relationship between technology transfer, absorptive capacity and organisational performance by carrying out a bibliometric and qualitative analysis of the literature. The bibliometric analysis provided an overview of the literature, identifying the most prominent and influent journals, countries, institutions, authors and research methods, as well as intersections between the constructs and the temporal evolution of the publications. The qualitative analysis was employed in order to understand, systematise and assess the previous findings on the subjects. The results showed that absorptive capacity is an important factor for effective technology transfer, when taking into account international technology transfer, university-industry collaboration and inter-organisational transfer. The literature converges in indicating that both technology transfer and absorptive capacity have a positive impact on organisational performance, although some existing exceptions need to be considered. Finally, the study provides an agenda for future research based on contextual, methodological and theoretical gaps identified.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-26 14:58:02","","","","2","26","","Int.

In the transition from research outcome to innovation, information about the entrepreneurial opportunity is important because the outcomes of academic research are distant from the marketplace: as they have not been conceived with consideration of practical use but solely in a quest for understanding a scientific phenomenon. This underpins the rationale for our study into the information conditions regarding the entrepreneurial opportunity in the context of the prevailing property rights regime. In addressing this issue we adopt a theory-led realist synthesis approach to the conduct of a systematic literature review. Whilst we find empirical evidence supporting the conclusions of theoretical models, i.e. the strengthening role of technology transfer offices, we also point to their shortcomings. We go on to argue that significant gaps in our knowledge, and thus our ability to act, remain. In response, we advance an agenda for future research that focuses on the exploration of alternative policy actions (interventions) that draw from different paradigmatic lenses and methodological approaches. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","1487-1513","","5","46","","J.

However, there are various viewpoints related to the aspect of online classes as not much of comparative studies on real classes and online classes have been carried out in Bahrain. Therefore, the need for a research study to find out the merits and demerits of real classes and online classes was identified. The objective of the study was to find out the reasons behind the preference of a class of HRM students of Gulf University, Kingdom of Bahrain with respect to the mode of its imparting – whether it is the real classes or online classes. A class of a HRM course was taken as a sample with the same faculty handling real classes before the midterm exam and online classes after midterm exam so that analysis could be carried out on the responses of the same set of students exposed to both the modes of teaching imparted by the same teacher. With an exhaustive literature review to trace the emergence of online classes and the impact of the same on the current generation, the study recorded the students’ responses in the form of a survey questionnaire. The quantitative analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and the variables were tested for the significance of the relationship using the Pearson Chi-Square test. The findings implicitly confirm that the students are comfortable with both real classes and online classes as far as the instructor is efficient to use appropriate pedagogies and digital tools to support learning. © 2020.

Unprecedented challenges have been redesigning the missions of Universities, which are often perceived as being at a crossroads. The TM is a multidisciplinary, complex, evolving phenomenon linked to the social and economic mission of Universities in a broad sense. Existing studies mainly focus on Universities in accomplishing their traditional missions, or they offer a narrow perspective of the TM. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic literature review has been performed on the TM to comprehensively explore its heterogeneous functions, constraints, clashes and incorporation within education and research. This paper presents a systematic review of the state of knowledge and develops a novel framework for the enactment of the TM. The paper reveals the potential and the constraints of the recurring themes of the TM, focusing especially on the engagement of non-academic stakeholders. It also suggests, to scholars and policymakers, a selection of measures through which some of the challenges might be faced. The paper offers both a descriptive and a thematic analysis, through examination of 134 peer-reviewed articles which were published between 2004 and May 2019. © 2020 The Authors","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-26 14:42:25","","","","","161","","Technol.

This ranking was designed and developed by the Russian Union of Rectors following a direct request from President Vladimir Putin. The objective of this work is to perform a threefold analysis of this ranking. First, a methodological analysis is carried out, focused on describing the nature of the indicators and sources employed. Second, a geopolitical analysis aims to determine how countries are represented in this new global ranking. Third, a webometric analysis is done, focused on the online visibility of the ranking. The results reveal MosIUR to be a ranking with an outstanding number of webometric indicators and clearly oriented towards transference to society. However, some methodological concerns arise regarding a few metrics. The geopolitical position of developed countries is similar to that in other global rankings, but slight differences emerge, such as the stronger presence of Russian universities. The cybermetric analysis confirms that, despite being international, this ranking is strongly limited to Russia. It can be concluded that, except for the palpable predominance of the USA, each ranking tends to place universities from their own country in a better position. The creation of MosIUR by the Russian government can thus be perceived as a political strategy to improve the reputation of Russian universities, increase funding, and accelerate their transformation into world-class universities. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The systematic literature review outlines 35 articles in the period from 2000 to 2018. Qualitative case studies have been the main research method so far, and about half of the research at Nordic universities has been conducted in Sweden. Most research has focused on commercial aspects of the Third Mission, but neglected social components and indirect, less visible activities such as popular-science publications or participation in policymaking. Little research regarding TM has been conducted in humanities or social sciences.

In this paper, we approach the third mission (TM) of the university in the sense of its contribution regarding the knowledge transfers towards the community and society. We set out to achieve this general goal by discovering those key elements of academic leadership, related to the third mission, that can exert an influence on the entrepreneurial potential of the university towards regional community (starting from students, alumni, teachers, SMEs, society as a whole). The need for this research comes from the reality that universities are being pushed by educational, social and economic challenges to increasingly strengthen the link between theory and practice even through entrepreneurship. Having the role of trainers for future generations, universities have the chance but also the responsibility not only to encourage young people to embrace entrepreneurship but also to prepare them well. The applied research method is a bibliometric literature analysis and a network analysis by using VOSviewer, a specialized software. This research method enables the visualization of previous research patterns thus the conceptual clusters retrieved from the papers analyzed provide the grounded arguments for our research. In order to extract the necessary information for the purpose of the research, we performed the bibliometric analysis in Scopus database in the period 2015-2020, in order to identify and analyze the current perspectives on the subject presented by other authors. We applied this type of bibliometric literature analysis because it facilitates us to highlight several research directions, namely: which are the most discussed issues related to academic leadership and entrepreneurship, which are the shortcomings in discussions on this topic, which are the connections with practical research or which are the emergent issues on the topic. Based on the results, we reached our own conclusions and proposals regarding the academic leadership in the direction of entrepreneurship. In essence, we believe that the university, throughout its third mission (TM), has the potential to be a powerful engine for entrepreneurship development and we will argue the main approaches identified in this direction. The bibliometric analysis also revealed the gradual evolution of concepts in the analyzed period of time and various connections between the concepts discussed in Scopus database articles. A novel concept approached recently is the ‘entrepreneurial ecosystem’ which is being connected to the entrepreneurial agenda of universities. The links to this cluster showed that on a long-term strategy, entrepreneurial ecosystems will contribute to advanced entrepreneurial learning and business development especially in emergent economies. © 2021 Proceedings of the 17th European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2021.

The TT field has attracted considerable scholarly attention in recent years and has grown rapidly, resulting in a large body of knowledge. Using a bibliometric approach, this study reviews related research issues as well as their influence and connections and provides directions for future research. It uses Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science database that includes 3218 bibliographic references. Several bibliometric analysis techniques and a subsequent review of the content of the most relevant documents are adopted. The performance analysis provided an updated overview of the evolution of the TT literature from 1969 to 2018 and quantitatively identified the most active and influential journals, articles, authors, and organizations. The co-authorship network analysis allowed us to identify and visualize the structure of relations between authors as well as determine the collaboration patterns among them. On the basis of the information supplied by the co-authorship network, the main literature was reviewed to identify the current status and research trends related to TT, identifying five main research streams and related topics.

This is the case in China, where the mainstream international narrative surrounding social work development has been configured by the normative values and knowledge of a Euromodern origin. Such misrepresentation rarely reflects indigenous voices from the local social work academy. Informed by Foucault’s thesis of power/knowledge, this article first compares the model of state social work in China and the world. Then, as a decolonizing project, a narrative review of 26 Chinese language articles was conducted. Findings: Distinctive service and policy practices in the Chinese traditional helping system were identified to illustrate how western social work was ethnocentrically repositioned in the “post-socialist” China. These initiatives include micro-level “Civil Affairs” services, meso-level “mass work” practice, and macro-level “Minsheng” State and crossregional Pairing Aid Programs, which are rooted in the cultural (Confucianism), economical (socialist market economy), and political (Marxism) ecosystem in China. Applications: Through an indigenized epistemological stance, a state-led anti-colonial framework is presented to unveil the making of social work indigenization and social welfare development that de-centers Eurocentric hegemony. To reorient social work knowledge apart from persistent neo-colonialism in the form of academic imperialism, social work development should be tailored into a locally responsive and geopolitically appropriate models in the non-western world. © The Author(s) 2021.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","188-210","","1","22","","J.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an abductive theorizing process, combining a literature review with an empirical exploration of three different market-shaping contexts. Findings: The study identifies 20 granular mechanisms of institutional work that market-shaping public actors employ. These mechanisms are all potentially employable in creating, maintaining or disrupting markets. Institutional work vis-à-vis individual institutions may differ in direction from the institutional work vis-à-vis the market system. Public actors are not a homogeneous group but may have different values and support competing institutional logics even when operating in the same market. Research limitations/implications: The empirical data were limited to three cases in three small open economies. Data collected from other markets and with other methods would provide more rigorous insight into market-shaping public actors. Practical implications: The findings revealed institutional work mechanisms that public actors can use to shape markets. Companies wanting to engage public actors in market shaping should be aware of the values and institutional logics that influence market-shaping public actors. Originality/value: The paper unites and expands on the scattered knowledge regarding institutional work in market shaping. It illuminates and dissects the role of public actors in market shaping, challenging the reactive stance that is often assigned to them. The study provides a better understanding of how conflicting market views affect markets. It also brings insights into the interplay between market-shaping actions and the multiple levels of market systems. © 2020, Valtteri Kaartemo, Suvi Nenonen and Charlotta Windahl.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","401-435","","4-5","30","","Journal of Service Theory and Practice","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","Institutional entrepreneurship; Institutional work; Marketing; Institutional field; Market shaping; Public actors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes activities such as collaborative research with industry, contract research, consulting and informal ties. We consolidate what is known about the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents of academic engagement, and its consequences for research, commercialisation, and society at large. Our results suggest that individual characteristics associated with academic engagement include being scientifically productive, senior, male, locally trained, and commercially experienced. Academic engagement is also socially conditioned by peer effects and disciplinary characteristics. In terms of consequences, academic engagement is positively associated with academics’ subsequent scientific productivity. We propose new areas of investigation where evidence remains inconclusive, including individual life cycle effects, the role of organisational contexts and incentives, cross-national comparisons, and the impact of academic engagement on the quality of subsequent research as well as the educational, commercial and society-wide impact. © 2020 The Authors","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","","","1","50","","Res Policy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","Technology transfer; Academic entrepreneurship; Life cycle; Academic consulting; Collaborative research; Commercialisation; University-industry relations; Engineering; Systematic Review; Contract research; Academic scientists; Cross-national; Individual characteristics; Research policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, since labels for academic performance, such as test scores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly, leading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine learning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired by the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing community, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative Pre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two models, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on academic performance prediction. In DPA’s pre-training phase, a sequence of interactions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is trained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an interaction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator’s outputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the sequence. We conduct extensive experimental studies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application and show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more robust to increased label-scarcity. © EDM 2021.All rights reserved.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","287-294","","","","","","","","","","","International Educational Data Mining Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

The role of tacit knowledge and its ability to transfer from instructor or professional to the student becomes important because this typically is the “secret sauce” that allows crafts persons to develop and achieve their potential. This study compares the relationship between the Film Industry and associated academic institutions seeking to educate for that industry in two different geographical locations, Norway and the United States, each offering a different industrial presence and employing correspondingly different pedagogical methodologies. The film industry has been chosen as the target discipline for this study because it relies heavily on a wide variety of tacit knowledge, held and implemented by its workers to achieve sustainable high-level productivity. The empirical data collected in Norway in 2018, and in the United States in 2019, is based on a structured questionnaire to professors and students from leading universities with film programs, and corresponding professionals from the film industry in each location. Additional qualitative interview data from the United States was collected in Los Angeles and Chicago, also in 2019. Findings indicate broad similarities in the generally perceived views of the state of collaboration, with professors and industry professionals agreeing on most topics in both locations, however, within the student sectors, there exist fairly disparate views regarding the effectiveness of collaboration, the knowledge transfer methodology, and even their own goals and aspirations. © The Authors, 2021.

Literature review: Prior research points to communication gaps among new engineers. Few studies have extensively examined transitions between academic and professional engineering contexts. Work remains for understanding how new engineers transfer communication skills. Research questions: 1. In what ways do new engineers transfer communication practices from school to work? 2. What challenges do new engineers experience in moving from communication as practiced at school to communication as practiced at work? Research methodology: This study presents a thematic analysis of data from weekly reflections and regular semistructured interviews conducted during new engineers' first year of work. Results and conclusions: Despite relying heavily on academic experiences involving both documenting and presenting technical work, new engineers report experiencing communication-related challenges. While further attention to communication activities can be given within engineering curricula, the complexity and situated nature of communication in the workplace cannot be fully replicated in the classroom. As new engineers move between school and work, they experience challenges adapting to a new environment including communication activities embedded within unique sociocultural contexts. While the classroom cannot fully replicate these professional settings and all of their nuances, students can be made more fully aware of the embedded nature of communication activities. Moreover, engineering educators can simulate aspects of the workplace in capstone courses, and companies can provide guidance to help mentor new engineers through the inevitable context gaps.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","105-120","","2","64","","IEEE Trans Prof Commun","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","Engineering education; Students; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; Curricula; Engineering research; Professional aspects; knowledge transfer; Engineers; Capstone design; Communication gaps; Communications activities; engineering communication; Engineering communications; Engineering works; Professional engineerings; Transfer of communications; workplace communication; Workplace communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have focused on university technology transfer (UTT) mechanisms that lead to the commercialisation of intellectual property. We find that off-late, the legitimacy of such mechanisms, owing to high-failure rates of IP-based start-ups, has come into question. Universities are being invited to widen their academic entrepreneurship (AE) practices to include other forms of knowledge transfer. The increased attention on contemporary concepts such as social entrepreneurship calls for broadening UTT performance indicators to include multiple bottom-lines. These bottom-lines should amplify the societal benefits of AE. This new emphasis raises high-level questions about the societal role of universities and UTT. The aim in this paper is to, therefore, reframe the debate on UTT processes by highlighting a revised agenda for further research. This is done by analysing the extant literature on UTT, academic entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial universities and innovation. The analysis includes a critical review of 96 peer-reviewed articles. As a result, a macro perspective is presented which highlights UTT as-a-mechanism for universities’ contribution to collective societal goals. Propositions are outlined for future research; these can be used for developing new understanding on how universities can actively contribute to socio-economic development agendas. © 2021 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-26 14:36:13","","9-22","","1","5","","Int.

To fulfil the study objective, data were collected from the Scopus database. The bibliometric results found, using bibliometrix software, reveal that this topic first appeared in the literature in 1995 and entered a growth stage in 2014. Systematically, studies have focused mostly on European countries and the emphasis in cooperation is on knowledge transfer. In addition, the results show that SMEs form cooperative relationships with universities in search of competitive results. However, the main difficulty with regard to the establishment of such relationships is a lack of knowledge in SMEs about university programmes that can support them and about how to access such programmes. Therefore, it is suggested that universities should establish more effective communication channels in order to reach this type of firm. © The Author(s) 2021.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","37-50","","1","36","","Ind.

The body of literature pertaining to this topic is growing, though the findings remain relatively controversial and fragmented. Existing literature reviews only describe the general phenomenon instead of focusing on precise areas. Therefore, the main objective of this review is to provide a holistic and in-depth exploration of the factors that drive, impede and are critical for the success of ASOs by posing three specific questions: (1) What drives academics to become entrepreneurs? (2) Which barriers must they overcome during the venturing process? (3) Which factors influence the success of ASOs? Following the basic procedure outlined by Tranfield et al. (Br J Manag 14(3):207–222, 2003) for conducting a systematic literature review, this research selected, evaluated, summarised and synthesised 193 relevant articles. The findings indicated that individual factors carried significantly higher explanatory power in relation to the entrepreneurial behaviour of academics. However, the venturing process and the success of ASOs are influenced not only by factors at the micro-level, but also strongly depend on factors at the meso and macro-levels such as relationships with parent organisations and regional contexts. Furthermore, factors that impede the ASO venturing process and factors at the macro-level are still under-researched and deserve further investigation. In addition, this review discusses several potential promising theoretical and practical implications for stakeholders at different levels, which should be helpful to further promote the development of ASOs in the future. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-26 14:44:04","","97-134","","1","70","","Manag.

An important mechanism to implement the university’s third mission is the creation of academic spinoffs that are start-ups based on research produced at universities and other public research institutions. Research on academic spinoffs has thus experienced significant growth, and several literature reviews have sought to map the often-fragmented knowledge in this topic area. Yet, we still lack an overview of the decision making of academic entrepreneurs and relevant stakeholders–an overview that is of paramount importance in the effort of scholars and policy-makers to understand what drives the creation of (more) academic spinoffs that have good chances of surviving and thriving. This paper is based on 60 papers published during the period 2003–2021 and provides a comprehensive overview of all topics covered in the body of literature on the entrepreneurial decision making of academic spinoffs, by identifying the most salient topics, papers, and trends within this literature. Our analysis shows that the literature on the topic clusters around four macro-areas: contextual factors, spinoff development and performance, nascent academic entrepreneurship, and science parks. Our study further compares and contrasts our findings with the highly influential framework for entrepreneurial decision making of Shepherd, Williams, and Patzelt [2015. “Thinking About Entrepreneurial Decision Making: Review and Research Agenda.” Journal of Management 41 (1): 11–46] and proposes future research directions in light of the unique characteristics of academic entrepreneurs and academic spinoffs. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-26 14:42:01","","2022-2038","","10","47","","Stud.

The result has been a proliferation of literature on aspects of UIC implementation processes often accounting for contextual differences. A survey of previous systematic reviews showed a gap in integration of knowledge on UIC implementation processes from a holistic and economic context perspective. This systematic review of the literature seeks to cover that gap by integrating the literature on UIC implementation processes from developed and developing countries contexts. In total 68 publications were reviewed and the data extracted were qualitatively analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Three major themes are distinguished: channels of interaction, UIC mechanisms, and barriers to UIC. The channels of interaction were often presented in categories. The most comprehensive were found to be bi-directional, traditional, commercial and service channels. It was found that commercial channels are ranked by both industry and academia as the least important and the least preferred by collaboration actors. The review discerned three major forms of UIC implementation processes: (1) educational collaboration, (2) academic entrepreneurship and (3) research related collaboration. Mechanisms of implementing these three forms of interaction vary, but continuous interactions are frequently proposed as the best method of knowledge transfer, contrasting with the traditional linear view of UIC processes. Regarding barriers to collaboration, five categories of barriers (misalignment barriers; motivation related barriers; capability related barriers; governance-related barriers and contextual barriers) are identified. The review indicated also that there is still a research coverage gap in developing countries compared to developed countries, and that the educational collaboration form is somehow neglected. It is therefore recommended to use an action research approach to advance research in developing countries and to provide extra attention to educational collaboration mechanisms since this form is among the preferred means of UIC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","","","","258","","J.

For this reason, numerous learning and research factories have been build up during the last decade. The aim of this paper is to present an interdisciplinary concept model for a learning and research factory aiming to increase significantly the digital competences of concerned stakeholders. The proposed model has three dimensions: (i) content, (ii) function and (iii) methodology and is realized through a specific structure (Lab-in-Lab). Based on this concept model, the Smart Production Lab (Smart Lab) has been designed and implemented by the Institute of Industrial Management at FH JOANNEUM University of applied sciences, Austria. Essentially the Smart Lab is about the digital transformation of connecting businesses - horizontally along the entire value chain and vertically with focus on data generation, integration, and usage. The development of use cases in the two maturity levels - state-of-the-art and research - allows the transfer of knowledge of digital transformation processes for companies as well as active learning scenarios for the qualification of future industrial engineers. As an innovative experimental environment, the Smart Lab addresses companies, researchers, students, and - with the integrated fabrication laboratory (FabLab) - the interested public in general. © 2020 The Authors.

In every building, procedures, rules, and actions are attractively shown on the walls, but most of the people living in that building are not aware of these procedures and do not have any experience what to do in these dangerous situations. In order to be able to apply these procedures properly in an emergency situation, community members should be trained with the state-of-the-art equipment and technologies, but to do so, up-front investment and development of such a system are necessary. In this study, augmented reality (AR) technology was applied to realize a game-based evacuation training system that implements gamification practices. The architectural plans of a university were used to model the floors and the relevant environment. Employees are trained to learn how to reach the nearest exit location in the event of a fire or earthquake, and also, the system provides the shortest path for the evacuation. In addition to these features, our training game has educational animations about the fire, chemical attack, and earthquake events. A mobile application was implemented to train employees working in the building and inform them to know how to escape in an emergency situation. The technology acceptance model and the related questionnaire form were applied, and the response of 36 participants was analyzed. It was demonstrated that AR and relevant tools provide a flexible environment to develop evacuation systems in a university, our mobile application enabled participants to be trained in a realistic environment, and trainees were highly satisfied with the system. Educational animations were also another benefit for the trainees. © 2019, The Author(s).","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:19","2025-07-25 13:43:19","","359-368","","3","24","","Virtual Reality","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","","Technology transfer; Investments; Personnel training; Computer software; Animation; ARKit framework; Augmented reality; Augmented reality technology; Chemical attack; Earthquakes; Evacuation training system; Game engine; Game Engine; Mobile computing; Realistic environments; Software; State-of-the-art equipments; Technology acceptance model; Training; Training Systems; Unity3d; Unity3D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In education and vocational training, they can help learners acquire specific pieces of knowledge in a few minutes, through a “microteaching” approach where learners can be involved in active and interactive exercises, quizzes, and games. Thanks to the advancements of multimedia platforms, they can contain a mix of contents, i.e.: lecturer voice, images, videos, or other e-learning applications. This paper explores the state-of-the-art literature on KPs, with a special focus on their actual use as a mechanism to boost effective knowledge transfer and learning processes. The goals are a) to clarify the definition and peculiar characteristics of KPs; b) to classify their main typologies; c) to analyse their implications under a knowledge management perspective, and d) to highlight actual application fields, pros, and possible cons. Methodology: This study is based on a literature review by means of a search in global citation databases and on a snowball effect, with collective participation and sharing among all the authors. The articles found were then selected and carefully analysed. Findings: The advantages of KPs can be related to the division of knowledge into small parts, which also fits today’s needs of learners to “study faster” and acquire the specifically required knowledge. In addition, KPs are made of reusable materials and can be more easily updated than traditional supports. Possible limits are that designing a KP can be difficult, and careful consideration of the actual learning process and the mechanism by which a certain type of knowledge is transferred from a “knower” to a “learner” is required. Research limitations: Research is based on a limited literature review. However, this limitation is going to be overcome in future research. Practical implications: Findings provide useful insights not only for academics and researchers but also for teachers and trainers dealing with all types of education. © 2022 Academic Conferences Limited.

This article aims to explore the scientific literature concerning knowledge transport mechanisms and describe how the topic was organized by previous studies and terminologies applied. A systematic review was conducted in which the content of recent contributions best fitting these intensions was analysed. The characteristics of knowledge, individuals, organizations, and disciplines were found to be the main determinants in the adoption of transfer mechanisms. These were classified in terms of formalization, relational involvement, direction, and time. On the revealed multi-dimensionality of knowledge transfer and complementarity between transfer activities we framed a new taxonomy distinguishing between channels and processes. Future research may deepen these factors, such as the economic aspects driving the adoption of transfer mechanisms informing decisions on the funding of innovation.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Its different historical contexts required close collaboration among architects, archaeologists, Ministry of Heritage and Culture staff, local workers and students from Sultan Qaboos University (SQU). A central aim was to awaken the interest of the community and encourage them to play an active role in the conservation of local heritage sites. This and the technical solutions adopted are also a focus of the paper. Intangible cultural heritage should be considered to be an integral part of the site. A number of activities was undertaken to develop sustainable responses for the management of Omani cultural heritage: historical and ethnographic research into the traditional techniques of mudbrick and mud plaster construction, with visits to surrounding villages to identify Omani residents familiar with the process; information storage, images, and video interviews for a multi-level, potentially replicable approach; creation and implementation of guidelines for the conservation of the mudbrick walls; organization of site visits, awareness-raising activities for local students and interested community members; the training of two female SQU students in stratigraphic excavation and conservation of artifacts; and the use of state-of-the-art surveying and 3D modeling for the evaluation of interventions.

Consequently, universities are mandated to transform into Entrepreneurial Universities as a third mission, driving state of the art knowledge, skills acquisition and entrepreneurial mindset that supports technological development and innovations to match up with the emerging needs of Malaysia's economy. Therefore, this study assesses the influence of entrepreneurial universities on the development of social capital. Questionnaires were used to retrieve data from a sample of 382 students in two Institutions. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The direct relationships between the three measures of entrepreneurial university (Input, Process and Output) indicated a positively significant relationship with social capital. However, the moderating effects of Entrepreneurial Intention were supported. Our paper contributes to the literature by examining the role of Entrepreneurial Universities using the three factors of inputs, processes and outputs on social capital development and concurrently examining the moderating effect of Entrepreneurial Intention. It also provides evidence-based support to develop models for emerging entrepreneurial universities in Malaysia which can help the national goal of reducing unemployment due to skill mismatch among graduates. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:20","2025-07-25 13:43:20","","","","1","20","","Int.

We use theory-based knowledge transfer norms to evaluate eight practices used by audit academics to transfer research knowledge to policymakers. The discontinued PCAOB-AAA Auditing Section “Research Synthesis Project” came closest to enacting these theory-based knowledge transfer norms. Hence, we examine why those involved in that project did not follow these norms. Interviews with project authors reveal that their review creation approach anchored on the traditional academic literature review, and insufficiently adjusted it to meet the goal of communicating audit research evidence to policymakers. However, interviews with PCAOB project liaisons indicate that policymakers were engaged with and found value in the review creation process. Thus, we analyze PCAOB rulemaking documents for evidence that policymakers valued and used the project's reviews in their policymaking. Over the project's duration, we find increasing citations of research to the reviews themselves and to a broader set of academic research. Our findings of knowledge transfer occurrence in this project warrant further research on the efficacy of mobilizing audit research via research syntheses. We also show how several current audit domain knowledge transfer practices can be combined with the research syntheses approach leading to systematic effective knowledge transfer to policymakers. © 2021 The Authors","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:20","2025-07-25 13:43:20","","","","","94","","Account.

The quantitative bibliometric analysis along with the enquiry with authors show that national collaboration, mainly with academic authors of same or other institution, still is a preferred. Despite international collaboration leading to more average citations, there is no significant gain seen. Scholars collaborate for many reasons, but mostly to gain popularity among peers or to receive citation benefits. Collaboration with private or government organizations, although uncommon, is primarily used to test newly developed ideas or to provide consultancy. Most of the respondents believe that funding is important for research collaborations and low commitment of team members to the shared goal is a major barrier in collaboration.

It proposes a conceptual framework for integrating the multiple stakeholder perspectives for an “education led” and student-focused Entrepreneurial University, something yet to be identified from existing research and, consequentially, future research. Design/methodology/approach: A reflective literature review explores the depth and breadth of EEE provision in Universities, noting: what is taking place, who is involved, where EEE is situated (within the university context), and how the knowledge base is informed. From these reflections, a conceptual framework is proposed as a means of exploring and categorizing progress towards a student-focused Entrepreneurial University through education experiences. Findings: The literature review is largely informed by case studies developed by educators reflecting on student learner experiences for the purpose of course enhancement. These case exemplars provide the resource for emergent, bottom-up strategy that could support the Entrepreneurial University. However, the role of the University is less researched, in terms of providing context and external strategic relationships to resource EEE and deliver a more planned approach to the Entrepreneurial University. The Entrepreneurial University and EEE are mainstream agendas and the development of both must consider the role and contribution of the University in terms of strategy formulation and implementation. Originality/value: This study takes a holistic view, seeing EEE and the Entrepreneurial University as connected agendas. The student-focused Entrepreneurial University cannot result from emergent, bottom-up strategy alone and thus there is a need to address the role of top-down resource-based University strategy in creating real progress. The paper provides a conceptualization, for the purpose of analysing and informing the relationship between EEE and the Entrepreneurial University that places the University as a key stakeholder, and in doing so asks that scholars and educators build the knowledge base not only from cases of good practice but also from the review of strategic management within Universities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:20","2025-07-26 14:58:26","","1258-1275","","9","63","","Educ.

At the same time, there is increasing ambiguity regarding how the nature of knowledge transfer affects performance. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on the nature of knowledge transfer and to understand why it remains a hindrance to most organizations, even now. This conceptual paper tries to identify the major debates surrounding the nature of knowledge transfer in an organization. The challenges and opportunities facing research on knowledge transfer are also elaborated. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper is structured to first provide a brief summary of the construct of knowledge transfer and then provide a detailed account of research that highlights the major findings regarding the nature of knowledge transfer and their relation to the current themes. A selective review of the literature was carried out in this paper instead of a meta-analysis. The papers were identified through popular databases. The authors also examined the references of selected papers to provide a comprehensive review of the construct. Findings: The debate about codification of knowledge that has stimulated the academic community in organizational studies is still in its infancy. The other debates that have been discussed in this paper have either reached their peak or have given way to newer debates. A clear understanding of the significance of the nature of knowledge transfer is very important at this juncture. The model developed toward the end of the paper assumes a path in this direction. The authors also discuss how research on knowledge has both deepened and expanded the authors’ understanding of knowledge transfer since March and Simon (1958). Originality/value: The debate in the field of organizational studies around the nature of knowledge transfer has been occurring for some time. However, there has not been any final consensus on the nature of knowledge transfer. While looking at these debates with a critical eye, the authors may appear to be cynical about the prospect of an end to these deliberations.

One hundred and sixty-five journal papers were initially extracted from Scopus and their content was analysed for the paper selection process by two researchers in parallel, plus a third one in case of uncertainty. Finally, fifty-nine papers dealing with digital academic entrepreneurship and published in a variety of academic journals have been analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis. Findings show that literature on Digital Academic Entrepreneurship is really scant and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis provides the emergence of four major research streams: 1) Digital Technologies for Entrepreneurship Education; 2) The “maker space movement” for Academic Entrepreneurship; 3) Digital technologies for discovering entrepreneurial opportunities; 4) Creating entrepreneurial competences in the Digital “University-based” Entrepreneurial ecosystems. The paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive structured literature review of the disruptive role of digital transformation for the Academic Entrepreneurship. Despite the growing literature on Digital Entrepreneurship, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized. More systematic and holistic studies, considering both the technological, economic and the social aspects of Academic Entrepreneurship are required. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:20","2025-07-26 14:55:34","","","","","157","","Technol.

The lack of indicators of commercial activity, leads us to propose the analysis of a pre-commercial stage of technology that we call entrepreneurial intention. After the literature review, we present a database of academic inventors in patents granted to the university, identifying patenting with an entrepreneurial intention, following Lomas (1993) knowledge transfer taxonomy. Data about publications and received citations by academic inventors is also considered for knowledge diffusion; as well as the supervision of end-of-degree projects in undergraduate and graduate studies; before and after the patent was granted, for knowledge dissemination. Using a binomial model, we estimated two data sets, one for the period 1984-2000 and the second for 2001-2020. Our findings reveal, an average increase of 60% in the number of patents obtained. We also found that the characteristics of the research group are significant in both models, but in the 2001-2020 period it is more important to integrate foreign inventors than patenting with firms, the dissemination of knowledge is more significant and has greater importance in the model. To respond to what extent entrepreneurial intention affects the diffusion and dissemination of knowledge, greater attention should be paid to the diffusion of knowledge since in both models the variable that represents publications after patenting is not significant. The explanation about the dissemination of knowledge improves substantially from one period to another. © 2021, Universitat de Barcelona, Facultad de Economia y Empresa.

Research purpose: Innovation model formation is complex, and the useful QH model can develop and improve to be exemplary. Motivation for the study: The rationale of the study is to validate and improve the QH model with additional concepts, fresh perspectives of experts and the investigation of the primary sub-revolutions forging innovation. Research design, approach and method: A conceptual and critical review approach implied narrative data of the model from secondary sources; a convenience sample of five innovation experts for critical reviews was thematically analysed. Main findings: Ultimately, the improved QH model must accommodate the legal, moral and ethical world to merge with the physical, biological and digital worlds; appropriate terminology for QH innovation leadership is needed, and triple technology theory (TTT) should be incorporated with the triple management theory (TMT) dimension of the model; the review conformed the sub-revolutions of innovation with respect to (1) innovation leadership, upscaling agility and innovation essentials, (2) the triple helix (TH) ecosystems sub-revolution and epochal society and (3) the new technological paradigm, technology intensity and TMT. Practical/managerial implications: The already useful QH model is confirmed and may develop to become exemplary with respect to the hypothetical improvements suggested.

With this article we examine the recent contributions in the field of cooperation of higher education (HE) institutions by conducting a structured literature review. A close regard in particular are the interdependences between stakeholders in order to build a basis for future curricula developments. For our conceptualization, we use the quadruple helix model to analyse the educational ecosystems. Therefore in particular the term “educational ecosystem” is taken into account. The results show that evenso that the term is used there is a lack of suitable definitions in this context. So based on the analysis of the recent literature, a definition of educational ecosystem was introduced and the quintuple helix model, which was constructed for the conceptualization of the topic, was extended by further important aspects - knowledge transfer and adaptivity.

To address this challenge, Stanford released a fellowship called Biodesign, where need-based healthcare innovation is taught with the approach identify, invent and implement. Since then, different European institutions have adopted the Biodesign innovation approach and organized within the Biomedical Engineering-Innovation, Design, and Entrepreneurship Alliance (BMEidea EU). The generation of successful healthcare innovation isn't only based on participating in an Innovation teaching program. It is much more a matter of having the right innovation ecosystem with an open creative mindset, experts, the respective stakeholders, and access to essential resources within reach (close to clinic). Through a qualitative survey, seven Biodesign based teaching programs in the EU were examined. The study from an academic perspective contains information covering Resources, Activities, Academic Performance, and Transfer Performance. The demand for new healthcare innovations, and especially innovation training programs that address challenges, developed collaboratively with the respective stakeholders, is increasing. Additionally, there is a growing expectation that innovation needs to reach the market quickly and be implemented accordingly. A Healthcare Innovation Ecosystem, where different entities function as a productive unit with a shared vision and committed to application-driven research and technology transfer, will increase innovation's success and adaptation.  © 2021 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:20","2025-07-25 13:43:20","","231-234","","","7","","","","","","","","Walter de Gruyter GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 2 Journal Abbreviation: Curr.

Although recognized as a key role in the innovation process, lots of technologies remain unexploited. University spin-offs (USOs) have the potential to transfer technologies into technological innovations. Often though, in universities there is a lack of consideration of potential implementation right from the start. The so-called fuzzyfront end (FFE) stage is crucial for successful innovation, as no commercialization can be achieved without the identification of a suitable application. This represents a critical hurdle, as of to date appropriate approaches for a successful systematic identification and validation of technology applications are missing. Furthermore, most investigating studies rely on data from spin-offs that are already operating successfully on the market and have therefore survived the critical initial stages of development, without highlighting the FFE of their process. This fact makes the pre-development activity of opportunity recognition appear to be a scientifically neglected topic. In this research a mixed-method approach is conducted to investigate the critical hurdles in the technology application selection (TAS) process of technologies, consisting of an extended literature review, completed by interviews with stakeholder involved in the USOs ecosystem. Striving to uncover the black box of the FFE, the study aims to specify and operationalize requirements for application identification of technologies. These findings are of relevance for researchers and practitioners which like to facilitate the exploration of potential technological innovation. © 2022, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

This paper aims to answer the question of how geographically proximate university and industry influence cognitive, social, organizational, institutional and cultural proximity within university-industry joint laboratories and finally, what is the outcome of these interplays on collaborative innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an exploratory multiple-case study approach. The results are derived from 53 in-depth, semistructured interviews with laboratory directors and representatives from both the company and the university within 8 joint laboratories of Telecom Italia (TIM). The data collection was carried out in 2014 and 2015. The analysis follows a multi-grounded theory approach and relies on a mix of deductive and inductive reasoning with the final goal of theoretical elaboration. Findings: This study finds the role of social and cultural proximity at the individual level as a result of geographical proximity as an enabler of collaborative innovation by triggering mutual learning, trust formation and frequent interactions. Cognitive proximity at the interface level could systematically influence collaborative innovation, while organizational and institutional proximity has marginal roles in facilitating collaborative innovation. The qualitative analysis offers a conceptual framework for proximity dimensions and collaborative innovation within university-industry joint laboratories. Practical implications: The framework not only advances state-of-the-art university-industry collaboration and proximity dimension but also offers guidance for managers in designing collaborative innovation settings between university and industry. Originality/value: With this study, the paper advances the understanding beyond solely the relationship between proximity and collaboration and shed light on the interplay between geographical proximity and other proximity dimensions in this context, which has received limited scholarly attention. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2025-07-25 13:43:20","2025-07-25 13:43:20","","433-456","","4","12","","Int.

The lack of conclusiveness results in theory and evaluation literature motivates this meta-regression analysis (MRA), built on fifty-one micro-level studies published since 1995. After controlling for publication selection bias, sample, and study heterogeneities, our results show a small effect on firms' performance.

This is a challenge for human capital to develop continuously in this dynamic era; one of the solutions is digital entrepreneurship. Digital entrepreneurship focuses on creating new ventures and transforming existing businesses by developing novel digital technologies or novel usage. Further, digital technology has also enabled the growth of the sharing economy, linking owners and users, and disrupting the previous dualism of businesses and customers. This paper provides a novel contribution regarding the emerging concept of Digital Entrepreneurship. Based on a qualitative literature review and interview with university staff, lecturers, and students in four large public and private universities in West Java and DIY Province, an interpretative framework for Digital Entrepreneurship has been proposed, which comprises of the following components: motivation (the rationale for the adoption of digital technology for academic entrepreneurship), stakeholders (the stakeholders involved through digital technology to achieve the academic entrepreneurship goal), process (the processes of academic entrepreneurship supported by digital technologies), and business form (the emerging forms of digital academic entrepreneurship). This research also shows several alternative government policies to improve digital entrepreneurship in the academic environment. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","2021","2025-07-25 13:43:20","2025-07-25 13:43:20","","351-359","","3","8","","J.

Many contextual, environmental, social, personal and psychological factors have been studied in entrepreneurship research to understand antecedents of opportunity recognition. To date although studies on digitalization in academic entrepreneurship as antecedents of opportunity recognition are a new growing stream of research many of these studies are still undertheorized or need a robust theoretical background. The paper provides a literature review on digital learning tools and technologies in entrepreneurship education research and contributes to academic entrepreneurship literature through incorporating theoretical framework suggestions. Scopus is used to extract research studies by entering the key work digitalization, digital infrastructure and academic entrepreneurship to identify innovative digital technologies used in entrepreneurship education. The study aims to understand theoretically how such digital technologies cultivate intellectual capital and entrepreneurial mindset in facilitating opportunities in academia. Building upon a multidisciplinary theoretical approach the paper intends to provide a conceptual theoretical framework on how innovative digital learning methods provide an effective learning platform in cultivating entrepreneurial mindset. Grounded on various cognitive theories, entrepreneurship theory and economy theory the paper aims to theoretically address how digital platforms and digital infrastructures contribute to opportunity recognition in academic entrepreneurship.

Guided by Kolb’s (2014) experiential learning model (Kolb, 2014), the research aims to understand how experiential learning shapes leadership and the “self” within the EC, unraveling the nuanced relationship between leadership, personal mastery, governance, and regulatory compliance. The methodology integrates experiential insights, literature reviews, and systems analysis. Key findings highlight the implicit integration of governance and regulatory concepts, ensuring ethical standards adherence. Senge’s (2006) fifth discipline model emphasizes the pivotal role of a learning culture, while concepts of governance structure learning processes and ensure compliance. Personal mastery aligns with governance, emphasizing leaders’ responsibility for ethical standards and continuous self-improvement. Short’s (1998) insights on learning in relationships and Kaner’s (2014) facilitation guide contribute to the governance of participatory decision-making processes within the EC. The methodology contributes to a conceptual framework exploring the reciprocal influence between leadership and the “self”. The study concludes by offering actionable strategies for EC leaders, emphasizing adaptability, collaboration, and a profound understanding of leadership dynamics, governance, and regulatory concepts. Its relevance lies in guiding EC leaders toward sustained growth in the ever-evolving entrepreneurship ecosystem. © 2024 The Author.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:21","2025-07-25 13:43:21","","382-394","","2 Special Issue","13","","J.

Thus, the industry uses academic research as an important source for gaining new knowledge and technologies. However, a successful exchange is fraught with barriers, so it is important to understand the success factors and barriers. This paper presents a model explaining the most relevant success factors and barriers to industry-academia collaborations and their relations. Based on a systematic literature review, an interview study, an online survey, and focus groups, we identified 22 relevant success factors and 22 barriers. We clustered these success factors and barriers into five categories: communication & feedback, information & (technical) support, motivation & commitment, people & team, and structure & organization. We believe that our model will help improve industry-academia collaboration's success by raising awareness of the barriers and offering success factors as setting levers. Furthermore, our model can serve as the basis for further research of methods for and to support industry-academia collaboration. Therefore, we intend to develop a methodology for challenge-driven industry-academia collaboration. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Students who transfer from community colleges, especially those who are underrepresented, often face problems, such as deciding whether or not to transfer, getting academic and non-academic support during the transfer, and finding a job. Also, program advisors at both 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities face problems because they need to know how their students make transfer decisions and how to help them be successful post-transfer. A data-driven and survey-based study will help establish a solid understanding of the underlying elements contributing to these challenges. In this paper, the researchers first conduct a literature review to identify the critical personal and academic factors that influence the transfer decision, particularly for students from traditionally disadvantaged groups. Secondly, an exploratory analysis of these factors was performed by inviting a small group of computing major students from both community colleges and universities to participate in a survey that includes a wide range of questions, from demographics and pre-transfer decisions to post-transfer performance. The preliminary findings indicated that financial challenges, university reputation, university location, job prospects, and family expectations are the primary factors influencing student transfer decisions. The findings of the study can be beneficial to underrepresented transfer students, their advisors, and other stakeholders in higher education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:21","2025-07-25 13:43:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ASEE Annu.

This research aims to construct Innovative Marketing Strategies (IMS) for international student recruitment and contribute to the sustainable internationalization of higher education (IoHE). A literature review was used to construct an Innovative Marketing Strategies questionnaire. Data collected from 300 international students studying in Taiwan were used for a feasibility analysis in order to construct the final questionnaire, and survey data collected from 522 participants were used for more in-depth statistical analysis of the final strategies. The research results indicate that combining the marketing mix 4C with an innovative strategy (IS) approach provides sustainable recruitment marketing strategies toward higher education institution internationalization from a customer-oriented perspective. The IMS in this study includes 2 dimensions, 10 strategies, and 32 indicators. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis demonstrating the perspectives of international students with respect to the strategies was also conducted.

The query strings generated 85 articles, of which 51 were selected for final review. The analysis was performed using MySLR software that uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method, and the effectiveness was measured through the perplexity score and coherence value of the topics. The results reveal that although a plethora of literature is available on these two topics individually, the mutual relationship between these two concepts is understudied. A stronger research interest was observed after 2018 which indicates the infancy of the topic as a whole, which is yet to be explored and empirically tested, specifically in developing economies. Most of the research was focused on the role of universities, innovation, geographic dynamics and policies with respect to entrepreneurial ecosystems. Results reveal the disparity of knowledge spillovers with regard to other contributors; significantly lesser attention was paid to its role in relation to the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Each selected procedure has multiple targets. The first target is to obtain the required dimensional criteria and second, to achieve the ideal mechanical response toward the application. This is currently accomplished through years of knowhow combined with an academic background of materials science and engineering. Since metals are polycrystalline materials, the several rotations of the crystals, the preferred orientation also known as texture, and their interactions, are crucial characteristics that are directly correlated to the final response of the material, and one could apprehend its thermomechanical prehistory as well as predict is behavior. Different atomic arrangements act differently texture-wise therefore in the current review article, the evolution of the microstructure and the crystallographic texture through the thermomechanically rolling process especially of Al alloys for packaging applications is analyzed. The crystallographic texture evolution in 3xxx Al alloys in different processing routes is presented and compared to the anisotropic effects occurring during deep drawing. The earing phenomena in Al alloys are correlated to the produced texture and therefore their understanding is crucial in order to highlight the importance of texture control throughout the thermomechanical process. © 2022 International Union of Crystallography.

In Brazil, universities stand out as the main patent depositors, being important actors in the country's technological development process. The objective of this study is to present the profile of researchers from Brazilian universities and the motivational factors that lead them to patent the results of their research. Based on a literature review, 27 factors were identified, which were classified according to the nature of motivation and expected results. Data from curricula vitae were collected to verify the researchers' academic and sociodemographic profile. A survey was conducted to measure the importance attributed to different motivational factors. The results show that, in addition to the royalties established in Brazilian legislation, universities need to provide other conditions and incentives to engage more researchers in patenting and licensing activities.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance ranking of factors influencing UIC and UIC models in the context of Vietnam. To begin, a systematic literature review (SLR) of previous academic studies on the subject of university-industry collaboration was conducted in order to identify the influential factors in UIC. The order ranking of factors and their relevance weights are then determined using the fuzzy AHP approach. The fuzzy TOPSIS is then used to evaluate three models for UIC, including collaboration in scientific research, technology transfer, and training. The results show that the number of scientists and experts and the awareness of the benefits of cooperation are the most important factors in implementing UIC; meanwhile, the experience of cooperation and training activities and student recruitment activities are evaluated less important than others. In addition, in the context of Vietnam, among UIC models, the technology transfer collaboration should be prioritized.

It is shown that the output of the international activity of these companies depends on their capacity to develop and sustain relationships with each of the different actors involved. Along this line, university spin-offs obtain diverse and strategically valuable external information and resources, significantly reducing business failure chances. The elements that influence the internationalisation process of the companies under study are relationships with customers, allies/collaborators, suppliers, and the company’s reputation and image. Similarly, those referring to relations with competitors, public bodies, and organisations have less impact. Nevertheless, it is evident that companies need to commit more time and resources to create, maintain, and develop relationships with different actors. Therefore, a strategic tool focused on international management is provided, based on the relationships of the spin-offs studied, which may constitute a starting point for its applicability to other industrial sectors and geographical areas. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:21","2025-07-25 13:43:21","","","","5","15","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","","","","literature review; business; strategic approach; statistical analysis; globalization; intellectual capital; internationalisation; networking; relational capital; university spin-off","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, exactly how to measure SP is a matter of some confusion in the academic literature. Indeed, to date, no review has offered a systematic overview of the variety of SP measures deployed in the IB literature. Based on a bibliometric study of 193 quantitative research articles published in top-tier journals from 1982 to 2022, this review provides a science mapping overview of SP measurements. By use of bibliographic coupling analyses, the review finds high variability of measurements within thematic clusters of research, for example within studies of knowledge transfer. This variation hampers the ability to both build and test IB theory. Furthermore, it is highly problematic in view of recent debates about replication within the social sciences.

Tunisia's alignment with the European Bologna Process reforms in 2008 was meant to ease graduates’ transition to the job market through enhancing their employability skills as well as injecting them with an entrepreneurial proclivity to mainstream self-employment as a worthy career path. Several measures were introduced across public universities, including a transversal entrepreneurship module and a corresponding entrepreneurship support structure of technology transfer office and incubators. North's new institutional lens will be used to frame the discussion analytically. The article goes beyond such formal interventions and particularly looks into the informal aspects of the newly-assumed entrepreneurial identity of Tunisian higher education. Following a scoping review approach informed by PRISMA-ScR guidelines, it investigates some informal matters on the shop floor to ascertain the extent to which the new identity has been established more than a decade after the introduction of the reforms. It looks into the profile of the purpose-hired teaching staff entrusted with delivering the cross-curricular entrepreneurship module; students’ and academics’ networks and rapport with the staff of the recently-established support structure; as well as their openness to the Tunisian entrepreneurial ecosystem. Empirical findings from the scoping review suggest a misalignment between progressive formal measures on the one hand and, on the other, a persistently unconducive university environment structured along deep-seated collegial values and quite decoupled from the realities of its national ecosystem. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:21","2025-07-25 13:43:21","","","","","97","","Int.

The importance of academic entrepreneurship at the university level is directed to change the traditional view to a new view that sees Higher Education as an educational institution but is able to generate financial resources to cover operational costs. The purpose of this study is to analyze the extent to which academic research on entrepreneurship has been carried out. The research methodology used is literature review, by identifying entrepreneurship academic journals through the assistance of Scopus and Vosviewer.

Theoretical framework: Knowledge nowadays is considered valuable and can keep increasing along with its use. Therefore, knowledge transfer was believed to be an essential factor in implementing knowledge resources and fostering innovation in organizations. Knowledge transfer is a form of information, expertise, experience, idea, and suggestion exchange, which is thought to have a relationship with the Mapalus culture. Therefore, it is also presumed that mapalus is knowledge transfer in practices. Method/design/approach: Literature review approach to see the deeper links between knowledge transfer and local culture mapalus and interviews with several knowledge management experts and mapalus cultural experts. Results and conclusion: The study found contradictory results relating to mapalus. Several national researchers explain that mapalus culture is still well implemented; some researchers explain mapalus has started to lose its original identity due to the entry of financial transactions. Research implications: contradictory research about mapalus raises doubts that knowledge transfer could be practiced through mapalus cultural activities that may not be able to foster innovation capabilities in society and Mapalus' goal of reducing poverty may not be realized if lost its original identity.

However, due to 99.66% of the continent being covered in ice and snow, geological research and geoscientific study in Antarctica face huge challenges. Geophysical surveys play a crucial role in enhancing comprehension of the fundamental structure of Antarctica. This study used bibliometric analysis to analyze citation data retrieved from the Web of Science for the period from 1982 to 2022 with geophysical research on Antarctica as the topic. According to the analysis results, the amount of Antarctic geophysical research has been steadily growing over the past four decades as related research countries/regions have become increasingly invested in issues pertaining to global warming and sustainability, and international cooperation is in sight. Moreover, based on keyword clustering and an analysis of highly cited papers, six popular research topics have been identified: Antarctic ice sheet instability and sea level change, Southern Ocean and Sea Ice, tectonic activity of the West Antarctic rift system, the paleocontinental rift and reorganization, magmatism and volcanism, and subglacial lakes and subglacial hydrology. This paper provides a detailed overview of these popular research topics and discusses the applications and advantages of the geophysical methods used in each field. Finally, based on keywords regarding abrupt changes, we identify and examine the thematic evolution of the nexus over three consecutive sub-periods (i.e., 1990–1995, 1996–2005, and 2006–2022). The relevance of using geophysics to support numerous and diverse scientific activities in Antarctica becomes very clear after analyzing this set of scientific publications, as is the importance of using multiple geophysical methods (satellite, airborne, surface, and borehole technology) to revolutionize the acquisition of new data in greater detail from inaccessible or hard-to-reach areas. Many of the advances that they have enabled be seen in the Antarctic terrestrial areas (detailed mapping of the geological structures of West and East Antarctica), ice, and snow (tracking glaciers and sea ice, along with the depth and features of ice sheets). These valuable results help identify potential future research opportunities in the field of Antarctic geophysical research and aid academic professionals in keeping up with recent advances. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:21","2025-07-25 13:43:21","","","","16","15","","Remote Sens.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","Technology transfer; Sustainable development; International trade; International cooperation; bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics analysis; Antarctica; Biodiversity; geophysics; Geophysics; Global warming; Ice sheet; ice sheet instability; Ice sheet instability; Lakes; magmatism; Magmatisms; paleocontinent; Paleocontinents; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Remote-sensing; Rift systems; sea ice; Sea ice; Sea level; Sheet instability; Snow; subglacial lakes; Subglacial lakes; West antarctic rift system; West Antarctic rift system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results identified that scientific articles on translational anatomical achievements have an exponential growth rate similar to the growth of patent applications for translational anatomical sciences. The maximum number of contributions of journal articles and patents corresponds to the temporal range of 2010 and 2020, with 2020 being the most productive year; academic documents represented 54.90% and patents produced represented 45.08%, which are significant data if they are compared with the year 2000, when the respective percentages were 76.40% and 23.50%, an indicator of a clear increase in the culture of patentability and the growing interest in translational anatomical research. The records of granted patents were 747 and 487 patent applications, which are significant data for the growth of the culture of patentability as well as the quality of the patents, since those granted represent 60.40%. These results identify the strong growth of anatomical science and its interest in the transfer of scientific achievements. © 2023 Sociedad Anatomica Espanola.

University-industry collaboration is a factor driving innovation and competitiveness. Most research on interactions between universities and industry concentrated on the industrial side meanwhile, universities, as knowledge producers, play a vital role in creating an open innovation ecosystem that encourages realizing innovations that benefit society. Therefore, the problem raised in this research is how university collaboration can support open innovation. This research aims to identify research trends, the latest technologies, and inter-university collaboration frameworks that can support open innovation. The methodology used is Kitchenham's Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and bibliometric. SLR consists of Identification Study, Selection Studies, Quality Assessment, Data Extraction and Study Synthesis. From the SLR stages, 21 papers published between 2019 and 2023 were obtained. Synthesis and additional literature review were carried out to identify trends, technologies, and frameworks related to the topic comprehensively. In terms of trend, based on the application bibliometric, it was found that there was an increase in the number of publications and the top list of open innovation journals. University collaboration in open innovation more frequently takes place in the UK, and the industries mostly involved are small-medium enterprises. Quantitative research methodology and data analyses, comprising of hypothesis test, regression test, and descriptive statistics, are mostly preferred. Meanwhile, descriptive data analysis is the most common means of qualitative data analysis. Numerous suggestions on topics for future research were also identified. In addition, data analysis using machine learning survival data is identified as a novelty among data analysis methods. Technology transfer and the use of digital platforms may support open innovation processes, and the use of blockchain technology may promote digital platforms development. Seven domains form the framework for university collaboration in open innovation, namely Social Behavior, People, Process, Organization, Environment, Technology, and Performance. The findings of trends, technologies, and frameworks in this research may serve as a foundation for research on similar topics, and the identified framework domains could serve as framework components that might be used by universities to collaborate with partners in implementing open innovation processes. The research have contributes to knowledge management theoretically and practically. Theoretically, open innovation can expand the knowledge base by supporting the concept that knowledge and expertise can be found outside organizational boundaries. Practically, it can enrich knowledge management practices by emphasizing the importance of utilizing digital platform technology in supporting knowledge management sourced from external knowledge and collaboration services in the open innovation process. © 2024 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

On the basis of a literature review, an integrative model is proposed to explain the relationship between the studied variables. The results obtained show the mediating role played by perceived behavioural control and subjective norms in the relationship between psychological capital and entrepreneurial intention. Management education must take into account the development of programs that encourage or enhance psychological capital of students, since behaviours, thoughts and actions can be learned and developed in people.

Theoretical and empirical studies emphasize entrepreneurship in every career. Researchers found that successful businessmen had unique skills that helped them achieve their goals faster. Creativity, timing, resource management, and opportunity awareness are connected to career success. This research explores academic entrepreneurs’ best practices. Entrepreneurship is varied; therefore, the study found comparable effects and distinct conflict causes. Comparing general commercial success determinants to the skills musicians need to succeed in Canada and abroad generated four surprising findings: 1. Musicians require entrepreneurial skills. Musicians need skills to succeed and make money. 2. To capitalize on music industry digitalization, Canadian artists must strengthen their business skills. 3. Canadian artists need digital distribution and copyright skills to succeed in the internet era. 4. Entrepreneurship may be taught. Empirical research shows that entrepreneurs can learn better via experience than didactic training. These findings should support earlier research and assist policymakers develop “industry-specific” entrepreneurship tools for Canadian music practitioners. © 2022, University of Arkansas Press.

This study seeks to present an overview of the evolution of entrepreneurial HEI research and provide a description of the structures characterizing it. This paper presents an in-depth examination and analysis of the current state of research and published literature related to entrepreneurial HEIs. A descriptive bibliometric analysis coupled with content analysis is presented, incorporating citations included in Scopus' multi-disciplinary database over the last 25 years. Two software packages—VOS viewer and Bibliometrix R were employed to probe the research questions and create visualizations of the bibliometric networks. Thematic mapping of the multifaceted research field is illustrated and emerging trends of are identified. Findings suggest that the research on entrepreneurial HEI has been pioneered by USA followed by UK and other European countries. Moreover, the research seems to be fragmented and more focused on only entrepreneurial universities. Future research needs to consider colleges and smaller institutions alongside larger universities. Also, further steps need to be undertaken to encourage and enable cross-border international collaboration, so as to draw learning together from different national and regional contexts. © 2022 The Authors.

The methodological procedures were carried out in four distinct phases. The first phase consisted of a literature search regarding technology transfer conceptual models; this bibliographic review was performed using the ISI (Web of Science) platform, grounded on articles published over a period of 27 years from 1995 to 2022. The second search phase was based on the value chain. The third phase had as its objective to apply a questionnaire with open questions to several Brazilian universities. The last phase consisted in developing the conceptual model. From the results, it is possible to integrate the pre-development and post-transfer technology activities, and the process of green technology transfer can be carried out by focusing on the commercial results of technology licensing, including commercial advantages with a sustainable focus.

Therefore, this study aimed to gain a deep understanding of the entrepreneurial university. The study was designed with a mixed-method approach in which quantitative and qualitative methods were used together. In the quantitative part of the mixed-method research, a systematic literature review of the entrepreneurial university concept was done and based on the results of the literature search obtained by quantitative methods, general concepts and categories and their relations with the contexts were revealed. In the qualitative part of the mixed-method research, in order to explain the entrepreneurial university understanding, semi-structured interviews were conducted with academicians in universities. According to the findings, it was found that conceptualization was very important to understand the entrepreneurial university. The university was considered as an institution that serves students and companies via some channels, such as research reports, an academic publication, or a patent received at the end of a project. As the entrepreneurial university paradigm is being studied by various institutions in the world, this study contributes to the literature both as a theoretical study and as a study that reveal the concepts of the entrepreneurial university. By providing a conceptual framework, the research will contribute to the literature as a theoretical study by aiming to explain the service systems (universities, government, firms) based on the exchange of skills and the creation of common value in the knowledge-based society on the entrepreneurial university paradigm, which is extremely popular in the world. Fındings from the systematic literature review and interviews with academicians were analysed comparatively, and a conceptual framework that evaluates the concepts and variables of the entrepreneurial university with a holistic view is presented. © 2022 by the authors.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:21","2025-07-26 14:42:27","","","","16","14","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: MDPI","","","","innovation; literature review; knowledge based system; organization; entrepreneurial university; entrepreneur; conceptual framework; competitive advantages; entrepreneurial university paradigm; global economy; knowledge-based society; theoretical study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work presents a systematic literature review examining 14 innovation determinants to advance the understanding of their impact on countries’ innovation capability. This research studied the literature by qualitative strategies to categorize and contextualize the findings. It also includes the contribution made by experts from a developing country through interviews. The selected publications and the interviews provided fundamental elements to identify the impact and linkages of the innovation determinants on the development of innovation capability.

Focusing on university science and technology research we examine two U.K. case studies of government support from the 'Innovation Knowledge Centre' (IKC) program to translate research into industry innovation for public good. Although IKCs are not tasked to address climate change, the two case studies demonstrate tremendous potential for Cleantech development. An exploratory entrepreneurial finance ('entfin') ecosystem theoretical lens contextualizes the catalytic roles of universities and public funding to support industry at the base of the innovation finance escalator. We thus develop university-industry ecosystems literature, addressing the gap in nurturing university entfin for climate change. Our qualitative case study methodology includes literature review and 51 key informant interviews with: policymakers; university research leaders, technology transfer officers, specialist research to industry innovation 'translation' staff, SME beneficiaries, trade bodies; and early-stage private finance providers. We reveal nuances in different emerging innovation sectors - notably their degree of maturity, locality, and outcome horizons for achieving impact, drawing attention to the key roles of universities and financing and their interactions within their entfin ecosystems.

A debt in sleep duration could lead to sleep deprivation, a major risk factor associated with daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness refers to the inability to maintain an adequate level of alertness during the day which may result in more or less being able to control falling asleep at inappropriate times. This literature review updates on sleepiness regarding its characteristics, etiology and consequences on adolescents. Studies revealed that from 25 % to 78 % of adolescents had reported sleepiness. Its manifestations may include heavy lids, yawns, difficulties to concentrate and emotional irritability. In addition, while it is recommended that adolescents under 18 years-old should sleep from eight to ten hours a night, only 63 % of them actually do so. The etiology of sleep deprivation and sleepiness in this population can be explained by various biological and societal factors. First, the sleep-wake cycle of adolescents shows a biological shift from the beginning of pubertal maturation, described as a perfect storm. It refers to a social jetlag by going to sleep and waking up later and accumulating a sleep debt during weekdays which they try to reimburse during weekends. This phenomenon can be explained by physiological changes such as a slower accumulation of sleep pressure. In addition to this perfect storm, environmental and societal factors contribute to the social jetlag and reduce sleep duration in adolescents. Screen exposure before bedtime can delay sleep and wake onset, which is a risk factor for sleeping debt. Substance use such as caffeine, cigarettes or electronic vaporizer, ADHD or freely available medication, alcohol, cannabis use or drug consumption could further disrupt sleep-wake cycle by stimulating, depressing or otherwise disrupting the central nervous system. Early, before 8:30 am, class start times have been associated with chronic sleep deprivation, higher level of sleepiness and delayed melatonin peak secretion. Adolescents working or doing extracurricular occupations for more than 20 hours a week are more at risk for reduced sleep duration and sleepiness. Parental supervision about sleep during the weekdays were associated with more appropriate bedtime. Adolescents from low socio-demographic characteristics and from minority ethnic groups have reported displaying a shorter sleep duration. Finally, sleep disorders of a physiological origin such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, may explain the sleep deprivation and sleepiness. Sleep deprivation and sleepiness in adolescents have consequences on their health. Cognitive functioning, such as problem solving, attention or memory, as well as school performance, can be compromised by sleep deprivation and sleepiness. At the psychological level, adolescents reporting sleepiness are more prone to display mental health problems: associations were found between sleepiness and subjective perception of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints as well as with antisocial behaviors. Finally, 68 % of 16 year-old adolescents reported they drove a car, and the reported sleepiness could lead to road accidents due to reduced attentional functioning, reaction time and decision-making abilities. In the United-States, from 7 % to 16.5 % of deadly accidents were related to driving while drowsy.

The analysis of the relevant literature on supply-side factors, demand-side factors, and institutional factors reveals the importance of regional determinants in green technology development. Specifically, regional R&D collaborations, university-industry collaborations, and technological relatedness have positive effects on innovation activities in green domains. On the demand side, regional environmental awareness and demonstration effects play a pivotal role in the emergence and diffusion of environmental innovations. Environmental regulations also induce environmental innovation, however, there is only limited evidence at the regional level. Our literature review has informed the development of an agenda for future research, which suggests three avenues for further investigation. Firstly, we recommend abandoning the simple green vs. non-green dichotomy and conducting more technology-sensitive studies on the determinants of environmental innovation. Secondly, we call for a more sophisticated and critical engagement with regional institutions, with a focus on both formal and informal institutions. Lastly, we propose a demand-side turn in research on the regional determinants of environmental innovation in order to better understand their diffusion across space. Overall, our findings suggest that policymakers need to adopt a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to eco-innovation policy, one that considers the spatial and multi-level governance challenges and promotes inclusive regional development. © 2023, The Author(s).","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","291-316","","2","43","","Rev.

Effective management of UICs can mean the difference between success and failure, in terms of technology transfer and research commercialization. This research paper focuses on the micro-level analysis of UICs and in particular the project management practices that can help major UICs deliver benefits and broader societal impact. PM has been evolving toward more hybrid approaches involving both traditional and agile practices. A conceptualization of a hybrid approach is presented based on a literature review. This conceptualization is then used as a starting point for exploratory empirical research. Participant observation, document analysis, and thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted in a large UIC case study to help identify PM practices and check their relevance. Data analysis led to a framework comprising 29 transversal or must-have practices distributed throughout the project lifecycle and 30 contingent or optional practices, divided into traditional, agile and common. This research extends the existing knowledge on UICs by giving a micro-level perspective on managing UIC projects and providing evidence of the adoption of hybrid approaches to assure the overall governance of significant inter-organizational endeavors.

This is the first development phase of the MCPI. This study involved two types of research designs; quantitative and qualitative approaches (Mixed Method). The quantitative data has been obtained from 102 respondents and interview with eight (8) counsellors from different settings. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to select the respondent and proportional stratification was used to determine the sample size of each stratum. A Need Assessment questionnaire has been developed by the researchers as well as the protocol interview. These two instruments were developed based on the literature reviews of previous instruments that have been invented from the Western perspective to measure the performance and competency of counsellors. The results of the study were analysed using descriptive analysis and thematic analysis. Findings have shown that the majority of counsellors possessed knowledge and skills in conducting counselling sessions. Most counsellors in the study demonstrated good interpersonal relationships, interaction, multicultural and religiosity and ethics and professionalism. Through this study, to measure the performance of counsellors, the researchers have found that they must equip themselves with knowledge, skill, interpersonal relationship, interaction, multicultural and religiosity and ethics and professionalism aspects. Based on the interview data, there were new components that have been identified to be added to the Malaysia Counsellor Performance Indicator (M-CPI) which include knowledge (theoretical and knowledge transfer), skills (case management, practical skills and academic/professional writing), interpersonal relationship and interaction, cultural and religiosity, professional roles and expertise, ethics and legality, attitudes and personality, referral and articulate philosophy of the profession. In future, research should also focus on the validity and reliability of the components listed in the M-CPI. © Iran University of Science and Technology 2023.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","","","2","34","","Intl.

Digital transformation must have a relevant role in building the hard skills (HS) necessary for academic entrepreneurship, where HS are easily taught and measured. This study analyses the basis of HS for digital academic entrepreneurship, answering the following research hypothesis: What are the hard skills—entrepreneurial education—for digital academic entrepreneurship and how are they formed? An extensive, inclusive literature review revealed that, due to the possibility of editing, reprogramming and generating digital technology, the basis of DT can support the development of HS in higher education students. The results show that HS can be developed considering three major pillars: (i) Management Tools, (ii) Digital Process, and (iii) Digital Products. Since HS are easily taught, this study shows how the use of digital technology can transform this scalable teaching process in order to reach the maximum number of students. It is therefore suggested that those in charge of HEIs use the pillars presented here in the framework proposed to guide their institutions’ strategic planning. With these pillars in mind, the aim is to stimulate the development of innovative business proposals developed in the academic environment and promote digital academic entrepreneurship. © 2022 by the authors.

By providing the proper knowledge, they can ensure that graduates will be able to adapt to the ever-changing industrial sector. However, to achieve this, the courses provided by academia must cover the current and future industrial needs by considering the trends in scientific research and emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Edge Computing (EC). This work presents the survey results conducted among academics to assess the current state of university courses, regarding the level of knowledge and skills provided to students about the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Edge Computing. The novelty of the work is that (a) the research was carried out in several European countries, (b) the current curricula of universities from different countries were analyzed, and (c) the results present the teachers’ perspective. To conduct the research, the analysis of the relevant literature took place initially to explore the issues of the presented subject, which will increasingly concern the industry in the near future.

These modifications are known as “digital transformation” (DT). In addition, higher education institutions (HEIs) are altering the form of student–lecturer and teaching–learning interaction, where DT restructures the bases of soft skills (SS). Since SS are difficult to measure, this study aims to analyze the bases of SS for digital academic entrepreneurship, responding to the following research question: What are the bases of digital academic entrepreneurship and how are they formed? Design/methodology/approach: An extensive integrative review of the literature revealed that due to the editable, re-combinable, reprogrammable and generating nature of digital technology, the basis of DT, it is necessary to develop SS in higher education students. Findings: The results show that the competencies can be developed considering three major groupings: (1) individual characteristics, (2) cultural characteristics and (3) knowledge sharing. Practical implications: Since SS are not easily taught, this study shows how the use of digital tools can help and support this type of process. It is suggested, therefore, that those in charge of HEIs should use the pillars presented in the framework proposed here to guide their institutions' strategic planning. With these pillars in mind, the aim is to stimulate an entrepreneurial mentality in students and develop digital academic entrepreneurship. Originality/value: An innovative conceptual model of digital academic entrepreneurship is proposed from the perspective of SS, where the interlinking of those groupings is permeated by DT, as well as the disruptive role of digital technology, leading to the development of an entrepreneurial mentality in HEI students. © 2022, Ana Garcez, Mário Franco and Ricardo Silva.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-26 14:40:53","","393-408","","4","20","","Innov.

To answer this question, the authors conducted a two-phase study. First, based on a literature review of the entrepreneurial university and Nelles and Vorley’s theoretical framework on entrepreneurial architecture, they developed a conceptual model and research instrument to assess academics’ perceptions of the characteristics most likely attributed to the entrepreneurial university and their effects on an academic’s entrepreneurial propensity. Second, the authors used the research instrument to conduct a pilot study of the effect of a Canadian university’s entrepreneurial orientation on its academics’ entrepreneurial propensity. The pilot study, using the proposed methodology with detailed accounts of collecting, analyzing and interpreting the data, suggests that the proposed methodology is appropriate for measuring the relationship alluded to in the research question.

The application of these factors and university institutional commitment become essential to overcome the institutional barriers that may exist. Moreover, some authors have warned that in some university systems, transformation becomes a challenge due to high dependence on the State. In this paper, we have examined whether the dependence of Spanish universities on the State can be interpreted as an inhibitor of the transformation process, as well as the institutional commitment of several universities to become entrepreneurial entities, in a national framework that - considering the literature - would not seem the most optimal to achieve it.

Semi-systematic review of 934 peer-reviewed journal articles extracted from the Web of Science database is used as the foundation for this paper. The findings affirm that the current MSWM practices of most developing economies are either ineffective, inefficient, or limited. Hence, they are contributing to environmental, social, and economic negative impacts that can impede sustainable development. Though the literature highlights several remedies that could curtail the negative impacts of current MSWM practices, most developing economies are yet to engage with these due to numerous constraints. Special emphasis is on administrative constraints (or the norms, expectations, and requirements within the specific institutional field where MSWM is practiced in developing economies) that prevents adoption of new MSWM practices in developing economies. In this context, social movements can play a critical role in improving current MSWM practices. This paper makes recommendations for a way forward in which social movements could act as institutional entrepreneurs to change the norms, expectations, and requirements of the institutional field for a sustainable MSWM in developing economies. © 2023 The Authors","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","","","","5","","Clean.

The process involves converting initial conceptual ideas into tangible projects, which are subsequently developed into design patents, culminating in the creation of market-ready products. The study draws inspiration from the exploration of the critical radius of insulation, undertaken during the sixth semester of a mechanical engineering undergraduate program. This concept was practically applied to mitigate heat losses in household pressure cookers. Notably, a gap in the availability of such products in the Indian market was identified through extensive literature review, leading to the student’s engagement in this project. Encouraged by their mentors, the students presented their innovation to the university innovation, incubation, and research center, successfully obtaining financial backing. This paper comprehensively recounts the entirety of the student’s research journey. It commences with the translation of theoretical curriculum knowledge into actionable research ideas. The subsequent phases encompass various research methodologies, including theoretical analysis and simulation studies. The journey progresses with the execution of experimental approaches, effectively translating findings into design patents and, ultimately, tangible market-ready products. Overall, this research emphasizes the crucial role of research experiences in bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application. It underscores the significance of nurturing student’s innovative capabilities within the structured curriculum, contributing to their holistic development as future contributors to academia and industry alike. © 2024, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

However, many challenges exist in identifying the appropriate evidence, disseminating it to different stakeholders, and implementing it in various settings. The Israel Implementation Science and Policy Engagement Centre (IS-PEC) was established at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev to “bridge the gap” between scientific research and policy. As an illustrative case study, IS-PEC is conducting a scoping review on strategies to engage senior citizens in Israel when developing health policy. In May 2022, IS-PEC brought together international experts and Israeli stakeholders to increase knowledge in the field of evidence-informed policy, develop a research agenda, strengthen international collaborations, and create a community for sharing experience, research, and best practices. Panelists presented the importance of communicating clear, accurate bottom-line messages with the media. Also, they highlighted the once-in-a-generation opportunity to promote the uptake of evidence in public health due to the increased public interest in evidence-informed policymaking post-COVID-19 pandemic and the need to build systems and centers to support the systematic use of evidence. Group discussions focused on various aspects of communication, including challenges and strategies when communicating to policymakers, understanding the nuances of communication between scientists, journalists, and the public, and some ethical issues surrounding data visualization and infographics. Panelists participated in a passionate debate regarding whether and how values play a role when conducting, analyzing, and communicating evidence. Takeaway lessons from the workshop included that going forward, Israel must create lasting systems and a sustainable environment for evidence-informed policy. Novel and interdisciplinary academic programs must be developed to train future policymakers in various fields, including public health, public policy, ethics, communication, social marketing, and infographics. Sustainable professional relationships between journalists, scientists, and policymakers must be fostered and strengthened based on mutual respect and a shared commitment to creating, synthesizing, implementing, and communicating high-quality evidence to serve the public and individual wellbeing. © 2023, The Author(s).","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","","","1","12","","Isr.

As the major producer (19%) of GHG, the construction industry needs to optimise its carbon footprint (CF) decision-making processes to provide better management solutions against global warming. Identification and evaluation of the key factors that affect CF decision-making are critical yet limited. Based on our knowledge, no existing study compares the different characteristics of construction projects’ CF management approaches through the whole life cycle phases (including assessment, optimisation, and comparison) to enable CF-related knowledge transfer between the building and infrastructure sectors. To meet these knowledge gaps, this paper reviewed 1,465 studies related to infrastructure and building CF projects and selected 31 studies to evaluate academic researchers’ contributions toward the different CF decision-making stages for the building and infrastructure projects’ whole lifecycle. The paper systematically reviewed and assessed the existing information in five key CF decision-making stages: project drafting stage, methodology choosing stage, data collection stage, CF analysis stage, and CF visualisation stage. A generalised CF decision-making framework is also developed to inform future CF management. The limitations of the existing studies and the benefits of the developed framework were summarised. This study identifies the key information required from the perspective of CF management decision-makers and contributes a universal CF decision-making framework for state-of-the-art CF management practice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","","","","335","","Appl.

Measuring knowledge transfer is crucial in any learning process, but e-learning lacks validated methods for this. Here we examine ways to evaluate that particularly in case of e-learning, conducting a literature review to assess available measurement solutions, developing an evaluation method for knowledge transfer, and validating the method. Using logged data from e-courses, it is possible to assess the knowledge transfer in e-learning. We describe a novel method for classifying effectiveness and efficiency with measured values and measurement instruments. The new measurement method was aligned with a data set of an existing learning management system, and the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer was analysed using quantitative means, including descriptive statistics, regression modelling, and cluster analysis based on a specific e-learning course. This newly elaborated and validated knowledge transfer measurement technique could be a useful tool for anyone wanting to evaluate e-learning courses and can also serve as a baseline for academics to further develop or implement it on larger empirical datasets. © 2023 The Authors","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","","","7","9","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","E-learning effectiveness; E-learning efficiency; Knowledge transfer measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Student entrepreneurship (SE) gained increasing relevance among scholars that suggest more research is needed and identify student entrepreneurship as an emerging and growing phenomenon. In this paper, we present the results of a systematization of the current literature to define the state of the art and identify possible new research directions, analyzing 288 published articles in the main International Entrepreneurship and Management Journals and the main journals in Education and Management Business Accounting subject area. The results are presented in two macro sections. The first one is related to the corpus overview and bibliometrics which explores articles by evolution on time, author, citation analysis, and journals. The second section will involve a content analysis that highlights the main issues that emerge from the analysis of the papers, such as the most frequently used theories, data gathering methodologies and methods and mechanisms adopted by universities to support and promote SE. We are confident that these topic areas will significantly help any researcher approaching the study of SE by offering an overview of the different sub-fields in this area.

Here, this study analyzes the research hotspots and frontiers of this field based on metrics including main research forces, core journals and papers, research hotspots and topics by using the methods of bibliometrics and text mining. The results revealed the following: (1) the number of papers is increasing rapidly in recent years. From 2015 to 2019, 929 papers were published, with an average of 185 papers per year. But the average cited times of those papers is declining, dropped from 6.01 in 2016 to 4.2 in 2019. The USA, UK, and China rank the top three of the number of papers. Univ Maryland, Univ Oxford and Univ Wisconsin have the greatest influence, with an average of more than 77 citations per paper; (2) The most cited journals are PNAS, WETLANDS, ECOLOGY, AND SOCIETY, which are cited 191.54, 53.91, and 40.00 respectively. Most papers were published in OA journals including SUSTAINABILITY, WATER, Forests since 2017. Ten core papers undertaking knowledge transfer in this field have been identified; (3) analysis of the keywords found a new trend of integration of natural science and humanities. In two development stages of 2000–2014 and 2015–2019, the research hotspots mainly focused on mountain water resources, forest resources, land resources and the impact of climate change and human activities, and there are obvious differences and characteristics in different stages.

Its purpose is to analyse the problems associated with the current recovery process of the country and how the ICT-based communication technology can improve the situation. Nevertheless, the aim also extends towards the limitation of the technology and the infrastructures and possible adjustments in this regard. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the aim, the study conducted an extensive literature review of numerous grey literature, policy papers and scientific/academic articles in an exploratory approach. Findings: The result shows that the disaster recovery process of Bangladesh is slow, and there are some mismanagements (the lengthy risk assessment using ancient data generation processes, lack of accessibility and report-based data product) which was a cause behind the massive destruction done by recent cyclones. The ICT-based methods (proper database, many to many communications, GIS) can make this response faster, transparent and easy to access. Research limitations/implications: The research results may lack generalizability due to the research approach of the study. Thus, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: The study includes some possible adjustments to the argument for the existing policy infrastructure and scope of communication technology to bridge the theory and practice. Social implications: The study also includes some suggestions to engage society in disaster recovery processes. Originality/value: This paper urges to study the implication of technology in terms of disaster recovery on a broad scale. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","233-247","","2","13","","Int.

Influential scholars such as Alan Gibb and Paul Hannon early articulated the benefits of tying entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial university literature together. This article positions the entrepreneurial university as an 'emergent pedagogical space' where the typology can find new relevance in educational theories of pedagogy and didactics. Based on an integrative review, the article discerns the disconnect between the two literature streams.

It is, therefore, essential to understand how security-aware these models are and how these models impact software security practices and education. In exercises of a software security course at our university, we ask students to identify and fix vulnerabilities we insert in a web application using state-of-the-art tools. After ChatGPT, especially the GPT-4 version of the model, we want to know how the students can possibly use ChatGPT to complete the exercise tasks. We input the vulnerable code to ChatGPT and measure its accuracy in vulnerability identification and fixing. In addition, we investigated whether ChatGPT can provide a proper source of information to support its outputs. Results show that ChatGPT can identify 20 of the 28 vulnerabilities we inserted in the web application in a white-box setting, reported three false positives, and found four extra vulnerabilities beyond the ones we inserted. ChatGPT makes nine satisfactory penetration testing and fixing recommendations for the ten vulnerabilities we want students to fix and can often point to related sources of information.  © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Ultimately, students gain valuable insight into real-life projects, preparing them for future careers. However, universities in some developing countries lag in their initiatives to promote industry-academia collaboration. In this paper, we explore how to strengthen academic efforts at the University of Namibia (UNAM) with the assistance of industry in Namibia. In the study, we analyse: 1) current practices of industry collaboration worldwide published in ACM and IEEE digital library through a scoping review, and 2) students' capstone projects conducted in the final year of the Bachelor of Science (Honors) in the computing discipline in 2020 - 2022 at UNAM. The analysis from the scoping review found six (6) different University-Industry Collaboration initiatives employed in universities worldwide. Additionally, the review of current students' theses indicates that they are not aligned with all four key industries in Namibia: Mining, Tourism, Fisheries, and Agriculture. Hence, we contextualised the analysis by reflecting upon the economic drivers and demands of the country. The preliminary outcomes of this study allowed us to propose the incorporation of the Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate model in the computing degree programme that UNAM can adopt in developing an effective curriculum that aligns with the demands of the key relevant industries in Namibia. The aim is to support the development of new talent that will promote the country's economic growth. Reflecting on this process can also benefit other universities in developing countries by assisting them in contextualising their curricula and addressing their local and national requirements. © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

While the recent flourishing concepts about new models of universities suggest that the notion of an entrepreneurial university needs to be replaced by a more suitable concept to capture the unprecedented changes in universities in the societal transformation, the features of a new model of university described by these concepts can hardly fit into a consistent framework. This paper responds to this research gap by integrating both conceptual and empirical literature about the transformations or reforms of universities, mainly in the European context. Our major research findings are as follows. First, we identified characteristics of an ideal-type university in innovation ecosystems, named a sustainable entrepreneurial university (SEU), in comparison with those of an entrepreneurial university. Second, we elaborated on three emerging roles of the SEU in innovation ecosystems. Third, we found that while a transition from entrepreneurial universities to SEUs can be seen in European university reforms, the paces of the transformations vary. At the end of the paper, we discuss the scholarly and policy implications of our research findings. © 2021, International Association of Universities.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-25 13:43:22","","20-52","","1","36","","High.

Consequently, cultivating adeptness in early childhood education and childcare talents assumes paramount significance, with educators within tertiary colleges and universities taking a pivotal role therein. Furthermore, research literacy is what educators develop through applying theoretical knowledge and is deemed an indispensable competency in effective instruction. This proficiency is manifested in formulating superlative curricula and augmenting scholastic prospects for students. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to analyze the global academic progression within the domain of early childhood education across Taiwanese tertiary institutions from 2012 to 2022. Employing the content analysis toolkit for academic research technology, the investigation discloses three focal points of research interest: children’s health, preschool curriculum design, and the professional competence of preschool educators. The inquiry discerns that personnel within Taiwan’s higher education sphere have evinced remarkable research scholarly proficiency in early childhood education. This not only bolsters Taiwan’s international scholarly standing but also emboldens nascent researchers to undertake more profound explorations within this academic arena, thereby amplifying Taiwan’s global academic influence in early childhood education. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

As socioeconomic turning points, epidemics imply an entrepreneurial response in which not only managers and entrepreneurs, but also policymakers, health professionals, and civil society as a whole are active participants. Using the PRISMA methodology, we provide a comprehensive review of the complex interactions between entrepreneurship and epidemics over time. Applying a combined Kirznerian-Schumpeterian theoretical framework, we find that, in the short term, epidemics trigger a wave of Kirznerian entrepreneurship aimed at reducing the uncertainty generated directly and indirectly by the medical emergency. In the long term, as medical uncertainty abates, Schumpeterian entrepreneurship can contribute to transforming the post-crisis environment, either supporting or undermining the public reaction to the crisis and determining the path of institutionalization, in the process of defining a new normal. Thus, epidemics could lead to unpredictable socioeconomic and technological improvements, but also to highly undesirable outcomes. The construction of a satisfactory new normal requires the integration of entrepreneurial capabilities within the public sector and an explicit policy of cooperation with the private sector. Therefore, as the short-term phase of the Covid-19 pandemic draws to a close, policymakers must shift their focus away from restrictions and obligations towards a collaborative framework supportive of private entrepreneurial efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:22","2025-07-26 14:53:43","","1653-1684","","4","18","","Int.

In the fashion industry context, the new sociocultural scenario is increasingly driven by pressures from stakeholders to limit the impacts of industrial practices and to move toward new open ecosystems to create and maintain sustainable innovation. This article explores how such innovation can be enabled by design-driven actions in the context of the quadruple helix. Such a model aims to revitalize the areas of technological innovation and gradually advance the construction of the infrastructure needed for sustainable fashion growth, combining and integrating different knowledge. An initial literature review, complemented by case studies analysis, identifies the European fashion industry dynamics of innovation and the roles of industry, government, university, and society. In particular, the government is transforming from a mere controller to a facilitator of innovation synergies. Society relies on citizens revising their consumption habits by shifting toward a performative economy. Industry understands the need for collaboration and adopts new closed-loop supply chains to create and maintain its sustainable development. Universities enable new open system flows to make innovations concerning knowledge, technologies, and systems thrive, from technology transfer to knowledge co-creation. Based on the analysis, we propose a conceptual framework to understand the micro- and macro-dynamics of open innovation with a quadruple helix model to implement sustainability practices in the fashion sector through design-driven actions—reuse, repair, recycle, and refashion—that aim to eliminate the concept of waste to support local ecosystems toward establishing a closed-loop chain. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","","","9","11","","Systems","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","eco-systemic innovation; fashion design for circularity; industry transformation; quadruple helix model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We combined insights from literature review and 15 exploratory interviews of multiple stakeholders, and developed a framework to examine university-industry linkages. We grounded our framework on the social exchange theory (SET) and quadruple helix concept. It proposes university climate readiness (e.g. incentive system), firm climate readiness (e.g. managers' attitude toward academic research), and exchange readiness (e.g. a firm's absorptive capacity) as antecedents to science-business collaboration, coupled with environmental readiness factors (e.g. unique socio-cultural setting in developing economies) as moderating variables. The framework highlights (1) functional value (i.e. technology pricing, quality, and applicability) and (2) relational value (i.e. trust between academia and industry) in the said relationship. The framework further provides a basis for practitioners to arrive at a suitable university-developed technology transfer mode (e.g. patent licensing, research services, and research partnerships).  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","2022","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","","","8","19","","Int.

The results show that the number of annual publications has shown an approximate exponential growth in the past decades. The UK is the most critical node in cross-border cooperation. Alessandro Muscio, with 11 publications, and Henry Etzkowitz, with 793 citations, are the most prolific and cited authors respectively. Research Policy has the highest frequency of citations. The knowledge base of KTUIC includes UIC and knowledge transfer, basic theories of U-I relationships, university TTOs, Bayh-Dole Act and university patenting, and individuals in university technology transfer. Research hotspots mainly focus on the related issues of third mission and entrepreneurial universities. Additionally, we also propose the future research agenda of KTUIC from the perspective of five knowledge bases.

The main objective was to analyse theoretical and empirical studies on the perspectives of different authors in Latin America during the last decade, formulating the following question: What is known about the digital transformation in companies in all sectors in Latin America in the last 10 years? Therefore, a search for scientific articles was carried out in different reliable databases, obtaining a total of 397,477 articles, 87 of which were downloaded and 50 were subsequently selected (18 in Scopus, 10 in Ebsco, 10 in Proquest, 03 in Redalyc, 07 in Scielo and 02 in Dialnet). Thus, after analysing the collected literature, different approaches were found, such as: economics, finance, business, industry, education, communications, digitisation and technology. Its positive impact on companies in all sectors in Latin America is evident, as it provides time optimisation in different processes, and improvements in management and quality. Therefore, it will be essential for companies to continue adapting to the coming changes, given that the Digital Transformation will continue to evolve.  © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

While many previous studies have focused on integrating state-of-the-art findings into business and management classes, little literature discusses how teaching may directly benefit research. The current paper argues that well-designed educational games can facilitate knowledge transfer and function as experiments to boost business disciplinary research. Specifically, the paper presents how the forecast sharing game, a popular game for supply chain management classes, can be employed to study the influencing factors of trust and trustworthiness in a supply chain. Using the game to conduct an experiment with a between-subjects design and analyzing a linear mixed model, the authors show that the game is able to not only disseminate critical concepts to students but simultaneously serve as an experiment for examining behavioral decisions in a supply chain and generate exciting novel research findings. The authors find that retailers' cooperation and suppliers' trust behaviors are influenced by the level of average market demand, a result that enriches the extant literature. The findings are further replicated with participants from a different knowledge background. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","","","2","21","","Int. J.

With the aid of bibliometric analysis, we analysed Google Scholar, Scopus, and the ISI Web of Science databases and arrived at 193 studies that we use as samples; these studies enable us to recognise the research activity conducted on EC from 1979 to 2022. The most influential articles and authors have been identified based on their publications, citations, location, and importance within the network. Apart from this, we investigate current themes, discover barriers to development in literature, and provide ways for future research. Although research activity on EC occurs globally, there is a shortage of studies concerning developing countries’ context; countries experience a lack of collaboration, which is observed explicitly between the authors of developing and developed countries. This research focuses on broadly two themes: entrepreneurship education (EE) as an antecedent of EC, which, in turn, is an antecedent to entrepreneurial intention (EI), and EC as an antecedent factor of firm performance and economic growth. Interestingly, there is also a rising focus on Entrepreneurial Universities. We conclude by suggesting potential research directions. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, there is no systematic survey of existing research to understand the evolution of open government data. Such research can facilitate knowledge transfer within and across domains, and foster learning for countries in the early stages of open government data development. This study quantitively extracted the evolution trajectory of open government data based on the main path analysis method and then analysed the underlying motivations. The results show that open government data research went through four main phases and that the open government data movement has spread towards developing countries and smart cities. Different challenges and issues faced by the researchers in each phase drove the evolution of open government data research. Finally, we discuss future directions of open government data research based on our findings and recent development. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces. Points for practitioners: Open government data efforts have evolved over the years into a global phenomenon. Countries have learned from each other and more and more efforts are focused on innovating with open government data by stimulating co-creation and using other incentives. The way that data are opened should focus on achieving goals like innovation, participation, transparency and accountability.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the influences of two components of intellectual capital, relational and human capital at the international level, and psychological capital on international orientation of academic entrepreneurs, and the mediating effects of international relational and human capital. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a literature review, a theoretical model is proposed to explain the relationship between the studied variables. Our hypotheses are tested on a sample of 173 academic spin-offs of Spanish universities using bootstrapping methodology. Findings: The results show that the international market relational capital and international human capital of academic entrepreneurs influence their international orientation, and that their psychological capital is directly, and indirectly, related to international orientation through international human capital and international market relational capital. Practical implications: This study provides a better understanding of the antecedents of the international orientation of academic entrepreneurs, which would provide an important contribution to the literature on intellectual capital, academic entrepreneurship and internationalization. The achieved results highlight important implications for training of academic entrepreneurs and for managers and management teams of companies willing to enter, or even those already operating in, international markets. Originality/value: In this study, the international orientation of academic entrepreneurs is explained through the psychological capital that is studied jointly with two components of intellectual capital, relational and human capital at the international level. Although some recent work has focused on the study of the internationalization of academic spin-off, this line of research is still incipient. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-26 14:56:38","","683-709","","3","24","","J.

In this sense, the perspective of entrepreneurship gains importance in basic sciences. This study aims analyze documents published on entrepreneurship in basic sciences (physics, chemistry, biology) using a bibliometric review. For this aim, the bibliometric analysis method based on the systematic literature review approach was used. Systematic review was carried out in the WoS database. A total of 428 documents (1994-2020) on entrepreneurship in basic sciences in the WoS were retrieved. The bibliometric analysis results were presented under two main categories as descriptive (numbers of documents according to year, author, country, organization, source, research area, WoS category area) and evaluative results (co-occurrence, co-authorship, citation analysis). Descriptive results were displayed with frequency values, and evaluative results were displayed using VOSviewer visualization software. As a result, it was determined that there is an important increase in the number of documents towards 2020. In addition, it was determined that the most productive, influential, and collaborative author is Jardım-Goncalves R, the most productive country is the USA, the most productive journal is Journal of Technology Transfer, and the most productive organization is Old Dominion University. Moreover, it has been determined that the most influential area in terms of research area is “business economics” and the most keyword co-occurrences are “entrepreneurship”, “design science” and “academic entrepreneurship”. © 2023,Journal of Turkish Science Education.

Poor waste management can lead to pollution, disease outbreaks, greenhouse gas emissions and social conflicts. Therefore, developing countries need to adopt strategic decisions to improve their waste management systems and practices. This article explores waste management in some developed country such as Singapore, Sweden, Germany, and Japan and compare them with Algerian situation. The objective is to assess the gap between the approaches adopted by these countries, in order to identify good practices and opportunities for improvement in Algeria. The document examines the scientific research and academic contribution in the field of waste management, then presents the types of waste. It analyzes the infrastructures, the technologies used, the methods of collection, sorting, recycling, and disposal of waste. Relevant policies, departments and agencies in each country are also reviewed, with an emphasis on laws and regulations specific to waste management. The results of this comparative study highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the waste management system in Algeria compared to other countries. Good practices identified elsewhere are discussed, highlighting opportunities for knowledge transfer and best practices that can be applied in Algeria. Finally, recommendations are made to improve the waste management system in Algeria, taking into account the socioeconomic and environmental realities of the country.  © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","164-169","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Among the reasons for this importance have been declining government financial support for public universities, greater accountability to funding agencies, and increased expectations for commercialization revenues. Combined with recent economic uncertainty, the search for additional revenue sources has accentuated the need to better involve faculty in successful technology commercialization efforts. Thus, university administrators and technology managers face challenges in attracting, engaging, and retaining faculty participation in this effort. This paper reviews the relevant literature to understand how tenure and promotion policies can incentivize or disincentivize faculty members from pursuing technology commercialization projects. Prior research has focused primarily on the determinants of performance and benchmarking issues while faculty career path choices have been neglected. We address this gap in the literature by considering technology commercialization, faculty choice, and institutional policies in tandem. We conducted a systematic review of relevant literature on faculty involvement in technology commercialization and identified incentives and impediments for pursuing technology commercialization. Next we developed research hypotheses drawn from the literature review to assess faculty attitudes and activities, and their career development stage, based on the literature. Data collected through surveys will be used to test the hypotheses. We propose that the choice to participate in technology commercialization is a risk-payoff decision for faculty that depends on their career stage and subject matter area of work. As the faculty member becomes more secure in their position, such as tenured, the perceived risk of participation declines while the perceived reward value of incentives increase. As this perception changes due to career stage progress, we expect that faculty will be more inclined to participate in technology commercialization activities. We discuss how choices involving technology commercialization projects relate to a faculty career path and institutional technology commercialization policies, and how these policies are used to promote faculty participation in technology commercialization projects. © 2024 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

This essay offers a thorough analysis of academic works on XR that show modifications to the way labour is actually organized. We examine XR research's theoretical and methodological foundations as well as its application areas. The PRISMA statement was followed during the evaluation procedure. The primary application domains of XR were design, remote collaboration, and training. By modifying the perception of space, XR made it possible to overcome constraints imposed by time and space, safety, and resources. It is still rather uncommon to do research on XR applications in real-world workplace contexts, and it mostly focuses on three areas: teamwork, knowledge transfer evaluation, and working procedures. The most prevalent application of XR was virtual reality, albeit the hardware used varies depending on the situation. Collaboration, work habits, and knowledge transfer evaluation were the four XR research areas we defined, which roughly mirrored the application domains. Only a few recent studies used unique methods of data collection, such as videotaping participants' movement in virtual reality, in the articles we evaluated. We could not identify any XR-specific procedures in the articles we reviewed. For the time being, XR still has a lot of potential rather than definite general advantages in the workplace. © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

A systematic review of the literature on the intersection: Education and Social Entrepreneurship, with the support of scientific literature and a careful search methodology. It collects articles from the WOS Core collection database published between 2000 and 2022. A total of 367 articles are analyzed to answer the three research questions. The results of the analysis are twelve dimensions identified according to the literature in the field of social entrepreneurship education; after using lexicometric analysis and Iramuteq software, the main trends on the topics are found and discussed and the relationship of terms and concepts in the abstract and title text of the analyzed articles is shown, showing the frequency, importance of linkage, and co-occurrences of lexical units. Six clusters of nodes and related terms are confirmed: entrepreneur, development and innovation, education, entrepreneurial university, context, and types of study.

Probing the stakeholders’ perspectives and applying a systematic approach, this study analyses 227 English-written articles retrieved from the Web of Science database published from 2000 to 2021. Key challenges identified include difficulties in managing the TNE programmes, ensuring quality assurance, adapting the curricula to the local contexts, accommodating offshore students’ learning styles, creating studying environments for TNE students equivalent to those in the home institutions, ensuring preparedness of the academic staff, and facilitating the knowledge transfer in the host countries. The analysis also highlights six factors for the sustainable development of TNE programmes, including the effectiveness of the operations, the internationalization of the curricula, the transnational experience of the students, the development of the transnational staff, the existence of a proper regulatory framework in the host countries, and the development of a global systematic data collection for quality assurance. In addition, the evidence collected suggests that while the transition from domestic into a foreign programme can be rewarding, it demands appropriate planning and implementation. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.","2023","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","113-136","","1","48","","Stud.

Using knowledge synthesis methods such as systematic scoping study methods may facilitate knowledge tool development and guide evidence-based practice to improve knowledge transfer. However, identifying these opportunities poses a challenge as systematic scoping study methods have yet to be applied and adapted to this context. Thus, to extend systematic scoping study methods, the purpose of the current investigation is to describe the adaptation of systematic scoping study methods in the context of cancer-specific “real world” opportunities in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Systematic scoping study methods were adapted to develop a knowledge tool, which was a credible resource website for researchers, clinicians, and survivors. Three search strategies including Advanced Google Search, targeted website search, and consultations with experts were used to identify eligible (e.g., appropriate for cancer survivors, offered in the community) cancer-specific physical activity programs. Only the targeted website search was used to search post-secondary institutions because they are centralized onto one government website. Results: Fifty-eight programs and 10 post-secondary courses met the eligibility criteria. Relevant data from these opportunities were extracted, charted, synthesized, and uploaded onto the resource website. The most successful search strategy for cancer-specific physical activity programs was the targeted website search followed by Google Advanced Search and consultations with content experts. Conclusions: Challenges were experienced due to lack of standard reporting among opportunities, bias of potentially relevant records, and changing nature of resulting records. The current investigation demonstrated that systematic scoping study methods can be applied to cancer-specific physical activity programs and post-secondary courses in the context of cancer survivorship in Ontario yielding robust results. The method can be further adapted and updated in future knowledge syntheses in health-related contexts.

The research focuses on a case study conducted at the largest higher education institution in Armenia. A comprehensive literature review was initially conducted to gain a deep understanding of the motivations and channels within the framework of university-industry partnerships. Data for this study was collected through online questionnaires administered to the YSU Faculty Administrative Staff, including deans and chairs. Additionally, a documentary analysis was employed as a supplementary data collection method. The analysis of the literature resulted in the development of a hierarchical classification with group/subgroup divisions for the collaboration channels, which distinguishes itself from other variations by encompassing all possible channels. Furthermore, a set of criteria was developed to assess the impact, practical applicability, and feasibility of each collaboration channel. Based on the survey results, these criteria were used to characterize each collaboration channel. The study also examined the primary constraints and difficulties associated with university-industry partnerships. The findings of the study offer several suggestions and implications for policy development.

This study delves into AI in education (AIEd) within Africa, analyzing its trends, opportunities, challenges, and prospective paths. Employing the PRISMA framework, we systematically reviewed 22 articles published from 2017 to 2022. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of AIEd in Africa's educational landscape, highlighting the shift towards adaptive testing, particularly computer-adaptive testing (CAT), and its advantages, like precise student assessments and reduced test durations. The study also explores strategies to enhance graduate employability, emphasizing university-industry collaborations, curriculum updates, and quality assurance. Furthermore, it examines the implications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) in education, advocating for integrating emerging technologies and adapting educational content and practices to meet digital-era challenges. While technology integration, including smartphones and ICT tools like Moodle, shows promise for enriching learning experiences, we identify pressing challenges such as resource contextualization, teacher training, and ethical issues. The study concludes with targeted recommendations for educators, policymakers, and African stakeholders to harness AIEd effectively. Emphasizing areas like adaptive testing, robust university-industry partnerships, 4IR-aligned curriculum development, and ethical, inclusive technology integration, these recommendations aim to empower African education systems to capitalize on AIEd's benefits while navigating the complexities of the digital age. © 2025, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

The purpose then is to study the developer´s perspectives on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of technological innovations for rehabilitation in clinical settings. Methods: A qualitative research study was undertaken with biomedical engineers working at university. Two focus groups were conducted with open-ended questions to explore their perceptions of technology development and perceived barriers and facilitators during implementation. The analysis included preliminary coding based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), review and discussion of emerging themes. Results: Eleven technology developers (biomedical engineers, researchers) took part in the study. Among the main barriers identified were the fact that the source of the innovations is the literature state of the art, and the underlying aim of the innovations is to provide an original solution. Also the results showed a lack of consensus regarding the end user of the innovations and the lack of consideration of the characteristics valued by the clinic. Among the facilitators identified, the adaptability of the innovations to the clinical setting stands out. Conclusions: In this group of developers there is a duality between the scientific originality of innovations and the transferable nature of these developments. This acts as a barrier to generating technology that meets user requirements.

Yet, oral diseases are among the most common noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the World Health Organization (WHO) African region. The WHO African Regional Oral Health Strategy and the WHO Global Strategy on Oral Health were endorsed in 2016 and 2022, respectively, to address the current alarming situation by integrating oral diseases as part of NCDs toward universal health coverage (UHC). Both strategies highlighted the importance of research, especially the necessity to create and continuously update context- and needs-specific research; however, there is a paucity of information regarding research supporting evidence-informed oral health policies in the region. In this context, the University of Pennsylvania, African universities led by the University of Nairobi, and the WHO Regional Office for Africa initiated an “Evidence to Policy” project. This project consists of 3 phases: (1) preparation: stakeholder analysis; (2) co-creation: online needs assessment survey with oral health academia in the region and 2 scoping literature reviews to identify oral health research and barriers and facilitators for the development, dissemination, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of oral health policies; and (3) validation: sharing findings from phase 2 through the stakeholder meetings. This executive summary presents the results of phase 3, the stakeholder in-person meeting held in November 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya. About 70 participants, including oral health educators and representatives from the Ministry of Health and WHO in the region, discussed and identified actionable recommendations based on findings from phase 2. Then, participants assessed their alignment with the WHO Global Strategy. At the end of the meeting, participants pledged to maintain the relationships between academia and policy makers and will work collectively toward UHC for oral health for all in the region based on the “Nairobi Declaration.” Knowledge Transfer Statement: This executive summary can be used by all key stakeholders involved in creating, disseminating, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating oral health policies in the African region to leverage research and accelerate the implementation of the WHO Global and African Regional Strategies on Oral Health. © International Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research and American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research 2024.","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-25 13:43:23","","204-208","","3","10","","JDR Clin.

Up to now, no comprehensive study has been done regarding adolescents’ roles and experiences in all stages of disaster management, and discussions existing in the domain of adolescents’ engagement in disaster risk management are usually restricted to children’s participation. Thus, this study aims to extract the effective components and factors in disaster education to improve adolescents’ resilience to disasters. Design/methodology/approach: This systematic review was done through English databases and three Persian databases between August 18, 2001, and August 31, 2021. The articles were searched based on the PRISMA checklist using four key dimensions of “resilience,” “disasters,” “adolescents” and “education.” Finally, the effective components and factors in disaster education for improving adolescents’ resilience during disasters were extracted. Findings: Totally, 29,856 articles were extracted through the systematic review. After studying the titles, abstracts and contents of the extracted articles, 17 were selected for the final analysis. Among these articles, 3, 12 and 2 had qualitative, quantitative and mixed research designs, respectively. The extracted components were categorized into five major categories including education, community, adolescents, resilience and governing policies and approaches. Research limitations/implications: Unfortunately, due to sanctions, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences did not have access to the Embase database, and consequently, this database could not be used. Originality/value: The results of this systematic review presented an overall view of the effective components of adolescents’ disaster resilience education. The formation of thoughts developed feelings, and social knowledge in this age group provides a wide range of opportunities for social empowerment and intergenerational knowledge transfer. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-26 14:45:17","","157-172","","2","16","","Int.

This study proposes a refined digital business model canvas (DBMC) to address digital entrepreneurship’s unique challenges and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a systematic literature review alongside a double-round validation of semi-structured interviews and qualitative research. We interviewed digital entrepreneurs from university spin-offs until we reached data saturation in the first round, contributing to internal validity. Then, the new model was validated in the second round of interviews. Findings: The DBMC successfully bridges gaps identified in the conventional BMC by enhancing strategic focus, clarifying financial planning and improving early adopter identification. Validation interviews confirm that the adapted framework is better aligned to the operational realities of digital ventures, reinforcing its theoretical contribution through a nuanced application of the resource-based view. Research limitations/implications: The study’s qualitative design and sample from a single innovation agency may limit generalizability; further testing in diverse settings is recommended. Practical implications: The DBMC provides a robust, adaptable framework for digital entrepreneurs, offering valuable insights for strategic planning, entrepreneurial education and policy development.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a literature review methodology combined with bibliometric and network analysis based on 117 papers identified from the Scopus database. In particular, this study has tried to identify and capture themes not previously fully captured or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. Findings: The authors have identified research themes and research gaps in the area of RKT. Overall, the review shows the main outlets that have published papers on RKT and the theoretical background this research is built on. This study exhibits core themes in this area that have persisted and grown consistently such as the subsidiary’s role in RKT. In addition, the review highlights less researched themes such as role of boundary spanning in RKT, which open exciting avenues for new research opportunities. Research limitations/implications: This study finds that RKT research has experienced remarkable growth from a complete viewpoint in recent years. There was a surge in publications in the area from 2008 onwards, and many of its influential papers seemed to have been published between 2013 and 2018. Prominent themes in this body of research have been identified and potential for future studies has been explored.

By expanding the traditional five-stage scoping review process to seven stages, the CSRF places a strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement, effectively bridging the divide between researchers and stakeholders. This framework enhances the relevance of scoping reviews for both academic and practical applications, promoting more inclusive research methods, improving knowledge mobilization, and guiding future practice and research.

Global expansions and knowledge transfer in supply chain networks bring efficiency and effectiveness to companies. However, the probability of supply chain complexity has also been seen increasing. The barriers to sustainable supply chain networks need to be tackled in an effective manner as they impact business operations. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate and reduce the supply chain complexities, as it will facilitate the process of knowledge transfer and increase the implementation of sustainable practises in supply chain networks. In the previous research, four supply chain complexity drivers were identified. Previous research identified four supply chain complexity drivers by conducting a systematic review. This study investigates which of the four complexity drivers impacts knowledge transfer in the context of the food supply chain sector. Methods: In this research, knowledge transfer is therefore examined from the perspective of sustainable food supply chains. Thirty exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted in this study and analysed using Nvivo (v12) software. This study utilised thematic analysis techniques for the evaluation of the interviews to gather results. Results: The results illustrated six main factors classified under broad categories: integration of Knowledge Transfer, incorporation of technological advancements in supply chain networks, supply chain complexity solutions, supply chain complexity drivers, sustainable supply chain networks, and capability to reduce supply chain complexity. The findings of this study highlight that process complexity significantly influences the process of knowledge transfer in food supply chain networks. The research findings contribute to both academic and practical domains. This study contributes to the aggregation of supply chain complexity and its impact on Knowledge Transfer. Additionally, the findings support supply chain networks, which strive to achieve efficient Knowledge Transfer to attain sustainable value in business operations. Conclusion: This study has proven that robust knowledge transfer reduces supply chain complexity as it makes supply chain systems more resilient and well-coordinated in many potential ways. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:23","2025-07-26 14:52:43","","","","1","8","","Logist.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/yzPjX?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=HpYFqsmJPXTm93ieLC6OzpiAqr4%3D","Research; Systematic review; Sustainability; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; knowledge transfer; Knowledge; Collaboration; Supply chains; Supply chain management; process complexity; supply chain complexity factors; sustainable supply chain networks; Business And Economics--Management; Food; Food security; Food supply; Supply chain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The debate on how USOs generate innovation outcomes has often focused on tangible assets, while the role of intangible assets has been less explored and remains loosely defined. Yet emerging research suggests that intangible assets, especially in the early stages of a USO's lifecycle, have a critical influence on its survival and future success, highlighting a need for a better understanding of how intangible assets enable science-based innovation through USOs. Drawing from several streams of literature, we define intangible assets in the context of science-based innovation through USOs: an intangible asset is a resource that is non-physical, non-financial, has long life, and has potential to provide future benefits to the owner. Based on this working definition, we conduct a systematic literature review of the leading innovation management journals and inductively derive a framework outlining the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of science-based innovation through USOs, focusing on the influence of intangible assets. The framework identifies the categories of resources which can enhance or hinder science-based innovation through USOs. Such categorization reveals fruitful directions for future research such as a deeper examination of societal outcomes. We conclude by offering recommendations for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers to better leverage intangible assets to enhance science-based innovation. © 2023 The Authors.

For this, the Performance Measurement Systems (PMS) of the universities management are analyzed as a proxy for the implementation of the strategic vision of the universities. This study is based on a systematic literature review on the subject, supported by the technical possibilities offered by the MAXQDA (The Art of Data Analysis) program. The databases used were the following: Elsevier (Science Direct), Springer, Wiley and Taylor & Francis. The main findings suggest that organizational ambidexterity, in general, develops unevenly and from different approaches, among which innovation, learning and strategy stand out. However, organizational ambidexterity hardly develops in a university context, where most of the university activities require some knowledge of the technological frontier. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and understand these two dimensions (exploration and exploitation) and their positive influence on entrepreneurship. In a context where the development of technology and science happens at an ever-increasing speed, a balance between exploration and exploitation is necessary, which should be reflected in the different control mechanisms in academic environments, such as the Performance Measurement Systems (PMS). The analysis of these systems will allow to know the position of the universities in the face of ambidexterity. © The Author(s) 2022.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-26 14:41:00","","345-366","","1","20","","Int.

This makes it essential to identify and select the most suitable processes to maximize the benefits for organizations. However, despite the increasing interest of academics and professionals in RPA, the literature lacks a study on the main criteria organizations should consider to decide which processes to automate. Therefore, this research lists the main criteria for process automation based on scientific and professional know-how. A systematic literature review was performed, followed by a Delphi study with RPA professionals, to tune the former insights collected from the scientific literature. Our findings point to 32 criteria that organizations and decision-makers should consider before choosing which processes to automate. Feasibility, process description, and input and output data are the most voted. The criteria are evaluated with 18 processes in six organizations with positive results.

Most institutes follow thumb rules such as fixed rates based on crop type or fixed percentage of net present value to determine license fees. Hence, there is a paucity of scientific basis to validate the price or actual value of the crop variety developed through research. The research to develop a standardised framework for crop varieties valuation in the public system is also in its initial stage. This study aims to identify suitable techniques for the valuation of crop varieties through a systematic review of the extant literature. We studied the trends in the publications and the major approaches used in the literature. We identified the best-fit technology valuation methodologies for crop varieties by comparing the factors under consideration for valuation. A framework for crop variety valuation was developed by considering its variables and appropriate techniques to be applied. The study is the first of its kind and provides a critical review for developing crop variety valuation protocols by future researchers and university tech transfer offices for better crop variety commercialisation prospects.

This paper presents a systemic review of the academic research on IIs and suggests future research directions. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 556 documents from the Web of Science with Bibliometrix. The results show that IIs have experienced a surge of publications over the past three decades, with the UK and the US leading in productivity and influence. Although research on IIs occurs globally, cross-national collaboration is lacking, especially between authors of developed and developing countries. Our keyword co-occurrence analysis identified three major research clusters represented by innovation performance, knowledge networks, and technology transfer, which are also reflected in different stages of thematic evolution. Furthermore, we conducted a content analysis of the most influential articles across multiple disciplines and different time slices to identify the key discipline interests and provide a comprehensive picture of research themes over the years.

This study presents a Knowledge-Driven Evidence Fusion Segmentation Network (KEFS-Net), a framework that systematically integrates radiological and anatomical knowledge from medical reports with imaging features to enhance segmentation accuracy. KEFS-Net consists of three key components: (1) a knowledge-driven attention network that leverages large language models, discrete information bottleneck, and cross-attention to enhance CT image segmentation performance by capturing informative features from medical reports, (2) an evidence fusion strategy based on Dempster–Shafer theory that optimizes segmentation results by evaluating the consistency between textual knowledge and image predictions, and (3) a masked learning approach that ensures robust performance in clinical scenarios with incomplete tumor descriptions. The framework was evaluated on both the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset and an external clinical dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital (FAH) of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice of 59.10% and 59.42% respectively for tumor segmentation on the MSD and external dataset. The approach shows particular strength in handling diverse tumor characteristics including size variations, boundary ambiguity, and complex anatomical locations. This knowledge-driven framework represents a significant advancement in leveraging domain knowledge through multi-modal integration for improved pancreatic tumor segmentation.

Using affiliation data in publications of German researchers, their cross-sector career transitions from the public research organisation Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and industry to universities are analysed. Although the rate of transitions is small, there are distinctive windows of opportunity at a junior career stage, especially for Fraunhofer researchers. Researchers who publish more and in more acclaimed journals, Fraunhofer researchers who co-publish with universities, and women are more likely to gain a university affiliation over the course of their career. These results indicate the influence of institutional proximity for cross-domain career transitions. The quality and impact of academic knowledge could be improved if the higher education sector was more open to recruitment of researchers from other sectors.

This paper adopts a systematic literature review approach for explorinhe trajectory of the USO research field. It categorizes the literature based on two perspectives: the process of how USOs develop and what factors can explain the variance of USO development; the paper critically examines the USO literature through these two lenses. By integrating these two perspectives and examining 120 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1987 and 2022, we develop a comprehensive model of USO development. The paper contributes to the extant literature on academic entrepreneurship by contending that while the “how” and “what” questions pose unique challenges for USO scholars, they cannot be separated because the process and variance models are complementary and important in advancing research on USOs. As such, we explore and identify specific factors that affect each of the distinct phases of the USO development at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels of analysis which form the basis for a rich future research agenda. © 2023 The Authors","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-26 14:41:29","","","","","130","","Technovation","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","University spin-offs; Systematic literature review; Innovative technology; Integrated framework; Integrated frameworks; Integrating research; Process perspective; Research commercialization; Research commercializations; Research fields; Research outcome; University spinoffs; Variance perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the advantages of integrating the feature information and diagnosis knowledge, the transfer learning technique based on multiple source domains has become a stable and efficient solution to address the fault diagnosis challenge under variable operating conditions in the modern intelligent operation and maintenance. For the above discussions, a multi-source domain information fusion network (MDIFN) is proposed in this paper to obtain generalized knowledge with abundant feature information by combining the adversarial transfer learning technique with fine-grained information fusion of multiple source domains. First, an adversarial transfer network architecture is constructed in accordance with the complex feature transformation and the boundary equilibrium domain discrimination to implement feature learning and knowledge transfer of source and target domains. Then, a joint distribution domain adaptation mechanism is proposed to further facilitate the acquisition of domain invariant features. Finally, a class-related decision fusion (CDF) strategy is designed to realize the information fusion within the decision space. The fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under unknown operating conditions can be achieved by employing data under known multiple operating conditions for MDIFN training. The public Paderborn University (PU) bearing dataset and the actual mechanical comprehensive diagnosis simulation platform (MCDSP) bearing dataset from different testing rigs are considered to evaluate the cross-domain fault diagnosis performance of this method. The experimental results indicate that the method achieves an average accuracy of 95.97% on the PU dataset and 98.31% on the MCDSP dataset, which is superior to other state-of-the-art cross-domain fault diagnosis algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","","","","106","","Inf.

This gap is particularly pronounced with a view of African states. These generally have a limited capacity to cope with the effects of climate change. Therefore, foreign innovations must be successfully adopted to realities on the continent to mitigate the effects. This has sparked a growing academic interest in this topic in recent years, leading to many aspects being covered in the literature. This paper takes stock of the current state of the art, thereby asking the question: What do we know about the problems regarding international technology transfer to Africa? Employing a reproducible, transparent and clear systematic review, 73 relevant texts are identified. The barriers to more (successful) international technology transfer that these publications identify are discussed.

This study aims to systematically consolidate the measures used in the extant USO research into theoretical constructs, and connect the constructs to the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) perspective. In doing so, this study examines the effect of university-level characteristics on the number of USO establishments and USO performance; it also evaluates measurement validities that can reflect constructs. The systematic review and thematic coding reveal four groups of 14 constructs from the measures identified in prior studies: university general characteristics, university research characteristics, university entrepreneurial characteristics, and technology transfer office characteristics. Our meta-analyses indicate that the relationships between the constructs and USO outcomes are generally significant, thereby providing evidence of the convergent and nomological validities of the measures. Research design has a limited impact on the relationships, but country moderates several relationships between university characteristics and USO outcomes. Following our meta-analytic review, we explain the contribution to university entrepreneurship ecosystem research and suggest a theoretically triangulated model for future studies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","","","","21","","J.

We conducted a systematic review of HR actors' responses to institutional contradictions, which contained two questions: the first question identifies what institutional contradictions HR actors face and the second question reviewed HR actors' responses to these contradictions. We identified 52 articles for analysis after the screening. First, an overview of the theoretical lens, contexts, and dimensions of action in selected articles was presented. Then institutional contradictions including institutional pressures and conflict were reviewed and presented. Also, the types of actions were extracted and categorized from the articles. We presented a typology of four types of actions including (A) proactive legitimacy actions (institutional work, institutional entrepreneurship, and deinstitutionalization), (B) proactive institutional practices (combining logic, aligning interpretations, logic customization, and structural actions), (C) reactive institutional practices (use of logic, reducing tension, reconciliation and rejecting) and (D) reactive legitimacy actions (localization, adaptation, compliance, and institutional fit). This typology has two aspects: the type of actors' exposure to contradiction (proactive and reactive) and the direction of action (The Impact on the institutional context and conversely). Also, the epistemological distinctions of these four types of actions, the time and theoretical trends of the emergence of these actions in research, and the relevant conceptual framework were presented.

Employing a systematic literature review methodology based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the study investigates how human resources strategies within educational institutions can align with the Madani Framework to cultivate a workforce poised for success in high-value industries. The systematic review synthesizes findings from 28 relevant studies, comprising quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research, identified through a comprehensive database search and screening process. The included studies are categorized into seven distinct themes: graduate employability skills and competencies, curriculum alignment and industry relevance, HR practices in higher education, the Madani Framework and educational policies, university-industry collaboration, faculty development and continuous learning, and graduate employability and economic development. The review highlights a persistent skills mismatch between graduate competencies and evolving industry demands, underscoring the need for strategic interventions. HR practices emerge as a powerful catalyst, enabling higher education institutions (HEIs) to align curricula with industry needs, foster industry-relevant skills among graduates, and embed the Madani Framework's principles of sustainability, ethics, and social responsibility. Key recommendations include conducting curriculum mapping and gap analyses, engaging in stakeholder collaborations, integrating emerging technologies and Industry 4.0 skills, and establishing mechanisms for continuous curriculum review and faculty development. Furthermore, the review underscores the pivotal role of HR strategies in promoting and sustaining effective university-industry collaborations, facilitating knowledge exchange and experiential learning opportunities. Leveraging innovative HR practices, such as aligning recruitment processes and performance evaluation criteria with the Madani Framework's competencies, is crucial for fostering a holistic and socially responsible workforce. The study contributes valuable insights into the strategic role of HR in harmonizing educational outcomes with industry requirements, suggesting a model for leveraging human resource capabilities to fulfill the Madani Framework's aspirations. Recommendations are provided for policymakers, educators, and HR professionals to foster a collaborative, strategic approach to developing a resilient, adaptable, and employable graduate pool aligned with national development goals. © Proceedings of International Conference on Research in Education and Science 2024.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","2824-2844","","","10","","","","","","","","The International Society for Technology Education and Science","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 1 Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This research began with a careful systematic literature review of 4427 scientific papers published in the last ten years (2014–2023) and accessible in the prestigious Web of Science core collection. A quantitative methodology was used, complemented by the use of the visual analysis tool Posit PBC™, formerly known as R Cloud Studio. This comprehensive approach facilitated the seamless ingestion of raw data into Biblioshyni, which is a web-based platform specialised in bibliometric analysis. This review has revealed compelling trends, particularly in terms of increasing diversity, the emergence of United Kingdom as a major player, and the central role of university-industry collaboration. Our systematic review identified influential authors in the field, including the prolific contributions of scholars such as D. Radicid, S. Ropers, Y. Li and R. Owen. We also identified important research institutions, such as Utrecht University in Netherlands, Lund University in Sweden and The University of Manchester in the UK. In addition, we have shown that countries such as the United Kingdom, China and USA have made a significant contribution to the volume of publications. The results highlighted a marked increase in the phenomenon of univeristy spin-offs over the past decade, as evidenced by the exponential growth in both publication output and citation rates. This empirical revelation was underpinned by a rigorous exploration of the Web of Science database, using a carefully crafted set of keywords. Thirty-seven pivotal studies were selected for in-depth review through a sophisticated selection process that adhered to the rigorous standards of the PRISMA methodology. The aim of this review is to improve understanding and encourage deeper exploration of spin-off-based public universities through collaboration between academia and industry. © 2024 The Authors","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-26 14:48:33","","","","19","10","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","University-industry collaboration; Academic entrepreneurship; Absorptive capacity; Social capital; Innovation in public universities; Third mission of the university","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Industry benefits from state-of-the-art laboratories and technologies from academia, while institutes learn about business reality and market needs. Numerous barriers to the establishment and maintenance of these partnerships have been investigated and reported in the literature, but the information generated by these empirical studies is very fragmented and there is a need to consider the barriers systematically in order to clarify the topic. The aims of this systematic review were to analyze university-industry collaborations set up for the purpose of RD&I in an effort to recognize the barriers and facilitators of the process and to identify the approaches by which such barriers may be overcome. Following searches of the Scopus database and application of the exclusion criteria, 86 relevant articles were identified and submitted to bibliometric analysis. Subsequently, 75 articles were selected for in-depth content analysis, and the ideas embodied therein were presented in a structured and comprehensive manner. Barriers were evaluated according to three different theoretical perspectives, namely the triple helix and the entrepreneurial university, the relational social capital and value creation, and technology transfer and cultural differences. The facilitators were categorized as internal and external. The results obtained highlight the importance of fostering relational social capital and providing tax incentives to facilitate industry's pursuit of innovation through academia partnerships, and also show that collaborative barriers in RD&I may be overcome to some extent by starting with smaller projects and gradually increasing their complexity. Based on the findings outlined in this review, we propose various lines for future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-26 14:54:52","","1841-1877","","3","74","","Manag.

This research focuses on 3 sectors which are from 1) the government of Brunei to 2) the higher education institutions particularly Universiti Teknologi Brunei to 3) industry sectors in Brunei Darussalam - primarily in the processes of technology transfer. Using the Triple Helix theory model, barriers were identified between consecutive sectors. In this study, qualitative research methods have been utilized (case studies using interview methods) and a total of 9 main barriers have been identified between the sectors from the literature review which were then studied exclusively in the setting of Brunei. Identifying these barriers and its gap which is to identify the interrelationships between the barriers would provide a greater understanding into the complex nature of the innovation and technology transfer process, which can be considered as a valuable input towards crucial national and individuals' decision making. The study addresses this gap by determining innovation barriers in the Triple Helix Model and their intertwined relationships. The objective also seeks to comprehend the factors that contribute to successful technology transfer and to suggest the effectiveness that might be attained by enhancing technology transfer to universities, industry, and the government. The findings from the interviews are rather interesting as the reasoning for most barriers are different from other nations in the literature review. Despite this, the barriers have not been successfully addressed. This necessitates an evaluation of the government's strategy for achieving “Wawasan 2035”. © 2024 University of Brunei Darussalam.

We conducted a search of academic papers using research terms such as “Digital*, Digital transfor*, industry 4.0 (I4.0), industry 5.0, knowledge exploration, knowledge acquisition, ecosystem collaboration*, knowledge networks, and open innovation” in both the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Altogether, 108 papers met the criteria (e.g., ABS 2 & 2+ ranking of journals, only journal papers, and focusing on small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) digital transformation) for conducting a systematic literature review in this research. The results indicate that external actors play specific roles in supporting SMEs' digital transformation. We found that customers and suppliers push and encourage SMEs in their digital transformation, while coopetition can elicit greater technological benefits for SMEs with close technological and economic proximity. Intermediaries provide knowledge-brokering services, facilitate innovation processes, and enable technology transfer and capacity-building for SMEs’ digital transformation. Government initiatives, such as favorable policymaking and financial support, are important in promoting and facilitating a collaborative environment for technology development among SMEs. This study's results present two distinct collaborative mechanisms that SMEs can utilize for digital transformation: (I) core value chain and network actors’ collaborations, which provide linear processes for knowledge exploration and exploitation, and (II) ecosystem and innovation platform-based collaborations, in which SMEs adopt the ambidextrous approach as a nonlinear process for knowledge exploration and exploitation for digital transformation. Certain organizational-level factors (organizational capabilities, micro-foundations, operational capabilities, organization strategies, and culture) are important for SMEs’ knowledge exploitation in digital transformation. The study also presents an integrated framework and offers directions for future research and important insights for practitioners. © 2025","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","","","3","10","","J.

This study aims to systematically review, integrate, and analyze the domain of innovation and entrepreneurship courses using visual knowledge mapping technology, providing the academic community with a comprehensive examination of the current state of research in this field. We hope these findings will offer valuable references and guidance for future research and practice in innovation and entrepreneurship education. [Methods] This study employs CiteSpace visualization software for comprehensive bibliometric analysis of core academic literature spanning 19 years[1]. The detailed literature interpretation not only outlines the research trajectory in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship courses but also elucidates key research topics and prominent hotspots[11]. By systematically integrating innovation and entrepreneurship courses, this study delves into their structure, research focuses, and current frontier topics, providing a theoretical foundation and guiding future academic inquiries and practical applications[10]. [Results/Conclusions] Research on university innovation and entrepreneurship courses has matured into a well-developed field and exhibits new trends. The study reveals that prior to 2016, the number of academic papers related to this field grew slowly, but post-2017, there was a noticeable surge. Among the top 20 institutions by publication volume, 18 are from the United States, with the UK and France each contributing two, reflecting the dominant position of the US in this research field and indicating significant research strength and influence from the UK and France. According to keyword evolution sequences, research themes mainly include curriculum system construction, entrepreneurship research, innovation research, teaching model innovation reform, and artificial intelligence. Recently, information technology, big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have become new research hotspots, showing increasing research attention in these areas.  © 2024 ACM.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","145-150","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Two aspects were considered (i) the state of the art of the literature has been clarified through synthesis and discussion of six key themes: the main features and evolution of industrial doctorates; the design and implementation of industrial PhD programmes; the perspective of PhD candidates; the standpoint of university; the standpoint of industry; and industrial doctorates as policy tools for fostering innovation processes. There was a surge in publications after 2015, but these have mainly focused on the European context. Industrial doctorates are reshaping the doctoral education landscape as they are considered as educational tools for building bridges between academia and industry. However, there are still institutional and cultural barriers to legitimising industrial doctorates which are often considered as alternatives or even as the antithesis of ‘traditional’ PhDs; (ii) we suggest an agenda for future research to assess whether industrial doctorates do offer an effective response, or an optimal approach to meeting the demands of both the knowledge society and of doctoral candidates. Future research should seek to gather quantitative evidence in a wider variety of geographical areas, taking into account the distinctive features of both institutional contexts, and of the diverse scientific fields and industrial sectors involved.

Despite the critical role of KT in ensuring project sustainability and long-term organizational learning, limited scholarly attention has been given to identifying and systematically categorizing the success factors that influence KT outcomes in ESPs. The aim of this study is to investigate and conceptualize the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that influence effective knowledge transfer in ESPs. To address this research gap, a mixed-methods approach is used, combining a literature review with empirical insights from semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners involved in large-scale ESP implementations. The analysis reveals a set of interrelated CSFs that significantly impact KT effectiveness. Some of the key points highlighted are the shared knowledge between cultures, the high expertise of consultants based on technicality and social skills, and the solid and visible management support. These points are integrated into a conceptual framework that enhances conceptual understanding while offering practitioners practical guidance. The study contributes by bridging the gap between the KT concept and ESP implementation, which are connected to the academic discourse, proposing a comprehensive model for successful knowledge transfer during the deployment of ESP. From a practical standpoint, the findings offer organizations a strategic lens to design and implement KT mechanisms that enhance project outcomes and ensure long-term knowledge retention. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

However, they can be challenging for MNEs due to cultural and institutional differences between home and host markets. This poses a dilemma for MNEs, which is how to strike a balance between their knowledge transfer (KT) and knowledge protection (KP) strategies. It is notable that, so far, research has primarily investigated these two areas independently, lacking an integrative view. Therefore, in this article, we reviewed 98 academic articles exploring knowledge transfer/protection in MNEs operating under international joint venture (IJV) arrangements and assessed publications from the last two decades (2000–2022). Drawing from institutional theory and the bargaining power perspective, we developed a conceptual framework highlighting the external and internal factors influencing KT and KP. Subsequently, we contextualized these factors within the specific domain of IJVs, drawing on insights gleaned from the studies in our sample. The interplay of these factors, along with their contextual nuances, provides a holistic and in-depth understanding of how knowledge is managed within the complex dynamics of IJVs. In addition, our review contributes to our understanding of knowledge management in MNEs by identifying novel gaps in the literature and suggesting a number of avenues for future research. © 2024 The Authors","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","","","5","33","","Int.

Starting with a systematic literature review, this study identifies research addressing the topic of TTO and culture. It analyses, through a case study, the main characteristics of the organizational culture of a well-established and successful TTO using the Competing Values Framework. Results show that only limited scientific work emphasizes the nature of organizational culture of the TTO. In addition, the empirical findings show that the culture of the TTO should be an inclusive one spanning an interrelated and ambiguous set of cultural characteristics that embrace the culture of its various stakeholders in a pragmatic, professional, and service-oriented manner. In doing so the TTO bridges information and interpretation asymmetries among its multiple stakeholders. © The author/s, 2025.","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","23-35","","1","9","","CERN IdeaSquare J.

Still, the link between entrepreneurial intention and career is missing in previous studies. An extensive literature review developed the rationale that existing theories in the entrepreneurial discipline have limitations in linking entrepreneurial intention with career. This research is conducted to develop a comprehensive model for the relationship between entrepreneurial university support, student entrepreneurial intention, behavior and career. Stimulus-Organism-Behavior-Consequence (SOBC) paradigm from organizational behavior research is borrowed to entrepreneurship literature. Design/methodology/approach: The cross-sectional data was collected from Pakistani university students enrolled in business incubators. A sample of 100 responses was tested with a partial least square–structural equation modelling approach. Findings: The study established that by the underpinning of SOBC, entrepreneurial university support influences students’ entrepreneurial intention. It is also found that the students’ entrepreneurial intention strongly influences their entrepreneurial behavior, leading them to entrepreneurship careers. Research limitations/implications: The policies influencing students’ entrepreneurial intention and behavior can be developed using the SOBC paradigm. Higher education institutions can improve students’ entrepreneurial intentions and behavior to lead them to entrepreneurship careers. Originality/value: This research introduced the SOBC paradigm in entrepreneurial intention and behavior literature. SOBC underpinning explored a new dimension of entrepreneurial intention and behavior literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-26 14:39:00","","441-467","","3","13","","J.

This paper, through a systematic literature review, re-reads spin-off emergence as an organization-embedded dynamic using the lens of social information processing theory. Based on a thematic analysis that returns four conceptual themes (entrepreneurial university, institutional factors, human capital, and cognitive and psychological factors) a multi-level conceptual framework is proposed showing that both individual-level factors and elements of the university context have an effect, although in different ways, on the spin-off emergence dynamics. In recognizing spin-off formation as a complex and organization-embedded process of venture emergence, we further emphasize the need to complement driver identification with complexity-sensitive perspectives on organizational novelty. Building on these findings, we propose a research agenda emphasizing three open issues: (i) understanding the drivers of spin-off emergence, (ii) unpacking the processual perspectives on spin-off emergence, and (iii) disentangling the interplay between individual-level and university-level factors.

Nevertheless, many organizations encounter challenges during leadership transitions, often due to inadequate succession planning, insufficient leadership development frameworks, and the diminishing of organizational memory. This conceptual paper examines the relationship between succession planning, leadership development, and organizational memory. Succession planning enables organizations to proactively identify and prepare future leaders, thereby minimizing disruptions resulting from leadership changes. Leadership development is focused on systematically equipping high-potential employees with the essential skills, competencies, and experiences needed to step into leadership roles. Additionally, organizational memory—composed of institutional knowledge, historical insights, and experiential learning—plays a crucial role in safeguarding strategic knowledge and leadership expertise during transitions. The integration of these three components creates a robust leadership pipeline, reduces the risks associated with leadership voids, and fortifies the retention of institutional knowledge. This paper provides a critical analysis of existing literature concerning executive transitions, talent management, and knowledge retention, aiming to establish interlinks among these variables. The study emphasizes how organizations can utilize structured mentorship programs, knowledge transfer strategies, and leadership development initiatives to facilitate seamless leadership transitions. Furthermore, it addresses the obstacles to effective leadership continuity, such as short-term mindsets in succession planning, the failure to institutionalize leadership knowledge, and resistance to leadership changes. This conceptual paper adds value to both academic research and managerial practices by synthesizing insights from human resource management, strategic leadership, and organizational behavior. The findings highlight the necessity for organizations to embrace a comprehensive approach to leadership continuity, integrating succession planning, leadership development, and organizational memory into a unified strategy. The paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers, HR professionals, and corporate leaders on promoting sustainable leadership transitions in dynamic and competitive environments. © 2025 by the author; licensee Learning Gate.","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","2869-2877","","5","9","","Edelweiss Appl.

This academic article conducts a careful systematic review of the entrepreneurship curriculum in Indonesian higher education, examining important aspects to uncover existing conditions and identify opportunities for improvement. Emphasising the urgent need for in-depth exploration of the implementation of entrepreneurship education. Methods. A systematic literature review serves as a basis for summarising publications in a particular field of study. Systematic literature review using the method, which consists of five different stages. These stages include defining eligibility criteria, describing sources of information, literature selection, data collection, and selection of data items. This method proves advantageous as it can serve as a starting point or proposal for further research and analysis. Results. Among the 31 papers carefully selected for analysis, two prominent themes emerged: the implementation of entrepreneurship education programs and the development of entrepreneurial learning within Indonesian entrepreneurial universities. Most of the extensively selected articles focus on these themes. This research examines student entrepreneurial competence, mentoring, and various forms of entrepreneurial learning within the framework of higher education in Indonesia. Conclusion. In reviewing the landscape of Indonesia’s higher education entrepreneurship curriculum, it becomes clear that while strides have been made, significant challenges remain. The uniqueness of Indonesia’s demographics, coupled with economic dynamics, underscores the urgency of fostering entrepreneurship education. Despite growing demand, research reveals deficiencies in the effectiveness of current programs, emphasising the need for comprehensive research. The dearth of English-language scientific literature and publications requires innovative approaches, such as categorising accessible digital resources, to gather insights into common practice. © 2024, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

Applying the DoE still requires numerous experiments and is constrained to the design space, posing a risk of missing the potential optimum. To make a leap in model-based process development, applying extrapolating models can tremendously extend the design space and also allow for process understanding and knowledge transfer. While existing chromatography modeling software explains experimental data, it often lacks predictive power for new conditions. In academic–industrial cooperation, we demonstrate a new high-fidelity model based on biophysics for developing ion-exchange chromatography in biomanufacturing, making it a general tool in rationalizing process development for the present demand of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies and the emerging demand of new modalities. Using the new computational tool, we achieved predictability and attained high accuracy; with minimal experimental effort to calibrate the system, the mathematical model predicted sensitive process conditions, and even described product-related impurities, antibody charge variants. Thus, the computational tool can be deployed for process-by-design and material-by-design approaches. © 2025 by the authors.","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","","","6","12","","Separations","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","adsorption model; antibody; biomanufacturing; biophysics; charge variants; downstream processing; ion-exchange chromatography; model-based process development; protein; purification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the scalability of such interventions in Africa. In this study, we seek to assess the scalability of interventions for improving the functionality of health systems in Africa, as a key to large-scale implementation strategy of interventions with potential for impact. Methods: The study will deploy a multi-pronged approach, grounded in an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) approach. First, a multidisciplinary steering committee will be established, involving key female and male stakeholders in all stages of our study from its inception and as equal members of the research team for overseeing the project. Second, as part of the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method, evidence from a published systematic review will be used to develop the African Scalability Assessment Framework (AFROSAF), a series of multiple attributes for assessing the ability to scale a health system intervention in Africa. Third, the content of the AFROSAF will be validated using Delphi survey (within a deliberative dialogue) following the Lavis’ framework for knowledge transfer and a conceptual framework developed by Boyko et al. a multi-stakeholder consensus exercise with experts from Africa will be convened. The Likert scaled scalability attributes developed will be rated and descriptive statistics and hierarchical cluster analysis will be used to synthesize the data. Finally, document analyses will be conducted to rate to which extent each intervention has data that meet criteria responding to the essential components of scalability using the AFROSAF. We will conduct an analysis to score and rank each intervention for scalability. Discussion: This project proposes an approach aiming to catalyse the scale of interventions for effective functionality of health systems in Africa. The process will yield a scalability assessment tool for Africa and inventory scalable interventions. The findings will help African countries and policymakers understand the parameters to use and assess health system interventions for scaling. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","","","1","22","","Health Res.

The scientific literature on these programs frequently uses the terms “ride-sharing” and “safe-ride” interchangeably, though their meaning is not synonymous. This critical review set out to clarify the main characteristics of these programs to advance research, dissemination of the findings, and knowledge transfer in the alternative transportation field for AID and crash prevention. Method: A systematic literature search of six databases using the PRISMA-S checklist identified studies of ride-sharing and safe-ride programs to prevent AID or crashes. Inclusion criteria comprised studies published in academic and gray literature between 1980 and 2023. A six-step thematic analysis of included studies identified the defining characteristics of each program. Results: The 32 included studies evaluated for-profit ride-sharing/ride-hailing programs (n = 21) and safe-ride programs (n = 11). No studies on non-profit ride-sharing programs were identified. Analyses revealed two main themes. Operational strategies were most important for distinguishing between for-profit ride-sharing and safe-ride programs, with differences in these subthemes: purpose (revenue generation vs. AID reduction), management (private vs. private plus other strategies), funding (self-financing vs. external), and promotion (convenient transportation vs. dangers of AID). Service offerings, the second theme, highlighted differences in program costs, availability, accessibility, service capacity, coverage, and types of vehicles used. Discussion: The scientific literature on ride-sharing was limited to for-profit ride-sharing, suggesting that referring to them as “ride-hailing” in future studies would be more accurate. Both operational strategies and service offerings highlight the advantages and disadvantages of ride-hailing and safe-ride programs in the context of AID. Some programs referred to as ride-sharing programs have the same operational strategies as safe-ride programs, suggesting these be classified as safe-ride programs for conceptual coherence. © 2025 The Authors","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","365-372","","","93","","J.

To redesign the course, the instructors participated in a “course design institute” through Ohio State University's Michael V. Drake Institute for Teaching and Learning in May of 2023. The month-long program let the instructors through the Backward Design Process. This process allows instructors to first identify desired student outcomes and then design the course around those desired results. It should be noted that this bears a striking resemblance to user-centered design, a core tenet of this capstone course, in which designers strive to first understand their stakeholders before designing a solution. Employing the backward design process, the instructors first developed broad learning goals for the capstone course, which described what students would know how to do and what they would care about upon completing the two-semester capstone sequence. Next, the instructors identified learning outcomes, which describe what the students would be expected to know or formally do. This effort was followed by identifying assessment techniques and filling in the course's content. Key aspects of the design mindset which were infused in this new course included: being inquisitive and open, being empathetic to others' needs, being accepting of ambiguity, questioning critically, and a proclivity to taking purposeful action. The two instructors involved in this redesign both have experience in the industry of product design and development, and aimed to structure the course and project path to reflect many of the practices that designers and engineers might employ in the product development industry. Key practices that the instructors wanted to emphasize in the course included: research skills to gain understanding of stakeholders, contexts, and constraints relevant to a problem; a focus on problem finding & framing, rather than jumping right into a solution; developing divergent thinking to facilitate fluent and fruitful concept brainstorming; building communication skills beyond technical writing, to include visual communication and the importance of storytelling. This paper will share a review of literature relevant to factors surrounding a design mindset and how a design mindset can impact design practice in the world of product development. Additionally, this paper will share benchmarking of best practices from the product design and development industry. This paper will discuss the implementation of this new capstone course during the 2023-24 academic year. Future discussion will include: • Summary of student outcomes • Instructor reflection on implementation • Comparison of standard course evaluations from the first course in the sequence (comparing previous iterations of the course vs. current iteration) • Reflection from students on their experience with specific learning outcomes • Reflection from students on the value and utility of certain exercises and skills. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:24","2025-07-25 13:43:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ASEE Annu.

However, insufficient enterprise motivation in UIC persists as a fundamental challenge in practice, significantly impacting collaboration quality and effectiveness. While this issue demands attention, related research remains in preliminary stages. Through systematic literature review and empirical investigation of UIC practices, this study employs grounded theory to analyze the inducing factors, behavioral manifestations, behavioral effects, and coping strategies associated with insufficient enterprise motivation. The findings reveal a theoretical framework comprising four major categories (inducing factors, behavioral manifestations, behavioral effects, and coping strategies) and twelve initial categories. Insufficient enterprise motivation gradually emerges through the interplay of symbiotic subject factors (such as inadequate innovation capacity and strategic planning), symbiotic environmental factors (including policy and institutional environment and market competition), and symbiotic mechanism factors (such as benefit distribution and risk-sharing mechanisms). This motivational deficiency manifests in multiple dimensions, including inadequate strategic planning, declining participation enthusiasm, lack of emotional investment, and reduced resource allocation. The behavioral effects are both significant and complex, negatively influencing enterprises' willingness to participate and decision-making processes. Countermeasures can be approached from three dimensions: enhancing symbiotic subjects, optimizing symbiotic environments, and perfecting symbiotic mechanisms. This research not only enriches the theoretical framework in the UIC field but also provides theoretical support and practical guidance for stimulating enterprise participation and improving UIC effectiveness. © 2025 The Author","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-25 13:43:25","","","","","256","","Acta Psychol.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","Industry; human; university; Universities; Humans; cooperation; Cooperative Behavior; industry; motivation; Motivation; Adaptation, Psychological; Benefit distribution; coping; Coping Skills; Grounded theory; Insufficient enterprise motivation; Participation willingness; psychological adjustment; Risk-sharing mechanisms; Symbiosis theory; University-Industry Collaboration (UIC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effective adoption of blockchain requires a comprehensive and valid model that addresses the specific needs and contexts of HLIs. This study aims to assess the content validity of the Knowledge Integration Model for Blockchain in Higher Learning Institutions using Aiken’s V method. The proposed model was developed through a systematic literature review and refined with expert input. Content validity was evaluated by seven experts with backgrounds in education, blockchain technology, and information systems. Each item within the model was rated for its relevance, clarity, and representativeness using a Likert scale. The instrument, consisting of 50 items across six constructs, was evaluated by seven domain experts using Aiken’s V methodology. Each item was rated based on its relevance and clarity using a 5-point Likert scale. The results revealed that out of 50 items, 21 required revision or removal due to low Aiken’s V scores (<0.70), 21 were deemed acceptable but required minor revisions, and 8 demonstrated strong content validity (V ≥ 0.80). These findings underscore the importance of expert evaluation in refining research instruments and ensuring construct alignment. The use of Aiken’s V provided a robust quantitative foundation for the validation process. The refined instrument serves as a reliable tool for assessing institutional readiness and knowledge integration capabilities in the context of blockchain adoption. This work contributes to the growing research on educational blockchain implementation by offering a validated framework that can support empirical investigations and strategic decision-making in higher education. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

These incubators play a strategic role in bridging resource gaps, fostering innovation, and enhancing the survival and growth of early-stage ventures. Despite their increasing importance, there remains a limited understanding of how incubator performance directly influences startup outcomes. This study addresses that gap through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 920 scholarly articles published between 2010 and 2022, sourced from Scopus and Google Scholar. Using VOSviewer, the analysis identifies key research trends, influential publications, and thematic clusters related to incubator performance. The findings reveal a significant increase in research activity over the past decade, with a peak in 2018, and a strong concentration of publications in journals focused on technology transfer and innovation management. Prominent themes include academic entrepreneurship, incubator performance, technology transfer offices, and the role of innovation ecosystems involving academia, industry, and government. These themes highlight the multifaceted nature of incubator success and the importance of cross-sector collaboration. The study also emphasizes the need for integrated evaluation frameworks to enhance incubator effectiveness and guide institutional and policy-level strategies. The novelty of this research lies in its synthesis of bibliometric insights to propose future research directions and methodological improvements for assessing incubator performance. By mapping the intellectual landscape of incubator research, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how incubators can be optimized to support sustainable startup development and economic growth in emerging markets. © 2025 Authors.","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-25 13:43:25","","156-173","","1","24","","J.

However, it is unclear how the integration of the types of knowledge that are transferred in clinical practice manifests. Given this gap in understanding, the current research sought to build a conceptual map of knowledge transfer in clinical practice in central South Africa. Method: A qualitative approach was followed, and data to build the conceptual map was obtained from a scoping review that explored the landscape of knowledge transfer in occupational therapy clinical practice, nine semistructured interviews with occupational therapists working in central South Africa, and a Q Method survey. Results: The conceptual map–building process delivered a multidimensional, multidirectional conceptual map consisting of four concepts (theory and research, practice experience, patient–therapist relationship, and patient’s voice in clinical practice) and four types of knowledge (propositional, procedural, personal, and client). The results show the integration of the types of knowledge and confirm that knowledge transfer in clinical practice is a complex and ongoing process. Conclusion: The conceptual map, a first of its kind in South Africa, presents empirical evidence of knowledge that is created and transferred in clinical practice in central South Africa. The conceptual map might provide a framework for collaboration amongst all stakeholders, such as patients, occupational therapists, and academics, to produce practice guidelines and occupational outcome measures to support evidence-based clinical practice.

The methodology combined an exploratory quantitative analysis of the almost 17,000 applications, with a meta-evaluative qualitative analysis through interviews to key actors of the evaluation program and focus groups with evaluators. Hidden biases operating throughout and in each of the different phases of the KT&IS evaluation process were identified.

The entrepreneurial university has evolved as a “natural” incubator supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and sustainability in the university community (e.g., students, alumni, staff, and academics) and beyond civic engagement. Over the last four decades, academic debates on why and how higher education organizations could play this key role have become increasingly important in the business and management literature. It has motivated several special issues published in multidisciplinary academic journals, literature reviews, and theoretical-empirical contributions. However, there is a defragmentation of the literature given the unique nature of each entrepreneurial university during the current decade and the forced transformation of entrepreneurial organizations due to new (technological and health) paradigms. Therefore, this new decade opens the door for re-viewing the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence of entrepreneurial universities. Inspired by these universities’ challenges, this special issue represented a unique opportunity to build a novel theory that provides an updated theoretical view of the entrepreneurial university phenomenon (e.g., re-conceptualization, re-view missions, re-view business models, re-view metrics), as well as to offer new insights about how the new paradigms have transformed core entrepreneurial university activities (education, research, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship), strategies, and interconnectedness with ecosystems. This introductory paper encouraged an in-depth multidisciplinary conversation within the management and related research community from different socio-economic settings to make theoretical and empirical contributions. As a result, six papers have contributed to this special issue and provide several implications for different stakeholders.

This systematic review aimed to fill this gap by systematically identifying, describing and analyzing the available evidence. To be included, studies had to a) focus on primary or secondary teachers, b) report on a professional development program targeted at improving FA practices, c) measure teachers’ FA practices and d) represent an interventional study. We identified 23 eligible reports including quantitative and qualitative studies and extracted data on teacher and professional development program characteristics, outcomes and impact evidence. Our findings revealed that 69.56 % of professional development programs emphasized providing feedback to students, while less than 8.70 % included implementing rubrics, progress monitoring and integrating formative with summative assessments as learning outcomes. Evidence on the impact of professional development programs on teachers’ FA practices was very heterogeneous, consisting of only four studies with an intervention-control group design and 15 single group comparisons with diverse measurements including declarative, procedural and self-knowledge outcomes. Overarching topics in the qualitative evidence pointed to sources of support, difficulties, and knowledge transfer experienced by teachers in professional development programs on FA. Only six of the studies measured the impact of professional development programs on students’ learning in addition to teachers’ FA practices and almost exclusively focused on academic rather than socio-emotional outcomes. Overall, the evidence base is highly heterogeneous, showcasing the variety of approaches scholars have chosen to design, implement and measure the impact of professional development programs on FA. This heterogeneity underscores the complexity of the topic and offers insights into different components that need to be considered in future research, while representing a valuable guide for stakeholders aiming for evidence-based approaches for professional development programs on FA. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-25 13:43:25","","","","","131","","Int.

Despite its importance, academic expert findings remain relatively unexplored within the context of Indonesian language. Recent studies have primarily relied on static word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec to match documents with relevant expertise areas. However, Word2Vec is unable to capture the varying meanings of words in different contexts. To address this research gap, this study employs Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a state-of-the-art contextual embedding model. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of BERT on the task of academic expert finding. The proposed model in this research consists of three variations of BERT, namely IndoBERT (Indonesian BERT), mBERT (Multilingual BERT), and SciBERT (Scientific BERT), which will be compared to a static embedding model using Word2Vec. Two approaches were employed to rank experts using the BERT variations: feature-based and fine-tuning. We found that the IndoBERT model outperforms the baseline by 6–9% when utilizing the feature-based approach and shows an improvement of 10–18% with the fine-tuning approach. Our results proved that the fine-tuning approach performs better than the feature-based approach, with an improvement of 1–5%. It concludes by using IndoBERT, this research has shown an improved effectiveness in the academic expert finding within the context of Indonesian language. © 2024, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

The research emphasizes traditional technology transfer mechanisms, particularly the roles of Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) and Technology Transfer Companies (TTCs). To assess the effectiveness of these models, apart from the literature review and secondary data analysis, six in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from Hungary and Israel. This qualitative approach provided insights into the dynamics that shape technology transfer practices, highlighting differences between the two countries' systems. Israel's technology transfer is marked by flexibility and proactive government policies. Israeli TTCs prioritize licensing over patenting, which allows for greater adaptability in commercialization. This model supports continuous innovation by enabling universities to reclaim and further develop innovations if startups fail. In contrast, Hungary's system, though evolving, tends to focus on patenting and direct commercialization, often missing opportunities for early-stage collaboration between academia and industry. The slower governmental response and weaker integration between universities and industry hinder the effectiveness of technology transfer in Hungary. The study suggests that Hungary could enhance its technology transfer framework by adopting more flexible commercialization strategies, fostering stronger university-industry collaborations, and improving governmental responsiveness. While Hungary's system differs from Israel's, elements of the Israeli model could be adapted to strengthen Hungary's technology transfer capabilities. © 2025 The Authors","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-25 13:43:25","","","","2","11","","J.

The German Consortium Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC) has implemented this recommendation in its care concept for families at risk. Core elements are the outcome-oriented evaluation of structured and standardized clinical measures and reporting recommendations derived therefrom to primary care providers and patients. A cross-sector network with certified breast cancer and gynecological cancer centers was founded in 2015, starting from the Cologne Center of the GC-HBOC. To guarantee the knowledge transfer for mainstream genetic counseling, the Cologne center has established an educational program for physicians and specialized nurses in order to pilot trans-sectoral knowledge transfer on risk assessment and risk-stratified care. It consists of face-to-face lectures with written knowledge test, attending a genetic case conference and genetic counseling sessions with the opportunity to counsel under supervision. The lectures were accompanied by a structured evaluation of the participants' satisfaction and feedback of the needs in mainstream genetic counseling. Thereby, the network ensures that genetic counseling and testing is provided according to state-of-the-art knowledge and allows physicians to participate in knowledge-generating care outside the university setting and patients to receive care close to home. After multiple feedback cycles to improve the educational program, the GC-HBOC, in cooperation with the German Cancer Society, has now adopted this concept and developed a common and uniform online curriculum funded by the Federal Ministry of Health. https://www.krebsgesellschaft.de/fortbildung-familiaerer-krebs.html. © 2024 The Authors.

Despite a growing body of literature on this topic, a comprehensive review remains lacking. This study addresses this need by conducting a bibliometric and visualization analysis of 489 articles from the Web of Science database, providing an overarching understanding of the field’s size, dynamics, structure, and emerging trends. Using performance analysis and science mapping with VOSviewer and CiteSpace software, the research identified the most influential countries, journals, and authors; mapped the intellectual structure through co-citation analysis; and highlighted current research streams through bibliographic coupling, including green innovation, corporate social responsibility efforts, sustainable supply chain management, and inter-organizational learning. Co-word analysis uncovered research hotspots and future directions, emphasizing the centrality of absorptive capacity in linking knowledge acquisition to environmental strategies and organizational performance. Based on these findings, a systematic framework for applying absorptive capacity in the green context was developed, providing practical guidance for managers to enhance sustainability performance and competitive advantage.

This approach is highly challenged by increasing system complexity. Formal verification lends a powerful framework for model-based safety assurance, but due to the mixed discrete–continuous behavior of automotive systems, traditional tools for discrete program verification are helpful but not sufficient. In academia, during the last two decades new approaches arose for the formal verification of such mixed discrete-continuous systems. However, the industry is not fully aware of this development, the tools are seldom tried and their applicability is not well examined. In a Ford–RWTH research alliance project, we aimed at evaluating the potential of knowledge and technology transfer in this area. This paper has two main objectives. Firstly, we want to report on the state-of-the-art in the above-mentioned academic development in a generally understandable form, targeted to interested potential users. Secondly, we want to share our observations after testing different available tools for their applicability and usability in the automotive sector and as a conclusion devise some recommendations. © The Author(s) 2023.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-25 13:43:25","","49-78","","1","26","","Int.

Most spatiotemporal predictive algorithms ignore the valuable backward reasoning ability and the disparate learning complexities among different layers and hence, cannot build good long-term dependencies and spatial correlations, resulting in suboptimal solutions. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal predictive model with bidirectional distillation and level-specific meta-adaptation (SeeMore) in this paper, which includes a bidirectional distillation network (BDN) and a level-specific meta-adapter (LMA), to gain bidirectional multilevel reasoning. In the first stage, BDN concentrates on bidirectional dynamics modeling and coarsely constructs spatial correlations of different layers, while LMA is introduced in the second fine-tuning stage to refine the multilevel spatial correlations from a meta-learning perspective. In particular, BDN mimics the forward and backward reasoning abilities of humans in a distillation manner, which aids in the development of long-term dependencies. The LMA views learning of different layers as disparate but related tasks and guides the transfer of learning experiences among these tasks through learning complexities. Thus, each layer could be closer to its solutions and could extract more informative spatial correlations. By capturing the enhanced short-term spatial correlations and long-term temporal dependencies, the proposed model could extract adequate knowledge from sequential historical observations and accurately predict future frames whose backtracking preconditions are consistent with the historical sequence. Our work is general and robust enough to be integrated into most spatiotemporal predictive models without requiring additional computation or memory cost during inference. Extensive experiments on four widely used predictive learning benchmarks validated the proposed model’s effectiveness in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., 10.6% improvement of Mean Squared Error on the Moving MNIST dataset). © Science China Press 2024.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-25 13:43:25","","","","8","67","","Sci.

It categorizes these barriers into economic barriers, high upfront costs, organizational challenges, such as technical expertise and behavioral barriers, namely risk aversion and framing. To address these barriers, a comprehensive review of energy efficiency policies is conducted. These policies include incentives, coercive instruments, award systems, university industry collaboration, and technical support. To review energy efficiency barriers and policies, a methodological approach integrating non-structured snowball sampling with targeted literature review techniques was devised. Finally, the paper underlines that the success of these policies is contingent upon the active involvement, the collaboration, and the feedback of businesses, ensuring the feasibility of these policies.

We identified four linkage models: classical transfer of technology (ToT), moderate ToT with feedback, constructivist, and pragmatic. These models are based on different scientific paradigms, communication theories, and academic thinking about innovation. They propose different power relationships among actors and recognise their agency and otherness in different degrees. The findings show continuities between the ToT models and important differences between the models that value the active participation of farmers.

To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of the institutional entrepreneurship literature using a resource-based lens and identified a sample of 155 papers published from 1980 to 2019. Our coding analysis identified tangible and intangible resources and resource mobilisation strategies in the institutional entrepreneurship literature.

By doing so, it contributes to the existing literature on university–industry collaboration by identifying and addressing the specific challenges that impede the establishment of successful university–industry partnerships in Armenia and other post-Soviet countries. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the barriers, benefits and institutional, functional framework of collaboration. Additionally, this study used a survey methodology to gather data from faculty managing staff members at six Armenian higher educational institutions on various aspects of university–industry collaboration as well as the perceptions and experiences of the participants. Findings: The results show that the effectiveness and applicability of the university–industry collaboration channels and institutional structures in six higher educational institutions are limited. Specifically, the channels that rely on academic entrepreneurship and innovation were found to be currently unviable. Moreover, the existence of spin-offs and start-ups is notably absent. Furthermore, limited access to funding and inadequate entrepreneurial support systems pose significant barriers to developing university–industry partnerships in Armenian reality. Originality/value: This study represents a pioneering effort within the context of Armenian higher educational institutions, as it is the first time a survey has been organized to specifically investigate the topic of university–industry partnerships. Before this study, there was a lack of empirical research and data collection on this topic in Armenian higher education settings. Therefore, this research holds significant originality and contributes to filling the existing gap in knowledge regarding university–industry partnerships in Armenia.

Although there is a well-established body of work on how farmers adopt agricultural research outcomes and the factors that influence their adoption, research on how researchers perceive the process of transferring their results to practical applications, along with the factors that facilitate or hinder this process, remains inadequate. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review of empirical studies on knowledge transfer and its determinants from the perspective of agricultural researchers, covering publications from 1960 to 2024. It offers two key contributions: first, an original taxonomy of the channels through which agricultural research is transferred to farmers, and second, an integrative conceptual framework that links knowledge transfer to three categories of influential factors, related to researchers’ individual characteristics, the organizational context within research institutions, and the external environment. Based on the findings, a research agenda has been developed to serve as a foundation for future investigations into persistent gaps in the field.

However, no systematic review has yet been conducted to synthesize its research developments. In order to investigate the current landscape, research frontiers, and future trajectories of ECL studies in China, this study employs bibliometric data from the China National Knowledge Network (CNKI) citation database. Through CiteSpace-based knowledge mapping analysis, we construct a research paradigm model and conduct visual analytics of domestic ECL scholarship. The findings reveal the following: (1) Embodied-Cognitive Linguistics research in China currently demonstrates vigorous development momentum, with sustained growth in annual publication output. While multiple collaborative author teams have emerged, inter-team cooperation remains limited. Professor Wang Yin from Sichuan International Studies University stands as the most prolific scholar in this domain. (2) The disciplinary influence of domestic ECL research remains constrained, with most publications confined to foreign language and literature studies involving limited linguistic varieties. Establishing a multidimensional, multidisciplinary, and multilingual research paradigm is imperative to gain recognition from both international Cognitive Linguistics communities and domestic Chinese linguistics circles. (3) Current research hotspots concentrate on three dimensions: philosophical origin-tracing, theoretical framework construction, and practical applications. (4) Future developmental trajectories will emphasize utilizing Embodied-Cognitive principles to profoundly reinterpret the contemporary value of Chinese classics while establishing translation theories with Chinese characteristics, thereby constituting an emerging research paradigm within domestic ECL studies.

The research follows the Design Science Research methodology, introducing Nudge Evidence Briefing (NEB) to facilitate the understanding, access, application of academic findings on nudges for non-academic professionals, considering the gap between academic research on nudges and their practical application. Leveraging insights from the Evidence-Based Medicine framework, NEBs distill key findings from primary research into concise, accessible documents. Through a systematic review of the literature on nudge integration into software privacy and security, 12 primary studies were selected and the data extracted from them was formatted into NEBs. Participants, specialists and non-specialists, were invited to evaluate the NEB through online questionnaires. Feedback highlighted the clarity and structured format of the NEB, with particular praise for its ability to communicate complex scientific evidence in an accessible way. Overall, the NEB demonstrates significant promise in making nudge-related research more accessible and feasible. Ongoing refinements based on participant feedback will be crucial to realizing its full potential, contributing to the advancement of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the practical application of nudges in professional environments.

Despite extensive studies on university-industry collaboration (UIC), there is a gap in the research on the micro-framework of University-SMEs collaboration (USC). This study addresses this gap by focusing on the interaction between universities and SMEs, intending to provide a detailed understanding of the influencing factors between universities and SMEs. This study conducted a systematic literature review of articles on USC from 2010 to 2023 and explored the internal and external factors that influence the success of USC. In terms of influencing factor analysis, this study ultimately focused on four conceptual groups: University-SMEs relationship (USR), University innovation and cooperation management (UICM), Actors, resources and capabilities (ARC), and Innovative concepts and spirit (ICS). Simultaneously, sub-items were expanded based on the conceptual groups to derive an overall conceptual framework that outlines the influencing factors of USC. The findings are expected to significantly impact academic literature and management practices, offering insights to enhance university-driven technology transfer to SMEs. © 2013 IEEE.","2025","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-26 14:56:49","","45753-45770","","","13","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","Technological innovation; Conceptual frameworks; Technology managements; technology transfer; Systematic literature review; Research and development management; systematic literature review; conceptual framework; Innovation management; Scientific researches; Small and medium-sized enterprise; technological innovation; Enterprise collaboration; micro-research; Micro-research; technology management; University-small and medium-sized enterprise collaboration; university-SMEs collaboration (USC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, this endeavor has entailed scouring literature and attending conferences to stay abreast of fellow scholars' work. Nonetheless, this conventional method is notably time-consuming and inefficient, demanding researchers invest countless hours in perusing publications or navigating conference agendas. Recognizing this challenge, a compelling need arose for a more efficient approach to knowledge acquisition and synthesis. Herein, a pipeline system powered by Natural Language Processing technologies, including ChatGPT, BERT, and Knowledge Graphs was introduced. This system has been crafted to intelligently analyze academic literature, facilitating the rapid and precise identification of relevant researchers.

In recent years, there has been a remarkable upsurge of interest in partial domain adaptive fault diagnosis models. The majority of advanced methodologies strive to alleviate the issue of negative transfer by reducing the influence of outlier classes. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that outlier classes within the source domain still encompass valuable sensor information, which can significantly enhance the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To maximize the utility of outlier class samples instead of discarding them outright, we propose a method named principal properties attention matching (PPAM). First, we employ the principal properties extractor (PPE) to capture common features of fault instances from both shared and outlier classes, thereby characterizing the inherent relationships among the samples. Subsequently, we leverage the principal properties attention responder (PAR) to compute the properties-responsive weights, introducing an embedding-level weighting mechanism to achieve a more fine-grained matching and facilitate better domain adaptation in fault diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments performed under the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn, and PHM09 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method for industrial fault diagnosis. Specifically, on the more challenging Paderborn dataset, PPAM demonstrates a 2.77% increase in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:25","2025-07-25 13:43:25","","1-12","","","73","","IEEE Trans.

These are distinct from University Research Organizations (UROs), despite both being publicly funded. While UROs are populated with student-faculty teams focused on academic research, PROs are populated with full-time professional researchers focusing largely on post-academic research. Technology transfers from PROs are important for national economic development and hence are worth a study. The objective of this paper is to study literature to (a) explore tech-transfer characteristics such as mechanisms, actors, success factors, stages, and models, and b) to gather any relevant insights. The method of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was adopted for this study. Compared to conventional narrative review, SLR offers a replicable, scientific, and transparent process that aims to minimize bias and provides an audit trail of the reviewer’s decisions. Hence, SLR by itself is considered a research. Among the various methods for the literature-analysis such as bibliographic analysis, meta-analysis and thematic analysis, this paper adopts thematic analysis consistent with the objectives of research and the limited size of the literature on the topic.

To support the improved practice of KE, we conducted a scoping literature review evaluating 56 empirical case studies globally to identify enabling conditions for implementing effective KE. Identified enabling conditions were organized into a core capacities framework, which highlighted essential elements of effective KE from organizational, individual, financial, material, practical, political, and social capacity dimensions. Results show that major enablers to effective KE relate to practitioners' individual and organizational capacity including the ability of practitioners (often boundary spanners) to establish trust with relevant actors through their interpersonal relationships and possessing sufficient background knowledge and skills to facilitate collaborations across disciplines and sectors. We also identified main challenges to engaging in KE (e.g., insufficient long- term funding for projects, lack of interpersonal skills for KE practitioners to build relationships and network, and inadequate background knowledge for practitioners to exchange knowledge in an accessible manner), and the outcomes and impacts that can emerge from effective KE work. We find that practitioners often perform quantitative evaluations that provide instantaneous and measurable impacts for the effectiveness of KE, but do not capture the impact of interpersonal relationships and trust that are best achieved through qualitative approaches. Lastly, the synthesis of enablers, challenges, outcomes, and impacts presented in this paper can be a resource for practitioners to identify what enablers may be missing from their KE strategies and in what capacity the KE work can be strengthened. © 2024 The Author(s).

Moreover, there is no general definition of healthy buildings that could act as a reference for different stakeholders of the building sector. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework for healthy buildings and a definition for compiling existing knowledge and addressing the needs and gaps. The holistic approach of the framework was developed through an extensive literature review and tested with 12 building case studies in the major European climate zones. The framework outlines five different dimensions (improving mental and physical health, designed for human needs, sustainably built and managed, resilient and adaptive, empowering people), including 24 indicators and sub-indicators. The validation of the framework revealed that it is possible to assess different building projects against different indicators under each dimension. However, challenges remain due to issues such as lack of time, cost of data collection, or lack of documentation. The developed framework provides a balanced approach that promotes both individual well-being and broader sustainability goals. It provides necessary guidance to inform practitioners and policy makers as well as other building sector stakeholders to integrate healthy buildings thinking into their project development, assessment, and decision making. © 2024 The Authors","2024","2025-07-25 13:43:26","2025-07-25 13:43:26","","","","","324","","Energy Build.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Sustainability; Knowledge transfer; Academic research; Health; Resilience; Buildings sector; Design construction; Design management; Healthy buildings; Healthy Buildings; Holistic approach; Human centric; Human-centric; Indoor environmental quality; Indoor Environmental Quality; Sustainable building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To accelerate GLPs’ development amid the escalating climate crisis, this research examines this intersection by comparing the responsiveness of academia and practice to the call for green logistics over time.Design/methodology/approachTo compare between academia and practice, we combined a systematic literature review on the development of GLPs in L&SCM journals (N = 122) with a content analysis of annual and sustainability reports published by the four major global logistics service providers (LSPs: DHL, DB Schenker, UPS and FedEx; N = 156) over the past three decades.FindingsThis research reveals that all the GLPs covered in the L&SCM literature have already been applied and reported by practitioners, both consistently and over a significant period of time. Academic progress, in turn, is delayed by slow-paced empirical methods, elevated research quality standards, prolonged funding and recruitment processes, and extended peer-review intervals. Further, a tendency toward reactive knowledge creation rather than proactive knowledge transfer is evident, obscuring the role of L&SCM scholars in steering the industry’s green advancement.Practical implicationsRecommendations are offered to L&SCM authors, editors, reviewers and university departments to advance pracademic endeavors in green logistics research and increase its responsiveness to global events.Originality/valueThis is one of the first studies to scrutinize the intersection between academia and practice on the evolution of GLPs. The revealed gaps prompted us to suggest a transformative paradigm for academia-practice collaborations targeting the L&SCM discipline at large, combining a bold proactive research stream aimed at knowledge transfer with a more traditional reactive stream aimed at knowledge creation.","2025","2025-07-25 14:14:26","2025-07-25 14:14:26","","341","","4","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3202890310","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","","Climate change; Literature reviews; Social responsibility; Supply chains; Supply chain management; 49111:Postal Service; 49211:Couriers and Express Delivery Services; Annual reports; Content analysis; Emissions; Environmental Sustainability; Green Logistics Evolution; Logistics; Logistics Service Providers; Lsp; Postal & delivery services; Practical Relevance; Quality standards; Shipper; Supply Chain Disruptions; Sustainability reporting; Transportation--Trucks And Trucking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theory of planned behavior emerged as a framework linking entrepreneurial identities to intentions, explaining how cognitive structures influence entrepreneurial roles. A gap was noted in defining academic entrepreneurial identity. It is suggested to combine the theory of social entrepreneurial identity with interdisciplinarity, incorporating liquid modernity theory and a fluvial metaphor to propose the concept of Liquid Academic Entrepreneurial Identity, opening new research paths.

This systematic literature review scrutinizes the deployment and efficacy of BI and data mining technologies across SME sectors, assessing their impact on operational efficiency, strategic decision-making, and market competitiveness. Therefore, drawing from a methodologically rigorous analysis of 93 scholarly articles published between 2014 and 2024, the review elucidates the evolving landscape of BI tools and techniques that have shaped SME practices. It reveals that advanced analytics such as predictive modeling and machine learning are increasingly being adopted, though significant gaps remain, particularly shaped by economic factors. The utilization of BI and data mining enhances decision-making processes and enables SMEs to adapt effectively to market dynamics. Despite these advancements, SMEs encounter barriers such as technological complexity, high implementation costs, and substantial skills gaps, impeding effective utilization. Our review, grounded in the analysis of business intelligence tools used indicates that dashboards (31.18%) and clustering techniques (10.75%) are predominantly utilized, highlighting their strategic importance in operational settings. However, a considerable number of studies (66.67%) do not specify the BI tools or data mining techniques employed, pointing to a need for more detailed methodological transparency in future research. The predominant focus on the ICT and manufacturing sectors underscores the industrial context sector specific applicability of these technologies, with ICT accounting for 45.16% and manufacturing 22.58% of the studies. We advocate for targeted educational programs, development of user-friendly and cost-effective BI solutions, and strategic partnerships to facilitate knowledge transfer and technological empowerment in SMEs. Empirical research validating the impacts of BI and data mining on SME performance is crucial, providing a directional pathway for future academic inquiries and policy formulation.","2025","2025-07-25 14:14:26","2025-07-26 14:39:25","","22","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3223880340","","","Place: Hawthorn Publisher: MDPI AG","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/Kw6rc?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=k99K8nFqHeg5LmQz%2FXd8pDtbHBc%3D","systematic review; Decision making; Competitive advantage; competitive advantage; data mining; Business And Economics; business intelligence; Business intelligence; economic factors; geographic context; resource-constrained environments; Small & medium sized enterprises-SME; SMEs performance; Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services; BUSINESS intelligence; DATA analytics; DATA mining; ECONOMIC competition; INDUSTRIAL efficiency; SMALL business; STRATEGIC planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the critical success factors for the creation of entrepreneurial universities in Botswana. Our core research question asks: What are the critical success factors for the transformation of public universities into entrepreneurial universities? The study used a descriptive literature review methodology to collect secondary data. A data set of 150 articles were reviewed which dated from 1987 to 2024. Data sources identified were books, academic journals, academic papers, technical reports, theses, articles, and working papers from reputable academic databases such as Scopus, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ProQuest, Research Gate, Scientific Research Publishing and Wiley. The study revealedfour main success factors in creating entrepreneurial universities - strategic, internal, environmental and external. The study underscored the need for resources, entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurial leadership and entrepreneurial culture in the creation of an entrepreneurial university. Moreover, flexible governance structure, enterprise support policies, role model and reward system, entrepreneurial architecture and collaborations with stakeholders were also highlighted as crucial for a successful transformation of public universities into entrepreneurial universities. The study further revealed that the transformation requires external support mechanisms from government, industry, and regional interventions. Consequently, creating an entrepreneurial university requires a collective effort between the university itself, government, industry and regional interventions. The implication is that public universities should forge partnerships and synergies with external stakeholders to transform into entrepreneurial universities. In light of the above, the study recommends the adoption of a quadruple helix model in creating entrepreneurial universities. Future research is recommended to fully evaluate the efficacy of the quadruple helix model in the development of an entrepreneurial university.

Tiga puluh lima artikel yang diterbitkan di antara tahun 2012 dan 2022 diperoleh daripada Clarivate Web of Science diringkas, disemak, dan disintesis.

Current literature lacks discussions regarding important predictors for becoming an entrepreneur, especially among lecturers. Because technological developments make it possible for a lecturer to become an internet entrepreneur, this study conducted a systematic literature review of articles related to identifying individual predictors that can affect internet entrepreneurial ventures among academics. Thirty-five articles published between 2012 and 2022 and sourced from the Clarivate Web of Science are summarized, reviewed, and synthesized. The findings show that human capital, social capital, and internet competence are important individual predictors that influence internet entrepreneurial ventures among lecturers. This study also proposes the use of a new fourth variable, academic internet entrepreneurial self-efficacy, to explain the phenomenon of academic internet entrepreneurship among lecturers. This study contributes to the understanding of individual predictors that influence internet entrepreneurial ventures among academics and whether lecturers can act as educators and entrepreneurs at the same time.

Thus, studying the entrepreneurial intention (EI) of students enables the development of practices and public policies.

Works available in full until 2022 that addressed at least two TPB antecedents were included. Works that were not articles that included university students were excluded.

Agri-food organizations, traditionally characterized by low-knowledge management (KM) practices, are facing several challenges that require new knowledge to improve performance and their ability to survive. Since agri-food organizations are low-propensity R&D, they are forced into a collaborative approach and the creation of inter-organizational relationships (IORs) for knowledge transfer. The purpose of this study is to offer an overview of the academic literature on knowledge transfer within scientific institutions and agri-food organizations.Design/methodology/approach>This study is based on a systematic literature review. In particular, two international and multidisciplinary databases (Scopus and WoS) were considered. Subsequently, the scientific documents were selected following the PRISMA guidelines. In addition, a scientific landscape visualization was created through VOSviewer software.Findings>The study offers interesting reflections and suggestions on the management of inter-organizational relations in the agri-food sector.

Subsequently, a content analysis was carried out on 50 articles, which made it possible to identify twelve different frameworks for the EU from 1998 to 2021. Internal restructuring, innovation, internationalization, hybridization, R&D, sustainability, global interaction with companies, associations and institutions, active methodologies, high-intensity research, among other aspects. These elements jointly raise the level of institutions. Finally, the novelty focuses on the elaboration of a final framework, which synthesizes the models that the literature presents, and the theoretical approaches, in short, follow institutional theory and economic theory and, implicitly, are integrated by formal environmental factors. and informal ones that positively or negatively influence the university development process to different degrees.","2022-08","2025-07-25 14:14:27","2025-07-25 14:14:27","","233-267","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2735285531","","","Place: Rio De Janeiro Publisher: Associação Nacional dos Cursos de Graduação em Administração- ANGRAD","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/f2hwP?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=Rp7pNAB%2ByfYd3dWzLDE5hnEvtT8%3D","Research; Systematic review; Entrepreneurship; Public policy; Higher education; Knowledge; Accountability; University; Institutions; Strategic management; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Business And Economics--Management; Colleges & universities; Entrepreneurs; United States--US; Area planning & development; Institutionalisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This also led to the rise and growth of the “entrepreneurial university” concept. Factors that promote entrepreneurial universities include funding, self-reliance, academic freedom, better linkage to industry, innovation, provide employment, and promote social and economic development. Hence, worldwide, entrepreneurial universities are increasingly recognized as an important constituent to tackle fiscal and employment issues. However various reports and studies reflect that entrepreneurial universities have not achieved these objectives. That may be due to the challenges and lack of critical success factors (CSFs) understanding to be entrepreneurial university. Hence, adopting an exploratory approach with a systematic literature review this paper intends to focus on the challenges of entrepreneurial universities and identifies the CSFs to thrive as entrepreneurial universities, and provides recommendations to succeed as entrepreneurial universities.","2022","2025-07-25 14:14:27","2025-07-25 14:14:27","","1-15","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2904579773","","","Place: Manchester Publisher: IGI Global","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/z2wlW?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=MevlNu4bbWnpibFscYTe4XLW%2F1I%3D","Systematic review; Innovation; Literature reviews; Entrepreneurship; Policy; Critical success factor; Economic development; Development; Employment; Creativity; Business; Success factors; Challenge; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Colleges & universities; Application; Essentials; Ideas; Programs; Promote","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research combines a two-level approach by correlating both a qualitative-bibliometric analysis and a quantitative exploratory analysis. To identify the theoretical descriptors of the “entrepreneurial university” concept we performed a cluster analysis by using VOSviewer software selecting the published articles in the Scopus database since its beginning. The relevance of this analysis consists in the opportunity of extracting the most relevant information on the analyzed topic according to several criteria such as keywords, co-occurrence, co-citation, or publication topics by year. From this perspective the pieces of evidence are meaningful and we shall present them within the sections of the paper. On the other hand, for obtaining a practice grounded perspective, we applied 350 questionnaires to a target group involved in a university grant for young entrepreneurs. The purpose of the survey was to determine a series of characteristics and patterns of behavior of respondents related to their entrepreneurial orientation. The questionnaire contained a large number of variables for each individual to identify his/her distinct options and thus to draw the big picture. The variables were grouped into 6 dimensions which we identified as a priority for the entrepreneurial orientation framework: personal traits, motivation, attitude, framework conditions, and skills and knowledge. We statistically processed the survey data to identify the most meaningful correlations and interdependencies between the variables. The results of both research protocols are correlated and argued within the final section of the paper followed by conclusions and further research tracks.","2021","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-26 14:41:38","","460-475","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2811203933","","","Place: Warsaw Publisher: De Gruyter Poland","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/cbsfV?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=MXaZ7msQ0iVWfl4svONI%2FvSDRDs%3D; https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/mOaEM?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=lNvDCWIK9i%2BrKHBYB3Ejv7SCAH4%3D","Economics; Students; innovation; Bibliometrics; Education; Entrepreneurship; technology transfer; Collaboration; entrepreneurial university; University; Entrepreneurial orientation; Cluster analysis; Strategic planning; Software; third mission; Entrepreneurs; Business And Economics; Qualitative research; Research & development--R&D; Keywords; Society; entrepreneurial behavior; entrepreneurial ecosystem; Student; student start-ups; Emerging markets; Extracurricular activities; Investigations; Questionnaires; Semantics; CLUSTER analysis (Statistics); COLLEGE students; PUBLISHED articles; QUANTITATIVE research; RESEARCH protocols","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The empirical research aims at evaluation of critical factors supporting the creation and development of academic start-ups as well as obstacles to setting up academic ventures. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper draws on a broad literature review, covering various approaches to the concept of technological entrepreneurship. The author tries to critically analyze and synthesize the views of scholars on this phenomenon using the following methods: exploration, interpretation, comparing, analysing features, and inferring. The empirical research applies the method of in-depth structured direct interviews with experts in the field of commercialization and technology transfer, academic entrepreneurship, and start-up incubation. Both descriptive and explanatory techniques were used in the presented study. Findings: The research findings provide insightful guidance for the ways of supporting start-ups with academic origin and for more effective business-science cooperation. The current reflections on the concept of technological entrepreneurship in management sciences confirm the multidimensionality of the phenomenon and two main research lines, namely one focused on technological innovations created and implemented mainly by high-tech enterprises, and the other one on academic entrepreneurship and the intellectual potential of universities and R&D institutes for commercialization of research findings leading to development of innovative products and services. Practical Implications: The synthesis of the current reflections on the concept of technological entrepreneurship and the research findings reflected here can benefit both entrepreneurship teachers' practice at HEIs, researchers, and employees of business incubators as a source for further analysis and the relevance of the methods used. Originality/Value: The originality of the conducted exploratory research lies in presenting the factors supporting operations of academic start-ups diagnosed by the author and their evaluation by experts with many years of experience in the field of business-science collaboration. Moreover, the paper provides an integrated research framework that build on and add value to the previous research on technological entrepreneurship in management sciences.","2021","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-25 14:14:28","","30-47","","","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2639731053","","","Place: Anixis Publisher: Professor El Thalassinos","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/sWqIM?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=wXzLtV8BAO65xmJyV9H63vcaUKM%3D","Technology transfer; Entrepreneurship; University spin-off; Collaboration; Management science; Startups; Cooperation; Entrepreneurs; Research design; Business And Economics; 54161:Management Consulting Services; Business incubators; Research & development--R&D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivation: Entrepreneurial universities are pivotal in contemporary economic systems due to their significant contributions in innovation efforts. Part of their mission is seen in the commercialization of their scientific knowledge through the creation of spin-offs (Cvijic et al., 2019; O'shea et al., 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2019). The challenges and constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the importance of coordinating the efforts of all parties including those of entrepreneurial universities in order to develop vaccines and generate healthcare solutions which could be patented and commercialized afterwards. Hence, this paper identifies the factors which can reinforce the entrepreneurial insertion of universities and increase their capacity in supporting collective efforts aiming at combatting the COVID-19 aftermath. Idea: Based on a review of recent literature, the purpose of this conceptual study is twofold: identify the predictors and the success factors of academic entrepreneurship; and argue for research propositions that could guide future empirical research. In addition, this paper provides insights into the current evolution of the entrepreneurial experiences of Middle Eastern universities. Data: This explorative research was based on an extensive literature review of the core aspects relevant to academic entrepreneurship. Recent references published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals with the primary focus on the Middle East or other developing economies were targeted in order to build up the conceptual model revolving around nine research propositions. Tools: Selected references were reviewed and categorized around the mainstream themes identified by the authors, i.e., impact of entrepreneurial universities, antecedents of academic entrepreneurship, and its success factors. For each block, several research propositions were derived and presented. Findings: The literature review findings argue for the potential role that specific factors can play in promoting the entrepreneurial engagement of Middle Eastern universities, namely the national institutional framework, an easy access to funding sources, the existence of interrelations with local organizations and the quality of the university’s organizational infrastructure. The conceptual framework assumes also that the performance of entrepreneurial universities would depend on the number and quality of relationships with the industry, the support of venture capitalists and the intensity of their entrepreneurial and market orientations. Contribution: This research contributes essentially in underlining the growing importance of academic entrepreneurship and how it can be a rewarding choice for Middle Eastern policy makers.","2021","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-25 14:14:28","","55-66","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2578015914","","","Place: Belgrade Publisher: University of Belgrade, Faculty of organizational sciences","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/uq0tK?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=hEcwV6PxOS3cXoLnF7xEBm01UXY%3D","Innovation; Literature reviews; Entrepreneurship; University spin-off; University; Regional development; Internationalization; Success factors; COVID-19; Pandemics; Business And Economics--Management; Entrepreneurs; Coronaviruses; Middle East; Pandemic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impacts identified in the systematic literature review are classified into: (1) economic, (2) social, and (3) financial. The systematic literature review also indicates that the impact of collaborations can change the context and enhance the mechanisms of technology transfer. From a theoretical viewpoint, this work contributes to the structuring of a conceptual model for assessing the socioeconomic impacts of university–industry collaborations.

It is influenced by the observation that there is a need for more systematic scrutiny of micro-level processes to deepen our understanding of academic entrepreneurship (Balven et al., 2018; Wright and Phan, 2018). The study proposes to answer to ‘What are the drivers of academic entrepreneurial intentions?’ and ‘What are the emerging topics for future research?’Design/methodology/approachThe paper follows a Systematic Literature Review process (Tranfield et al., 2003) and adopts a four-step process format from previous literature reviews within the entrepreneurship context (Miller et al., 2018). From the results within Scopus and Web of Science databases, this research selected, evaluated, summarised and synthesised 66 relevant papers.FindingsThis study provides a factor-listed representation of the individual, organisational and institutional variables that should be considered in the strategies defined by the university. Moreover, the study concludes that the push factors behind the intentions are multiple, context-dependent, hierarchy-dependent, heterogeneous and, at the same time, dependent on each other and against each other. Lastly, the study contributes to academic entrepreneurship literature, especially entrepreneurial intention literature, which has recently received more researchers' attention.Originality/valueThe study corroborates that the individual factors, directly and indirectly via Theory of Planned Behaviour, strongly impact the academics' intentions. While the focus of the papers under review was an in-depth analysis of a selected group of factors, this SLR sought to compile the factors that were identified and provide a broader picture of all those factors to be considered by the university management. It contributes to the identification and clustering of the drivers that encourage academics to engage in knowledge valorisation activities, differentiating them by activity. For the practitioners, this list can be used by university managers, TTOs and department managers, and policymakers to guide questionnaires or interviews to analyse their academics' intentions and adequately support its academic engagement strategy. Lastly, this study also suggests worthwhile avenues for future research.","2020","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-26 14:58:31","","645-704","","5","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2461406192","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/4kpPJ?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=DlbBRC%2B8qb932Luge2sCAGUsfWc%3D","Research; Systematic review; Universities; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; Academic entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship; University spin-off; Entrepreneurial university; Knowledge; Literature review; Collaboration; Academic spin-off; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Business And Economics--Management; Colleges & universities; Entrepreneurs; Theory of planned behavior; Spinoffs; Literature Reviews; Qualitative research; Surveys & questionnaires; Keywords; Academy; Academics intention; Books; Educational Environment; Intention; Interviews; Patents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subject is relatively new, because the first papers in this topic are dated to 2009, and in fact it has only been in the last 3 years that the interest of researchers in this subject has increased. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this study is to analyze the state of research on the issue of the university ecosystem of academic entrepreneurship and to identify the main research trends related to this topic. Methods: The article was based on a systematic review of the literature (SLR), which included the selection of basic literature and selection of publications, mayor researchers, bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Findings & Value added: The results of the conducted research indicate that the study of the university ecosystem of academic entrepreneurship is still a new issue, poorly recognized in literature, without a solid methodological foundation and which may constitute a current and interesting research area. Our paper adds to existing research in four important ways. We provide a holistic review of university entrepreneurial ecosystem. We also identify the challenges identified in this area and suggest how they may be developed. Third, our results are also policyrelevant. For policy-makers, it is important to know whether academic engagement is driven by mechanisms existing in academic ecosystem or affected by factors that may not be activated by it.","2020-03","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-26 14:46:33","","117-133","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2399206761","","","Place: Torun Publisher: Nicolaus Copernicus University Press","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/xE2RG?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=fMYaLfwjtp8TfrwxrtEh%2BlLOo%2B4%3D","University research; Systematic review; Bibliometrics; Literature reviews; Entrepreneurship; University spin-off; Publications; Commercialization; Cooperation; Culture; Trends; Researchers; Entrepreneurs; Databases; Business And Economics; Research methodology; Keywords; Academy; Entrepreneurship ecosystem; Research university; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work enhances the existing body of literature and knowledge regarding collaboration and offers concrete steps to be taken for effective collaboration between universities and industries.Research MethodologyA literature review to study the best practices, impediments to collaboration and the various models proposed in the past for successful UIC was conducted. A workshop and focus-group meetings of practitioners and academic researchers was designed and organised to explore the current state of the university–industry engagement within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region and gather inputs regarding possible approaches to improve collaboration. The findings from the literature review and the results from this qualitative research regarding the approaches to improve the effectiveness of the collaboration were analysed.Results and implicationsThe study discovers that various measures have been proposed in the form of best practices or models to improve the effectiveness of UIC. However, these measures often address a specific concern such as technology transfer, intellectual property (IP), etc. There is a scope for a comprehensive holistic framework to address many aspects of UIC in order to improve effectiveness and achieve success. A framework for improving the effectiveness of collaboration considering a comprehensive list of factors operating in a broad context within the collaboration system was proposed.Originality/valueThe framework builds on previous literature dealing with measures for successful UIC. However, it is the first of its kind, in the researcher's knowledge, in terms of comprehensiveness of the factors contributing to establishing and sustaining successful collaboration. The value of the individual experience of the participants in this qualitative research, which is on average more than 10 years in the software engineering field, validates the importance and quality of the data collected. The addition of these results to the framework increases its validity.The framework can be utilised by universities and industry practitioners to foster successful and effective collaboration. The results have significant relevance, particularly within the Australian context as the government has intensified the adoption of measures to encourage and improve collaboration between universities and the industry.","2020","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-25 14:14:28","","49-62","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2506877030","","","Place: Bingley Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/B1xPJ?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=izoh5IKx%2Fo6k9J0EZYIa7%2FajKJE%3D","Research; Technology transfer; Intellectual property; Collaboration; University; Data collection; Software engineering; University–industry collaboration; UIC; Framework; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Colleges & universities; Success; Education--Higher Education; Best practice; Effectiveness; Focus groups; Meetings; Practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The responsiveness of universities to such pressures and uncertainties is diverse. There are dozens of research identifying current best quality management practices. However, this paper makes an emphasis on the analysis of one of the streams of economic science—institutionalism as an innovative approach to effective internal management in HEIs. Institutionalism is a direction in economic thought that places the main emphasis on the analysis of institutions, which is defined as norms, restrictions and principles of behaviour (“rules of the game”) within an organization. In general, institutionalism is so diverse that its study as a whole is almost meaningless because there are different trends in institutionalism itself. Some prefer isomorphic elements of new institutionalism, whereas other stress on processes of differentiation between universities. Nevertheless, despite a growing tendency of an isomorphic strategy of successful universities and effective organizational strategies, there is a lack of research conducted on the application of elements of institutionalism in higher education, as a successful approach to effective internal quality management. The central idea of this paper is to analyze the existing body of literature related to the application of institutionalism in higher education through systematic literature review.","2020-01","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-25 14:14:28","","","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2485460351","","","Place: Abingdon Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/CCrPJ?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=kbHePrxE5KsQXZ0lpcTgJzJmC%2Fo%3D","Systematic review; higher education; Innovation; literature review; Literature reviews; Higher education; Business And Economics--Management; institutional theory; institutionalism; Institutionalism; organizational change; quality management; Quality management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finally, 150 papers published in a variety of academic journals specializing in the field of Entrepreneurship, KM and Higher Education were analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis to minimize mistakes in interpreting findings of collected studies.FindingsKM within entrepreneurial university is a research area of growing importance. Findings show that literature on KM models and tools in the entrepreneurial university is fragmented and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis shows heterogeneous literature, but four major research streams emerge: knowledge transfer in university–industry collaboration; knowledge creation in entrepreneurship education; KM processes for university spin-offs; entrepreneurial university to support knowledge-based regional development. The results show a failure to address the implications of findings for policy makers, which risks making KM in entrepreneurial universities research irrelevant.Research limitations/implicationsAlthough different structured literature reviews (SLRs) exist separately in the field of KM and entrepreneurial universities, to the authors’ best knowledge, no studies exist in the intersection between the two fields.Originality/valueThe paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive SLR of the articles dealing with models and processes of KM in the entrepreneurial university. Despite the increasing literature, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized, thus requiring more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the economic and the social aspects of KM within universities. The paper’s findings can offer insights into future research avenues.","2019","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-25 14:14:28","","3226-3257","","12","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2316760552","","","Place: London Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/eClOJ?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=TKwtR2jvG8H5bp2D7QbVJIQKu5Y%3D","Research; Technology transfer; Systematic review; Knowledge management; Bibliometrics; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; Education; Entrepreneurship; Collaboration; University; Third mission; Entrepreneurial universities; Spin-offs; Trends; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Business And Economics--Management; Colleges & universities; Entrepreneurs; Content analysis; Small & medium sized enterprises-SME; Spinoffs; Public sector; Structured literature review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, today as it stands, universities the world over are in a dynamic state and they are forced to transform to meet the ever-changing needs of development and growth. This is due in part from educating the next generation who can make their place and compete in the globalized world. Thus, universities in emerging economies are now moving towards becoming ‘entrepreneurial universities' to meet the changing demand and challenges. Thus, by adopting a qualitative approach with an in-depth literature review, the aim of this paper, to understand the need, role, and significance of the entrepreneurial university, and provide a holistic framework for an entrepreneurial university and to identify the critical success factors that make a university truly entrepreneurial in the context of emerging economies.","2019","2025-07-25 14:14:28","2025-07-25 14:14:28","","46-61","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2904648882","","","Place: Gualtar Publisher: IGI Global","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/sq8mW?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=HIr8jsOiwICyZwwV3%2FbQxV3sMRw%3D","Literature reviews; Entrepreneurship; Critical success factor; University; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Business And Economics--Management; Colleges & universities; Qualitative research; Globalization; Emerging markets; Emerging market","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although these roles vary from one country to another, effective patenting and licensing procedures, as well as eventual commercialisation of scholarly inventions, reflect hard work on the part of the University mediating between the researcher and the industry through technology transfer offices (TTOs) in order to ensure that knowledge-developers take motivational and monetary credit for their findings. This paper details some existing models, processes, and roles taken up in some countries where sharing of intellectual property exists, and links it up with aspects of university–industry technology transfer, such as policies surrounding patenting, government investment and marketing, and the process of academic entrepreneurship, among others. 22 articles were found via a systematic review of literature and analysed with respect to four identified areas of focus: internal strategy, investment and market, academic entrepreneurship and policy. Based on models, processes, and roles in reviewed studies, our results indicate that new models for technology transfer mainly stem from the fact that there is no universally accepted model in the literature. Furthermore, management of technology transfer is mostly the responsibility of TTOs in most countries. While university TTOs act as intermediaries to protect the interest of the author/inventor, issues such as poor relationships between universities and industry, as well as funding, remain major challenges in many emerging economies. In contrast, researchers in western economies are mainly challenged by financial motivation and recognition within the academic domains.","2019","2025-07-25 14:14:29","2025-07-26 14:49:44","","67","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2545535905","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/6F0pJ?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=qq3IaT5PLKE7I33JYahq0aXOAbg%3D","Technology transfer; Systematic review; Innovation; management; Entrepreneurship; University spin-off; Knowledge; systematic review; University; Patent; universities; Researchers; Business And Economics--Management; Entrepreneurs; Research & development--R&D; United States--US; commercialisation; technology transfer models; TECHNOLOGY transfer; META-analysis; Lessors of Nonfinancial Intangible Assets (except Copyrighted Works); PATENT licenses; Public Finance Activities; PUBLIC investments; TECHNOLOGY management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, this paper analyzes how knowledge management and transfer within arts and crafts organizations help increase performance and enhance the value of the activity of the so-called “knowledge workers” (i.e. craftsmen), who are the real knowledge owners in the process of value creation.Design/methodology/approachThe literature review follows the model suggested by Vom Brocke et al. (2009). The review follows a five-phase approach so as to be systematic, transparent and replicable. Academic contributions published over two periods are taken into consideration. The first period covers the years 1990-2000, when the concepts of creative industry and knowledge-based economy were developed. The second period covers the years 2000-2016, when scholars started to investigate how to effectively transfer knowledge (very often in the form of “tacit knowledge”) retained by master craftsmen in arts and crafts organizations and the critical role played by craftsmen in the performance of such organizations.FindingsThree main issues have emerged: how arts and crafts organizations manage and transfer knowledge internally; the effects of these activities on organizational performance; and the prominent role of craftsmen. The literature review shows how in arts and crafts organizations there is a considerable link between the concepts of “performance"" and ""tacit knowledge"", even though addressing such link is somehow hard to realize, for several reasons discussed in the paper. The measurement of performance in arts and crafts organizations has become an area of academic investigation only when both the role of knowledge management and transfer and the role of knowledge workers (i.e., craftsmen) have become evident for obtaining a competitive advantage.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper has been an attempt to organize existing studies on knowledge management and transfer and to investigate the relationship existing between knowledge and performance in arts and crafts organizations. Nevertheless, the relationship between knowledge and performance is yet to be explored, as well as the development of techniques for measuring arts and crafts organizations’ performance effectively. The present contribution calls for a systematic reflection on how the transfer of traditional craftsmen’s skills impacts organizational performances in the long run. The definition and implementation of new performance evaluations criteria tailored to enhance the tacit knowledge of craftsmen as a real source of differentiation and competitive advantage for the arts and crafts organizations is somehow still missing.Practical implicationsBy pursuing its objectives, the present contribution aims to represent a step toward enabling arts and crafts organizations to play a vital role in the modern society in a more structured way. This would help to build awareness of the potential of arts and crafts organizations for promoting economic growth, proposing a value proposition different from the one dictated by the globalization and by the triumph of product standardization and mass production.Originality/valueAnalyzing the knowledge management and transfer within arts and crafts organizations with a historical perspective, it appears that the recognition in academic literature of the centrality of knowledge management and transfer within arts and crafts organizations is only recent (i.e. from 2011 onward). Indeed, for approximately 20 years (i.e. 1990-2010), knowledge has been constantly related to technological paradigms and standardized results, with very little research and debate on craftsmanship and the role of craftsmen. Nevertheless, the research shows that over the years, the focus on knowledge in arts and crafts organizations and knowledge transfer has become progressively more detailed and precise: some authors have studied the role of craftsmen in the knowledge economy according to a historical perspective, while some others have analyzed different types of knowledge more thoroughly. For example, Sveiby (1997, 1996), analyzing the concept of ""knowing talent"" and ""tradition"", outlines a more prominent role of craftsmen in the knowledge economy and explain how, in sectors with a strong traditional background, the transfer of tacit knowledge is a meaningful challenge for many organizations.","2018","2025-07-25 14:14:29","2025-07-25 14:14:29","","1310-1331","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2067093492","","","Place: Kempston Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/GxvPJ?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=gU8rj%2B4BOUqAwM72aeGyvVzIjN8%3D","Economics; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; Knowledge economy; Standardization; Knowledge; Economic development; Competitive advantage; Organizations; Tacit knowledge; Business And Economics--Management; Skills; Corporate culture; Globalization; International markets; Albinism; Artisans; Arts; Arts and crafts organizations; Automation; Business competition; Crafts; Craftsmen; Creative industries; Creative industry; Explicit knowledge; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Mass production; Organizational performance; Task forces; Traditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this sense, universities play a crucial role in this mission, and university spin-offs have become one of the most popular mechanisms of academic knowledge transfer. The purpose of this paper is to perform a literature review in the field of university spin-offs. The adopted methodology starts by creating a conceptual map of the various research areas around university spin-offs, followed by the identification of the most predominant studies in the field taking into account the number of citations. The findings indicate that the main explored dimensions in the university spin-offs research include the process of technology transfer, the role of university in the society, the regional context of the university and the impact of university spin-offs considering several dimensions. On the other side the least explored dimensions include the analysis of the founders' background, and the establishment of public policies to support the activities of university spin-offs.","2018-06","2025-07-25 14:14:29","2025-07-26 14:41:16","","27-40","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2059077646","","","Place: Bucharest Publisher: Academia de Studii Economice din Bucuresti, Research Center in Public Administration and Public Management","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/w9Fw5?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=M8V5EZ3gUArDn6%2B0s6Z8BIwLC%2Fg%3D","Technology transfer; Knowledge transfer; Literature reviews; Entrepreneurship; Intellectual property; Public policy; Higher education; Knowledge; Literature review; University; Venture capital; Business And Economics--Management; Entrepreneurs; Research & development--R&D; Society; United Kingdom--UK; Studies; Citation; KNOWLEDGE transfer; TECHNOLOGY transfer; TECHNOLOGICAL innovations; ACADEMIC spin-outs; ECONOMIC development; GOVERNMENT policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasingly, universities have been required to provide performance indicators—empirical evidence of their value creation — to the different group of stakeholders. One of the approaches that may be applied by universities is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The objective of this paper is to indicate the BSC as a useful tool for the evaluation of the universities’ performance.Methodology: This study is based on the following research methods: descriptive, deductive, and the literature review. It refers also to case studies that are quoted in the context of their practical BSC application experience and it presents the pioneer approach of California University in BSC adoption. The rationale of this paper follows the principal-agent theory that is a foundation of the accountability concept. It refers also to the new managerialism, new public management, and entrepreneurial university.Findings: Based on the literature review concerning the analysis of the examples of universities implementing BSC, this paper argues that BSC provides a framework for the performance measurement that allows for the increased transparency and accountability of these institutions.Value added: The pioneer BSC framework presented in this paper can be used as the basis for the development of general performance measurement in universities.Recommendations: It is recommended that the universities that want to boost their transparency and be accountable for their outcomes apply and develop the BSC framework to which we refer to in this paper.","2018","2025-07-25 14:14:29","2025-07-25 14:14:29","","57-83","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","3156319061","","","Place: Łódź Publisher: De Gruyter Poland","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/cvdFb?_a=ChgyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo3MTM2OTcSBzEyODMyODkaCk9ORV9TRUFSQ0giDzExMS4xMjUuMjA4LjI0NyoHNjc3NTU2OTIKMzE1NjMxOTA2MToNRG9jdW1lbnRJbWFnZUIBMFIGT25saW5lWgJGVGIDUEZUagoyMDE4LzAxLzAxcgoyMDE4LzEyLzMxegCCASpQLTEwMDAwMDEtMTg1MjkwLUNVU1RPTUVSLTEwMDAwMDA4LTQ4OTMwMTWSAQZPbmxpbmXKAW9Nb3ppbGxhLzUuMCAoV2luZG93cyBOVCAxMC4wOyBXaW42NDsgeDY0KSBBcHBsZVdlYktpdC81MzcuMzYgKEtIVE1MLCBsaWtlIEdlY2tvKSBDaHJvbWUvMTM4LjAuMC4wIFNhZmFyaS81MzcuMzbSARJTY2hvbGFybHkgSm91cm5hbHOaAgdQcmVQYWlkqgIrT1M6RU1TLU1lZGlhTGlua3NTZXJ2aWNlLWdldE1lZGlhVXJsRm9ySXRlbcoCD0FydGljbGV8RmVhdHVyZdICAVnyAgD6AgFZggMDV2ViigMcQ0lEOjIwMjUwNzI1MTM0NjQ1NTU4OjQxMTA5NQ%3D%3D&_s=xj7OX9lJczF74Dcl7uB0iwzyQNc%3D","Performance evaluation; Accountability; universities; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Business And Economics--Management; Colleges & universities; balanced scorecard; Balanced Scorecard; performance measurement; Transparency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To be comprehensive, uniquely this review considers the relevant journal articles in both English and Chinese languages. The major themes and methodologies used by authors are identified. The evolution of the literature, particularly those in Chinese from general discussions often with minimal citations to more empirically rigorous studies is documented. It is also shown that the English and Chinese language literatures have little overlap in terms of citations, thereby indicating that the two research communities are still largely disconnected. It is found that the sources of data have remained quite limited and the quantitative research is based almost entirely upon government statistics collected for administrative purpose. The concluding discussion suggests possible avenues for future progress in terms of developing new data sources and increasing the cross-fertilization of two research communities.","2016-10","2025-07-25 14:14:29","2025-07-25 14:14:29","","891-929","","5","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1818626014","","","Place: Indianapolis Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/InlCS?_a=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&_s=2Qqkuizpv7gi%2Bg4eaeTqMTB0rTQ%3D","Research; Technology transfer; University research; China; Universities; Literature reviews; Higher education; Literature review; Economic development; University; Meta-analysis; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Colleges & universities; Technology: Comprehensive Works; Developing countries--LDCs; Research & development--R&D; Society; Studies; 54171:Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; Research centers; O3; 81394:Political Organizations; Chinese; Chinese literature; Cultural Revolution; English; English language; O1; O2; P2; Political parties; Research & development expenditures; Taxonomy; University-industry linkages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is based on a survey of articles published in major national journals or presented at the most relevant Brazilian and regional conferences, between 1980 and 2012. The year 1980 was chosen due to the creation of the Technological Innovation Offices (NITs), which was the first government initiative to encourage knowledge transfer from universities to companies; the second was the Innovation Act of 2004. Our assumption was that after the Act the number of academic papers on this subject would increase, bringing new ideas and propositions of models to enhance this relationship. The methodology employed a qualitative, exploratory approach, using bibliographical research and a bibliometric analysis of 247 papers. Literature review of international studies shows the discussion of problems and suggestions for improvements, while in Brazil there is still a debate on whether this collaboration should occur, and if this is a legitimate role for the university. Despite the numerical growth, the content analysis showed few papers on new configurations and procedures for partnership management. We conclude that university-industry relations are not a regular and totally accepted process in Brazilian public universities, which reflect an ideological bias against cooperation with firms.","2016-03","2025-07-25 14:14:29","2025-07-25 14:14:29","","72-86","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1785376050","","","Place: São Paulo Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/O5K7S?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=ZQYTX%2Bo8GnYtBaVCPYQM5yJeSc8%3D","Multinational corporations; Bibliometrics; Intellectual property; Entrepreneurship education; Collaboration; University; Brazil; Technological change; Cooperation; Business And Economics--Management; Entrepreneurs; Content analysis; Research & development--R&D; Studies; 54171:Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; Research centers; 8306:Schools and educational services; 9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment; 9173:Latin America; 9520:Small business; Sector; Tax incentives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained by an online survey of MBA students enrolled in at four US graduate business schools. These were a public and private institution in the Northeast region, a private sectarian institution in the Midwest region and a private institution in the Pacific region. All students worked while attending the university. The sampling frame consisted of each school’s MBA enrollees. Questionnaires were distributed to a random cross-section of part-time students at each graduate school of business representative of returned by 144 students. The profiles of responders were consistent with parameters for the entire MBA student population. Findings – The research shows that multiple goals of reciprocal knowledge and skills transfer may be in harmony and mutually reinforcing. In principle, each goal is more likely to be attained with greater economy of effort than might be surmised. Additionally, the same forces may act similarly to facilitate attainment of two well-integrated goals, in this case transfer between MBA studies and work, as well as between work and MBA studies. Research limitations/implications – The present study involved participants from part-time public and private MBA granting institutions in the USA. The study tested and extended goal-setting theory and introduced the innovative concept of reciprocal transfer. Future studies should seek to generalize the findings to a broader population of part-time MBA students, especially from other nations. Despite its strengths, the findings of this study need to be interpreted in the perspective of some limitations. The current study did not measure transfer climates in either the organization or university settings. Transfer climates undoubtedly have an important bearing on transfer outcomes. Practical implications – Review of the present study suggests that a positive MBA environment is needed to influence motivation to learn and perceptions of the MBA program’s utility, thereby promoting transfer of knowledge and skills to MBA studies from the workplace. A supportive work-to-MBA-studies transfer climate will lead to more active learning of course content that has greater relevance for achieving career goals. Potentially generalizable from the organizational transfer climate literature (Rouiller and Goldstein 1990; Rouiller and Goldstein 1993), positive transfer from work to MBA studies will occur when appropriate situational cues and consequences are present in the program. Social implications – A constructive implication suggested by the findings of this study would be the intervention and transfer management by educators to structure and strengthen the university transfer climate of their part-time MBA programs. Traditionally, the concept of transfer climate has been primarily applied to employee workplace training activity and job performance. The university culture of the MBA student might emphasize and reward continuous learning from workplace experiences. Opportunities at the university should be provided for the exercise of newly acquired workplace skills that reinforce MBA learning experiences. Originality/value – This is the first study that shows how learning goals and performance goals are integrated in the context of a new concept, i.e. reciprocal transfer of knowledge and skills between MBA and workplace settings. It also demonstrates, for the first time, the impact of learning and motivation for MBA studies and perceived utility of MBA program on the extent of transfer of learning and skills from the workplace to the university setting.","2015","2025-07-25 14:14:29","2025-07-25 14:14:29","","207-225","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2250599363","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/LN61A?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=BLUdqccYhBVlVSCXtu%2BN1N502SU%3D","Knowledge transfer; Knowledge; Theory; Motivation; Performance; Management education; Careers; Skills; Qualitative research; United States--US; Business Education; Surveys & questionnaires; Hypotheses; Business administration; Interviews; Studies; Meta Analysis; Self Efficacy; Academic Achievement; Business And Economics--Personnel Management; Business education; Change Strategies; Educational objectives; Goal Orientation; Goal setting; Graduate students; Individual Characteristics; Job Performance; Learning Motivation; Learning orientation; Locus of Control; Master of Business Administration; MBA programs & graduates; On-the-job training; Part Time Students; Skill; Skill Development; Student Motivation; Transfer of Training; Workplace; Workplace Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge transfer from university to industry is supported by national governments as part of their innovation, national growth and competitiveness agenda. A university-industry landscape involves multiple stakeholders with multiple, and often contradicting, objectives and organizational mind-set and cultures. The paper is based on a systematic literature review of the effectiveness of university-industry collaborations from a holistic perspective in order to identify drivers and barriers to a fruitful collaboration. A dedicated section explores knowledge transfer in the emerging market context to provide an international dimension to a growing international trend in university-industry collaboration. The key findings on success factors relate to organizational and individual contexts, knowledge attributes and relational aspects. The literature research findings are further tested through a survey of key stakeholders: university managers, researchers, industry managers and government representatives, revealing differences in perception among various stakeholders' groups. The paper provides an insight into drivers and potential barriers in university-industry collaborations. The findings enable developing a practical framework for the universities to support their decision-making process. The framework can be used a support tool for evaluating university-industry collaborations both generally and in the international context.

We provide a critical overview of the literature on research collaboration, focusing particularly on individual-level collaborations among university researchers, but we also give attention to university researchers' collaborations with researchers in other sectors, including industry. We consider collaborations aimed chiefly at expanding the base of knowledge (knowledge-focused collaborations) as well as ones focused on production of economic value and wealth (property-focused collaborations), the latter including most academic entrepreneurship research collaborations. To help organize our review we develop a framework for analysis, one that considers attributes of collaborators, collaborative process and organization characteristics as the affect collaboration choices and outcomes. In addition, we develop and use a ""Propositional Table for Research Collaboration Literature,"" presented as an ""Appendix"" to this study. We conclude with some suggestions for possible improvement in research on collaboration including: (1) more attention to multiple levels of analysis and the interactions among them; (2) more careful measurement of impacts as opposed to outputs; (3) more studies on 'malpractice' in collaboration, including exploitation; (4) increased attention to collaborators' motives and the social psychology of collaborative teams.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","2013-02","2025-07-25 14:14:30","2025-07-25 14:14:30","","1-67","","1","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1267230072","","","Place: Indianapolis Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/7XzeU?_a=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&_s=c1KaQ9UULaHpMnTgegCZhRDoNE4%3D","Research; Technology transfer; Knowledge management; Entrepreneurship; University spin-off; Knowledge; Collaboration; University; Analysis; Productivity; Entrepreneurs; Technology: Comprehensive Works; Human capital; Developing countries--LDCs; Research & development--R&D; Studies; Academic achievement; 5200:Communications & information management; 8306:Schools and educational services; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 9520:Small business; 2600:Management science/operations research; 5400:Research & development; Capitalism; Co authorship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings - The areas of knowledge management implementation, knowledge management perception, and knowledge transfer are relatively well researched topics; whereas those of knowledge identification, knowledge storage/retention and knowledge utilisation are poorly understood. Given the prevalence of small and medium-sized enterprises there is a strong need for more research on this important topic. The future research directions proposed by the authors may help to develop a greater understanding of knowledge management in small and medium-sized enterprises.

Design/methodology/approach - An extensive literature review was conducted, focusing on current studies concerning the OI concept and research lines, OI and universities, KTE, and the factors affecting researcher engagement in university KTE. Based on this review a conceptual framework was proposed, including four main factors that affect KTE researcher engagement (personal and professional, institutional, social networks and recognition). The assumptions of this framework were explored in an empirical study involving 382 senior researchers, acting as leaders of different research groups, at Spanish universities. This was followed by univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Findings - Results show that, apart from recognition, most of the proposed factors affect researcher engagement in KTE processes. The social network factors appear to be the most important, as all items were significant in affecting the engagement of researchers in these processes. Research limitations/implications - Both the study and the statistical analysis are exploratory, therefore results should be treated with caution. Moreover, the data were collected from only one country, hence, in order to improve validity, additional data would be needed. Practical implications - Social networks (between researchers, businesses, university administrators, University Technology Transfer Office directors, etc.) should be promoted in order to improve researcher involvement in university KTE in an OI context. Originality/value - There is a lack of research literature discussing factors affecting researcher engagement in KTE processes. Moreover, researcher involvement is a key factor in contributing to the success of KTE. This paper provides a thorough discussion of these factors and proposes a conceptual framework with which they may be studied in the context of OI.","2012","2025-07-25 14:14:30","2025-07-25 14:14:30","","417-439","","4","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1019286076","","","Place: Bradford Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/NUrVU?_a=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&_s=dnz2xWBm%2FiMOv2ENG3jMc3X5o1E%3D","Innovation; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Intellectual property; Knowledge; University; Open innovation; Technological change; Researchers; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Colleges & universities; Innovations; Research & development--R&D; Studies; Pharmaceutical industry; Business And Economics--Small Business; 5200:Communications & information management; 8306:Schools and educational services; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 32541:Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing; Open; Open source software; Recognition; Social network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a literature review, an exploratory framework - building on three perspectives - is proposed about the conditions in which employee-oriented corporate social responsibility (CSR) affects long-term firm performance positively. First, the stakeholder view on CSR entails that employees can be considered as legitimate stakeholders of the firm justifying introduction of employee-oriented CSR. Second, the human resource management perspective matters as employee-oriented CSR materialises in human resource management policies and practices that increase employee commitment. Finally, as regulative, normative and cognitive institutions differ across countries, the institutionalist perspective is relevant to understand diverging demands on content and form of employee-oriented CSR practices. Findings - It is argued that owner-managers of (multinational) SMEs, who view their employees as legitimate stakeholders of the firm, will introduce employee-oriented CSR out of their sense of moral responsibility towards their employees. This sense of moral responsibility is conditional on achieving sustainable mutual value creation as a result of employee-oriented CSR. Finally, transfer of employee-oriented CSR to foreign subsidiaries is positively mediated by the level of owner-managers' institutional entrepreneurship. Originality/value - This is one of the few studies addressing the position of employees as internal stakeholders of small and medium-sized enterprises in an international context. It signals the relevance of institutional differences across countries to entrepreneurs who wish to improve long-term firm performance through employee-oriented CSR.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","2011","2025-07-25 14:14:30","2025-07-25 14:14:30","","123-139","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","873623731","","","Place: Bingley Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/OBJ/Pk9KU?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=K2V02mlsCqqrym6Q7CXvRVtSoGc%3D","Multinational corporations; Literature reviews; Human resource management; Theory; Europe; Social responsibility; Stakeholders; Business And Economics--Management; Small & medium sized enterprises-SME; Economic; Globalization; Small business; Studies; Institutionalism; Employees; 9130:Experimental/theoretical; 2410:Social responsibility; 9175:Western Europe; 9520:Small business; Small and medium-sized enterprises; 6100:Human resource planning; 9176:Eastern Europe; 9510:Multinational corporations; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Moral responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YBUJEA9X","journalArticle","2021","Milligan, Crystal; Whitney, Berta","Reimagining community relationships for organizational learning: a scoping review with implications for a learning health system","BMC Health Services Research","","","10.1186/s12913-021-06640-9","https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/reimagining-community-relationships/docview/2553296623/se-2?accountid=185290","Background  Communities represent a highly relevant source of knowledge with regard to not only healthcare performance but also sociocultural context, yet their role in learning health systems has not been studied. Situating the learning health system as an organization, this paper explores the phenomenon of organizational learning from or with communities (defined as one of ‘the people,’ such as a town, a specific patient group or another group directly receiving a healthcare service). Methods We conducted a scoping review to determine what is known about organizational learning from or with communities that the organization serves, and to contribute to a more comprehensive evidence base for building and operating learning health systems. In March 2019, we systematically searched six academic databases and grey literature, applying no date limits, for English language materials that described organizational learning in relation to knowledge transfer between an organization and a community. Numerous variables were charted in Excel and synthesized using frequencies and thematic analysis. We updated this search in August 2020. Results In total, 42 documents were included in our analysis. We found a disproportionate emphasis on learning explicit knowledge from community rather than on tacit knowledge or learning in equal partnership with community. Our review also revealed inconsistently defined concepts, tenuously linked with their theoretical and empirical foundations. Our findings provide insight to understand the organization-community learning relationship, including motives and power differentials; types of knowledge to be learned; structures and processes for learning; and transformative learning outcomes. Conclusions Our review makes a singular contribution to organizational learning literatures by drawing from diverse research disciplines such as health services, business and education to map what is known about learning from or with community. Broadly speaking, learning health systems literature would benefit from additional research and theory-building within a sociological paradigm so as to establish key concepts and associations to understand the nature of learning with community, as well as the practices that make it happen.","2021","2025-07-25 14:20:05","2025-07-25 14:20:05","","1-10","","","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","2553296623","","","Place: London Publisher: BioMed Central","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/EmXxJ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=KFNphcle4NJuowvTc0jZZfl%2BJKw%3D","Systematic review; Knowledge transfer; Organizational learning; Community; Health services; Tacit knowledge; Health system; Explicit knowledge; Search strategies; Grey literature; Learning health system; Learning health systems; Learning organization; Medical Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has resulted in University Technology Transfer (UTT) taking place within an increasingly complex network of regional stakeholders. This complexity has resulted in quadruple helix models where the triple helix model of academia, industry and regional government now includes societal based innovation users as a fourth helix. Despite this development, extant research is fragmented and lacks coherent frameworks and conceptualisations which fully depict the dynamic and evolving nature of UTT. Accordingly, this article reviews Mode 2 UTT from a quadruple helix perspective to identify key themes to develop a research agenda which reflects progression from a triple into a quadruple helix ecosystem.","2018-01","2025-07-25 14:20:05","2025-07-26 15:08:40","","7-24","","1","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1980826834","","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","","Research; Technology transfer; Systematic review; Universities; Technology; Economic development; University; Triple helix; 61131:Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Business And Economics--Management; Colleges & universities; TECHNOLOGY transfer; ACADEMIC-industrial collaboration; and Professional Schools; colleges; Colleges; UNIVERSITIES &amp; ECONOMIC development; SOCIAL development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our hospital-based HTA unit is now part of a large network comprising 100 installations. To bridge the gap between complex HTAs and even more limited time by executive officers and managers, we needed to develop a new approach to deliver effectively key HTA messages. We initiated a new strategy with a report on drug-eluting stent (DES). DES may have the potential to eradicate restenosis and the necessity to perform multiple revascularization procedures subsequent to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the technology is expensive and some concerns about safety remain. The second generation of DES stents show promising results in terms of efficacy and safety.METHODS:We conducted a systematic review of meta-analyses comparing bare-metal stents (BMS) with second generation DES. Data extracted were used to perform a cost-benefit analysis for our organization. Main findings were illustrated in relation to the strategic plan of our institution.RESULTS:As compared to BMS, the second generation of DES is very effective and potentially leads to huge savings. Safety is improved as regard to myocardial infarction, but not to mortality. For our institution, the use of second-generation DES has the potential to reduce waiting lists for a PCI. In an effort to improve clarity of the results and increase knowledge transfer among managers, we developed a new communication strategy involving the six axes considered as strategic by our Chief Executive Officer, namely: university mission, judicious use of resources, accessibility and quality of care and services, to build for and with the staff, and to act for and with the patient and his family. This led to a smart visual scheme directly showing the results in terms of what is important for our hospital. This initiative was very appreciated by managers.CONCLUSIONS:Using our institutional strategic plan to communicate our results allowed a greater visibility of HTA activities and was greatly appreciated by managers. This will help in disseminating our results locally and in promoting the utility of HTA.","2017","2025-07-25 14:20:05","2025-07-25 14:20:05","","142-143","","","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1986598066","","","Place: Cambridge Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/GfLB4?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI1MDcyNTEzNDY0NTU1ODo0MTEwOTU%3D&_s=OnV81%2FvisjT1SI999aRSKBWN6lY%3D","Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Health technology; Cost benefit analysis; Aerospace technology transfer; Drug delivery; Drug-eluting stent; Health technology assessment; Hospital; Implants; Medical Sciences--Experimental Medicine, Laboratory Technique; Myocardial infarction; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Restenosis; Safety; Stents; Surgical implants; Technology assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do this, after a literature review and using qualitative methodology, ten semi-structured interviews with teachers at the Technical University of Oruro (UTO) and managers of small and medium enterprises in the Department of Oruro (Bolivia) were conducted. The main results show that these activities are still very incipient in the region, so their impact on regional development is low. In conclusion, this study establishes that the determinants for TT activities between the UTO and the business sector can be divided into opportunities and barriers. Among the opportunities for the UTO, internal improvements and a more proactive role in society stand out. For the companies, the opportunities are improved productivity and competitiveness. On the other hand, the barriers to TT are bureaucratic, lack of funding, lack of confidence and lack of professionalism. Therefore, it is very important that a clear policy be established to regulate technology transfer activities.","2014","2025-07-25 14:20:06","2025-07-25 14:20:06","","387","","67","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","ABI/INFORM Collection","1632357941","","","Place: Maracaibo","","","","Technology transfer; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; University; Open innovation; Regional development; Competitive advantage; Business; Business And Economics--Management; Small & medium sized enterprises-SME; Area planning & development; Educational partnerships; 5200:Communications & information management; 8306:Schools and educational services; 9130:Experiment/theoretical treatment; 9173:Latin America; 1200:Social policy; Bolivia; Bureaucracy; Oruro Bolivia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The core objective is to discover sources of actionable knowledge and to decipher its optimum dissemination among management students, encompassing technical, conceptual and human skill development, through interaction with both theory and practice, in order to prepare students for active participation, and potential leadership, in the business environment. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we propose a participatory leader knowledge dissemination model, where business leaders can stimulate the academic environment, and leadership skill development can be promoted through practitioners' active involvement in the education process. The article concludes with a perspective on the evolution of knowledge transfer among management students and the current trend towards dynamic collaboration between academics and corporate leaders.

Policy reuse and other multi-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn multiple tasks but may generate many policies. This paper presents two novel contributions, namely 1) Lifetime Policy Reuse, a model-agnostic policy reuse algorithm that avoids generating many policies by optimising a fixed number of near-optimal policies through a combination of policy optimisation and adaptive policy selection; and 2) the task capacity, a measure for the maximal number of tasks that a policy can accurately solve. Comparing two state-of-the-art base-learners, the results demonstrate the importance of Lifetime Policy Reuse and task capacity based pre-selection on an 18-task partially observable Pacman domain and a Cartpole domain of up to 125 tasks.","2024","2025-07-25 14:52:04","2025-07-25 14:52:04","","115-148","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","KNOWLEDGE transfer; ARTIFICIAL intelligence; REINFORCEMENT learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With a separate auxiliary dataset, EDFL integrates Fisher discriminative learning and domain adaptation into a unified framework. The separate auxiliary dataset and the gallery/probe dataset are from two different domains (named source and target domains respectively) and have different data distributions. EDFL is modeled to transfer the discriminative knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain for classification. Since the gallery set with SSPP contains scarce number of samples, it is hard to accurately represent the data distribution of the target domain, which hinders the adaptation effect. To overcome this problem, the generalized domain adaption (GDA) method is proposed to realize good overall domain adaptation when one domain contains limited samples.

Nowadays, corporate entrepreneurship (CE) is perceived as an essential approach to boost the innovation and creativity within existing organizations for achieving higher opportunities in the market. This paper examines this concept, which has been largely discussed in the Anglo-Saxon world over the last thirty years. Like for many other phenomena, also in case of CE, this discussion has provided numerous conceptualizations, and consequently, there is not one unique definition of CE. In this respect, the search for an appropriate basis for understanding and describing the phenomenon of CE engenders a challenging issue for entrepreneurship researchers. Research aims. This paper aims at creating a large platform for understanding the concept of CE by means of a clarification effort through the review of the most important papers in this field and identification of the existing research gaps.

The complex nature of 'employee entrepreneurial behavior' suggests that a myriad of contextual influences act on the emergence of such behavior. It is imperative that theorists and practitioners alike understand both the subtle and sophisticated ways in which context influences employee entrepreneurial behavior. To address these issues and encourage future work, this study performs a systematic literature review to provide an overview of the field and examines the influence of the job/role, organizational/work and external contexts on employee entrepreneurial behavior. Findings suggest that employee entrepreneurial behavior is an emergent research field and that its behaviors can manifest themselves in different ways compared to firm-level entrepreneurial behaviors.

In order to contribute towards overcoming this research gap, the purpose of this paper is to focus more closely on this issue, within the Italian context. Design/methodology/approach Theoretically based on the notion of institutional entrepreneurship, the paper analyses the ways in which trade unions contribute to the diffusion of LG-inclusive policies. Empirically this study is based on qualitative interviews with representatives from the unions, LGBT activists and individuals from those companies that have received support from the unions in terms of shaping their initiatives. Findings Italian unions act as institutional entrepreneurs in the sexual orientation field by framing the issue of the inclusion of LGBT workers as an issue of including minority groups under the broad umbrella of equality in workplaces, and by cooperating with LGBT associations. The latter provides the unions with two different things. First, with more legitimacy, from the viewpoint of LGBT employees; second, with the specific competencies in dealing with these issues. The accomplishments of the unions consist of arranging single agreements concerning the establishment of “punishment systems” for discriminatory behaviours, rather than promoting inclusion-oriented behaviours within the organization. Originality/value This paper highlights the role of unions, and in doing so, focusses on a hitherto marginalized actor in the process of adapting LGBT diversity initiatives. In focussing on the Italian context, it adds an important perspective to a discourse that has previously consisted of predominantly Anglo-American views.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:05","2025-07-26 06:53:05","","477-490","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional entrepreneurship; Diversity management; Gay; Lesbian; LGBT; Unions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It aims to study in depth the use of sustainable innovation (SI) as a means of increasing legitimacy within the institutions, thus triggering an institutional change. Design/methodology/approach The paper opted for an exploratory study on the Tuscan geothermal heat pumps market, which presents a promising but still largely unexploited sustainability potential despite its low institutional support, using the open-ended approach of grounded theory. The data include interviews and archive data, such as newspapers, magazines. Findings The paper provides empirical insights on how sustainable institutional entrepreneurs (SIEs) have developed innovative business models based on direct relationship with the final customers and strategic partnerships as a means of increasing legitimacy within the normative and cultural-cognitive institutions, and subsequently in the regulative institutions, through: innovative value propositions aimed at changing industry norms and social beliefs; increasing the private benefit of innovative sustainable business models in order to trigger imitation dynamics; inter-sector strategic partnerships sharing the same sustainability objectives; the inclusion of the relevant actors in relation to the social norms and cultural-cognitive barriers in a value proposition. On the basis of these findings a model has been developed. Research limitations/implications The study enriches the sustainable entrepreneurship research stream by providing empirical evidence on how SEs foster changes in the three institutional pillars with SI. It also contributes to the institutional entrepreneurship research by extending the results of previous studies regarding institutional tactics. Practical implications The paper could help SIEs prioritizing changes in value propositions and strategic partnerships to create market-based coalitions, as a means of institutional legitimization for SI. Originality/value The study illustrates the relationship between the sustainable institutional entrepreneurial practices and each institutional pillar, including the cultural-cognitive institutions, which have been neglected in previous research.

The study exemplifies such locations by empirically exploring self-storage based businesses: that is, businesses that operate for a significant number of hours each week from self-storage facilities. Design/methodology/approach – The study draws on interviews with entrepreneurs operating self-storage based businesses and operators of self-storage facilities. The interview data is supported by site visits, businesses’ websites, promotional and marketing materials and press coverage. Findings – Consistent with the liminal lens, entrepreneurs view their time operating from self-storage as a transitional phase. They do not suffer the high levels of uncertainty and unsettledness usually associated with liminality. However, they experience anxiety related to perceptions of operating from a business location outside the mainstream. Whilst the entrepreneurs benefit from additional services provided by the self-storage operators, this may be at the expense of extra “liminal” work and anxiety experienced by the storage operators’ staff. Originality/value – The study contributes to entrepreneurship by answering Steyaert and Katz’s (2004) call for studies in unfamiliar places and spaces. The authors identify a number of ways in which liminality can arise when considering entrepreneurial locations. Drawing on extant entrepreneurial studies, the authors theorise that idiosyncratic characteristics of such spaces attract entrepreneurs with particular personal characteristics and needs, who will in turn be influenced by those spaces. In the case of self-storage facilities, the liminal space allows trepidatious entrepreneurs to “try on” (Hawkins and Edwards, 2015, p. 39) operating a new venture.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:05","2025-07-26 06:53:05","","436-457","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Business location; Liminality; Small firm/new venture strategy; Start-ups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis shows that the literature discusses TIP-related challenges in all stages of the policy cycle but does not provide much guidance on how to address key cross-cutting policymaking challenges such as how to achieve broad stakeholder involvement, evaluate transformative outcomes, and build up dynamic policymaker capabilities. In order for TIP ideas to be implemented in real-life policymaking, TIP scholars, therefore, need to more explicitly consider the practitioners’ perspective and develop concrete models, tools and guidelines that help policymakers address the identified challenges.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:05","2025-07-26 06:53:05","","14-40","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Directionality; Grand challenges; Mission-oriented; Policy cycle; Policy paradigm; Socio-technical transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling (maximum likelihood estimation method). Findings Social approval, supportive cultural environment and entrepreneurial self-identity had positive statistically significant direct effects on entrepreneurial intentions. Also, entrepreneurial self-identity partially mediated the effects of social approval and supportive cultural environment on entrepreneurial intentions. The total effect of supportive higher education institutions on entrepreneurial intentions was statistically significant, despite the direct and indirect effects being non-significant.

Using qualitative methods and building upon institutional perspectives of sustainable change, we show how being confronted with adverse poverty and pollution in local contexts can drive an entrepreneurial university to develop a sustainability vision that accordingly becomes the driver of institutional change. We demonstrate how local campus leadership, a holistic teaching and research programme, and student involvement can have significant local effects over the short term. However, we also show how liabilities of smallness hinder the creation of significant sustainable local impact. Instead, the campus becomes an incubation space for novel institutional practices for regional development. Indeed, the most promising initiatives return to the original campus for scaling up. This study helps to characterize the entrepreneurial university by first presenting universities as drivers for sustainable change through education and outreach, rather than via traditional commercialization activities and notably in developing countries. Second, the study illustrates the risks and value of creating a separate space for novel concepts for sustainable development to be tested prior to returning these concepts to the principal location.","2019","2025-07-26 06:53:05","2025-07-26 06:53:05","","195-205","","","141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sustainability; Regional development; Entrepreneurial University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By taking the digital economy industry in Guangzhou City as a case, this study reveals that given the different initial conditions, innovative entrepreneurship, institutional entrepreneurship and place-based leadership have paid distinct and dynamic roles in different specific contexts and phases. In the well-developed core district (Tianhe) gathered universities and research institutes, innovative entrepreneurs have acted as initial drivers for the development of the digital economy industry at the early path creation phase, while institutional entrepreneurs also provided support to enhance the industrial agglomeration in the following periods. In the late-developing peripheral district (Huangpu) with the lack of innovative resources, institutional entrepreneurship and place-based leadership are crucial to nurturing the new digital industry in the early phase, while conducive industrial assets and innovative entrepreneurs are also needed to cultivate the development of new industries in the future. Therefore, a longitude and multi-actor approach is needed to understand regional industrial path creation in different geographical contexts.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:05","2025-07-26 06:53:05","","103341","","","169","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","China; Digital economy industry; Evolutionary economic geography; Guangzhou City; Path creation; Spatial evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach Two schools that used LS as an approach to PD over a period of at least three years were identified. The theoretical framework of institutionalism guided the methodology and analysis of findings, seeking to explore relationships between institutionalised PD practices at national and school level, and how interactions between actors in schools helped or hindered the institutionalism of LS. The qualitative case studies included document analysis, observations of LS practices and interviews with teachers and leaders engaging in LS. Findings The findings reveal the importance of institutional entrepreneurs, who create a narrative to support LS, allocate resources to enable it and create a “relational space”, in which it can be tested and tweaked before sharing with others in the school. An institutional entrepreneur is particularly vital when national regulatory frameworks prescribe specific PD types that are not conducive to LS (such as in Portugal). However, even in more open frameworks, the entrepreneur needs to frame the LS model to fit institutionalised expectations. Originality/value This study, with its analysis of strategies that support sustained use of LS in schools, advances the growing field of LS research. This field of research is moving its focus from short-term LS projects that concentrate on immediate impact on teachers and students, to a sustainable approach that uses LS for in-service, school-based teacher PD, a practice with a long history in Japan.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:05","2025-07-26 06:53:05","","133-152","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Professional development; Institutionalism; Implementation; Lesson study; Policy borrowing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using survey data collected from 195 Chinese firms, the study concludes that institutional support and institutional entrepreneurial opportunity recognition represent two significant mediating mechanisms by which managerial political ties can result in improved firm performance.

We will examine both the ‘turning points’ (Abbott, 2001) in the evolution of the organizational form as well as the transformation processes implemented by an institutional entrepreneur to achieve these evolutions. Our analysis sheds light on how a social enterprise gradually transforms itself to better contribute to the sustainable development of its territory and the mobilization of local citizens. It also shows that a different form of local development 'by and for local people' is possible.

Bibliometric analysis, along with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling enables us to identify key trends and themes in the SE domain. This approach is superior to tools and methods used in the past, which primarily employed systematic literature reviews and bibliometric analysis. While systematic manual literature reviews become impractical as the literature grows, bibliometric analysis focuses on the most cited articles, ignoring recent influential work, suffering from citation biases, and giving more weight to impact over thematic discovery. The methodology used by us overcomes these issues by first extracting large amounts of information through advanced computational methods and then using unsupervised machine learning to discover the latent themes and topics in this large collection of publications. This research uses the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases to extract corpora of 3844 texts (titles, abstracts, and keywords) from published research on SE. We decipher the key trends in the literature and segregate them into three broad categories – individual attributes and motivation, organizational actions, and institutional conditions and development, with 21 sub-topics to enhance the understanding of this field of inquiry.

Following a literature review, we present the Nature-Based Innovation System (NBIS) framework delineating critical factors for urban nature-based innovation. We find both commonalities and differences between TIS and NBIS, suggesting that the roles of place-based dynamics, agency and governance structure are more central to nature-based innovation, and market formation is more central to technological innovation.

A multilevel analysis is performed based on set of 377,356 observations from 51 countries spanning eight years (2001-2008). Findings The results suggest that entrepreneurial readiness has a strong relationship with entrepreneurial behaviour (as measured by entrepreneurial entry and opportunity-based entrepreneurship) and that this relationship strengthens with increases in political democracy (PD), government regulations (GR), financial capital availability (FCA) and market liquidity (ML). Research limitations/implications The study is based on Holmes et al.’s (2013) institutions that are most important for society, uses satisfactory sample size and multi-level modelling. However, many more institutional conditions that remain to be considered might affect entrepreneurial activities.

The study is set in the geographical context of three small and old industrial towns, where traditional industrial practices are embedded in the material and institutional environment and people's behaviours that form a distinctive industrial culture. Conceptually, we use a relational perspective to investigate the dialectic between human agency and industrial culture: we examine how industrial culture can guide human agency–through motivation, legitimation, or specific behaviour; and how human agency reshapes industrial culture through its actions–destruction, modification, maintenance of cultural assets. The results show that a strong industrial culture implies a more reproductive type of agency and a pronounced collective behaviour of actors, aiming at a more incremental development that reflects the existing place-based culture. In the case where industrial culture is thinner, new development relied on individual agents completely altering development paths. Our research places particular emphasis on collective assets and collective agency in the context of smaller towns with strong industrial culture and their ability to influence the direction of future development.

Despite considerable attention on this matter, contributions have not explored the policy process of directionality, nor examined empirical cases to study directionality in practice. Considering these gaps, this paper presents an in-depth case study of the Dutch Automated Driving initiative that was developed under a smart mobility agenda with transformative aims (2013–2018). This initiative was rapidly championed by policymakers, and the agenda geared almost exclusively to its development. To study the policy processes therein, we used an adapted version of the Multiple Streams Framework (MS) (Kingdon, 1984). MS suggests that directions of policy change are determined by institutional entrepreneurs who have access to policy venues. We found that these entrepreneurs used political strategies (e.g. framing, problem-solution coupling) to champion automated vehicles as a transformative technology. However, eventually the transformative potential promises were not kept, leading to policy failure. In contrast, entrepreneurs’ self-interests dominated the policy implementation phase. This paper suggests that more attention should be given in how directions set in the early policy phases can be kept throughout the policy process.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","120243","","","161","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innovation policy; Directionality; Automated driving; Policy entrepreneurship; Policy process; Transformative innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The literature has expanded greatly in the past four to five years. One area that has seen significant application and growth is in supply chain management—which includes transportation and logistics. The growth of this literature has also resulted in several literature reviews—each has specific scope and emphasis. Of the growing number of literature review and bibliometric analysis studies, the focus has ranged from understanding application cases, themes, trends, and methodologies. Theoretical developments and theorizing have been limited for supply chain management in general and even more limited for sustainable supply chains. Arguably, much of the current research has been relatively atheoretical—a lack of theory development and theory application. Hence, we conclude the existing blockchain research discourse has been centered around application and less around the theory. As a sub-discipline, the nexus of blockchain and supply chain management is still in the early developmental stages. Using a critical synthesis review of the literature, this paper focuses on the most popular theories that have been applied to explain blockchain adoption and implementation within supply chains—how each theory explains the motivations, formalizes the organizational process around the acceptance of blockchain technology, and predicts the outcomes of blockchain-supported business models. Current theoretical gaps and potential future theorizing are discussed. Potential theories that have been used for other technologies (i.e., the internet of things) which have not been applied to the blockchain context are provided and discussed. The comprehensive and systematic theory review has important theoretical and managerial implications for both academia by advancing multiple academic disciplines and practice with insights into actual acceptance and usage of blockchain and other disruptive technologies.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","102824","","","164","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sustainability; Literature review; Supply chain management; Blockchain technology; Theory building","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The competing logics of the state as shareholder and their impact on corporate governance and shareholder activism offer fertile grounds for research advances in Coordinated Market Economies (CMEs). Design/methodology/approach Through an extensive literature review of state ownership, institutional contradictions and shareholder activism, this paper analyzes two case studies involving the French State as shareholder. Findings In the French context, these two cases illustrate how institutional contradictions result in opportunities for shareholder activism. By focusing on the institutional contradictions of the state shareholder, this investigation suggests a need for experimental research to observe how shareholder activists adapt to each institutional change in CMEs. This experimentation can help policymakers to avoid creating additional conditions that shareholder activists can exploit. Research limitations/implications This focuses only on France and its state shareholdings. To generalize results, studies of other CMEs and state shareholders are needed. Practical implications Policymakers should consider all legislative proposals for their potential to deviate from corporate governance practice by experimenting with them in a laboratory setting. Shareholder activists can compare state shareholders’ actions against the state’s legislation to emphasize institutional contradictions that counter minority shareholders’ rights.

The balanced scorecard (BSC) is one of the models adapted and promoted for use in that setting. After more than 30 years of practice, this study reviews the leading literature published on the BSC for government entities and considers how it has been developed, the main insights gained and what could be investigated further. Design/methodology/approach A literature review procedure inspired by a structured literature review process was conducted using the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Findings Our research approach allowed us to obtain 39 articles published in 26 journals, showing a steady interest over the period from 1999 to 2022. These studies mainly adopt a case study approach with a practical orientation. With diverse situations reported, ranging from more beneficial situations to ones involving greater difficulties, this study calls for future researchers to investigate not only the implementation and use issues of the BSC but also its continuing use over time and the course that its application may take. Additionally, future researchers should not ignore the political and social issues concerning its implementation and use.

In these discussions, the concept of legitimacy is omnipresent but often implicit and underdeveloped. There is no agreement about what legitimacy is or how it works across social science disciplines, despite a prolific volume of the literature centering legitimacy. Objective This study aims to explore the meaning of legitimacy in health and technology as conceptualized in the distinctive disciplines of organization and management studies, science and technology studies, and medical anthropology and sociology, including how legitimacy is produced and used. This allows us to critically combine insights across disciplines and generate new theory. Methods We conducted a critical interpretive synthesis literature review. Searches were conducted iteratively and were guided by preset eligibility criteria determined through thematic analysis, beginning with the selection of disciplines, followed by journals, and finally articles. We selected disciplines and journals in organization and management studies, science and technology studies, and medical anthropology and sociology using results from the Scopus and Web of Science databases and disciplinary expert–curated journal lists, focusing on the depth of legitimacy conceptualization. We selected 30 journals, yielding 796 abstracts. Results A total of 97 articles were included. The synthesis of the literature allowed us to produce a novel conceptualization of legitimacy as a form of social infrastructure, approaching legitimacy as a binding fabric of relationships, narratives, and materialities. We argue that the notion of legitimacy as social infrastructure is a flexible and adaptable framework for working with legitimacy both theoretically and practically. Conclusions The legitimacy as social infrastructure framework can aid both academics and decision makers by providing more coherent and holistic explanations for how and why new technologies are adopted or not in health care practice. For academics, our framework makes legitimacy and technology adoption empirically approachable from an ethnographic perspective; for decision makers, legitimacy as social infrastructure allows for a practical, action-oriented focus that can be assessed iteratively at any stage of the technology development and implementation process.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 14:44:12","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","literature review; health care delivery; technology adoption; legitimacy; critical interpretive synthesis; health care governance; health technology; infrastructure; social infrastructure; technology acceptance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many companies face challenges due to limited legitimacy, leading to scarce resources and a lack of commitment. Previous research has paid little attention to various ways to develop foresight capability, particularly at the intermediate stage of foresight maturity, where legitimacy is often lacking. We address this issue by exploring alternative organizing models to demonstrate foresight's value within firms. We conceptualize a corporate foresight system (CFS) comprising structures, roles, and activities for managing futures knowledge. Through a multiple case study of eleven large companies with intermediate foresight maturity, we identify four legitimate CFS archetypes: function-driven, independent foresight unit, executive team-led, and platform-based models. Using 43 semi-structured interviews, a pre-questionnaire survey, and workshops, we characterize these archetypes, examine their strengths and weaknesses and identify ‘windows of opportunity’ for further legitimation by extending and refining an initial CFS. Theoretically, we develop the concept of CFS, identify four CFS archetypes for companies with intermediate foresight maturity, and discuss how they contribute to demonstrating foresight's value within firms. Practically, our findings provide guidance for managers seeking to develop foresight capability by identifying approaches to legitimize foresight within an organization.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","124117","","","215","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge management; Corporate foresight; Legitimation; Organization design; Organizational integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the role of regional entrepreneurial spirit, which reflects local agency in arbitrage and innovation, has been largely ignored in shaping value-related economic activities. At the same time, new digital technologies provide the “opportunity window” for both firms and regions in the era of the digital economy. The issue of how regional entrepreneurial spirit exerts influence on global economic participation under the context of digitalization is worthy of further investigation. Thus, this study attempts to investigate the impacts of regional entrepreneurial spirit on local GVCs participation in China as well as the moderating role of digital transformation signals. With a big dataset matching from diversified sources, we find that regional entrepreneurial spirit has a significantly positive influence on local GVCs participation, which is moderated by the digital transformation signals from leading firms and local governments. In the early stages, the positive moderating effect from local governments is more stable and reliable, while leading firms' signals become more crucial in the latter stages. Furthermore, this moderating effect is more pronounced in cities with higher level of inclusiveness.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","103698","","","182","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","China; Digital transformation signals; GVCs; Regional entrepreneurial spirit; Tobit model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review methodology was adopted. The review used three gauges to identify enabling factors contributing to the development of enterprise in nanotechnology-related industries in a French context: first, it analysed the literature related to the development of nanotechnologies in a perspective of sustainability in a multidisciplinary stance (“Green view”). Second, it took a disciplinary stance by exploring academic journals in the field of entrepreneurship (“Entrepreneurship view”). Third, it studied the perspective of France (“French view”). Findings The main finding is that in spite of different approaches and sometimes seemingly conflicting stances, the three views converge on three enabling factors: the importance of knowledge sharing across boundaries, access to university scientists and facilities, and government intervention. However, each view also has its particularities: the “Green view” emphasizes the need for civil society inclusion, the “Entrepreneurship view” underlines the importance of early stage capital and entrepreneurial behaviour and the “French view” concentrates on the role of clusters. Research limitations/implications The paper provides a theoretical framework and a starting point for further work on entrepreneurial nanotechnology facilitation. Its findings constitute a benchmark which may be tested in empirical cases. The focus on the French context may be seen as a limitation but also as a source of interesting comparative work focussing on other national or regional contexts. Practical implications The paper shows that public policy is an important element in the nascent field of enterprise development for nano-based materials. It outlines how different contexts create different barriers to entrepreneurship, and it proposes recommendations to overcome some of these barriers. Originality/value In this paper, findings result from an exploration of the nanotechnology literature that focusses solely on nanotechnology data sets and not on mixed data sets. The use of three different gauges leads to the construction of a holistic theoretical framework that includes enabling factors as well as the types of barriers that entrepreneurs have to overcome to succeed.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","1009-1031","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sustainability; Barriers; Entrepreneurship; Public policy; Enabling factors; Nanotechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Institutions and institutional change have been identified as critical issues, as regional institutional settings significantly influence the pace and scope of sustainability transitions. However, the complex institutional dynamics underpinning 'Regional Transition Paths to Sustainability' (RTPS) are not well understood. Underexplored is in particular the link between short time gradual changes on the micro-level and long-term transformative change on the system level. In order to add to a more profound understanding of these processes, a focus on organizational change is valuable. The basic argument made in this article is that the emergence of new temporary and more permanent forms of organization has the potential to enable de-institutionalization and new institutionalization processes simultaneously. As we will show, new organizational forms also serve as a means to make institutional dynamics visible. The contribution of this paper is thus twofold: By combining insights from sustainability transition theory, evolutionary economic geography and neoinstitutional organization theory, we develop an original conceptual framework. By developing and applying the methodological approach of a 'transition topology', the potential of this framework for comparative research on actors and processes in different regional transition path to sustainability is revealed.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","104006","","7","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Organizational change; Institutional dynamics; Multiplicity; Regional sustainability transitions; Transition topology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to provide an insight into the relationship between motivations and social and economic performance among women social entrepreneurs in ten European Union countries. Design/methodology/approach This paper classifies the motivations of women social entrepreneurs, drawing on the results of a survey conducted (n = 380) by the European Women’s Lobby. The paper then examines how these motivations relate to self-perceptions of social and economic performance. Findings In addition to being driven by self-interest and prosocial motivations, women social entrepreneurs also seek to develop alternative business models. Where a social mission is central, women are likely to feel successful in meeting their social aim; however, there is a strong negative relationship between self-interested motivations and revenue. Research limitations/implications This analysis relies on perceptual and self-reported data; therefore, more objective measures should be considered for further research, possibly combined with a longitudinal design. Another limitation of this paper lies in the non-random sampling strategy used to identify a hard-to-reach population such as women social entrepreneurs. Practical implications The findings provide a better understanding of the motivations of women social entrepreneurs. This may be useful in assisting funding or support organisations, as well as social investors, evaluate where to best invest resources. In addition, a more nuanced understanding of motivations among women social entrepreneurs can inform policies aimed at supporting women social entrepreneurs, without necessarily being bound by the expectation to maximise economic and/or social outcomes. Originality/value This paper demonstrates the centrality of the social mission for women social entrepreneurs. The results also identify “seeking an alternative business model” as a key motivation among women social entrepreneurs, thereby breaking existing conceptualisations of entrepreneurial motivations on a binary spectrum as either “self-interested” or “prosocial”. The paper also shows that having other than prosocial motivations for becoming a social entrepreneur does not necessarily lead to higher economic revenue.","2018","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","312-327","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gender; Performance; Women; Motivations; Social entrepreneurs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analysis of the product innovation of a Knock-Out Cup in English County Cricket between the 1930s and 1960s shows that when the economic viability of a mature cultural field is threatened, actors learn to recursively create market and political opportunities for institutional entrepreneurship by deploying the resources of their field positions in tactics targeted at shifting product category boundaries. We find that ‘lone hero’ institutional entrepreneurs who experience failure from working in relative isolation learn to acquire new resources and deploy them in new tactics leading to a more collective approach, which is necessary for disrupting the institutional gatekeeping work that maintains a mature cultural field.","2013","2025-07-26 06:53:06","2025-07-26 06:53:06","","51-68","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional entrepreneurship; Institutional change; Opportunities; Cultural fields; Lone heroes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Institutional theories also seem to be gaining the attention of scholars investigating large, global, infrastructure projects as reported in engineering, management and construction journals. Increasingly, it is evident that the problem areas attached to these projects stretch beyond technical issues: they must be considered as socio-technical endeavours embedded in complex institutional frames.

We distinguish between four different niche contexts: market-based niche development, market-based regime transformation, community-based niche development and community-based regime transformation. This typology is then conceptually combined with theory on institutional entrepreneurship and institutional work to examine the diverse agential processes of institutional change through which actors shape and transform their institutional environments. The usefulness of this framework is explored in an analysis of the low-carbon building stock in the Netherlands.

Based on an analysis of the parallel development of the neighboring disciplines of innovation studies and project management, we show that the sharing of concepts and empirical domains can have ambivalent effects. Under conditions of ideological distancing, shared concepts and domains will be narrowly assimilated − an effect we call ‘encapsulation’ – which creates an illusion of sharing, while promoting further self-containment. By comparison, reflexive meta-theories and cross-disciplinary community-building will enable a form of sharing that promotes cross-fertilization.

Most of these makeshifts which are constructed on idle site unsuitable for long-term housing development are removed after a stipulated period for the site to be used for other purposes. With the growing supply of these short-term housing and potential increase in construction and demolition (C&D) waste, circular economy (CE) becomes necessary for waste reduction and material recovery for relocation and reconstruction. However, studies on drivers for circularity in transitional housing are limited. An institutional change is crucial to end the prevailing institutional structure of the linear economy, characterised by demolition, for CE implementation. Underpinned by the institutional theory framework, a comprehensive literature review and questionnaire survey were conducted to identify the institutional drivers for circular transitional housing. Findings of the study revealed highly rated common and significantly different regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive CE drivers. The findings complement extant literature in addition to apprising policymakers of a combined top-down (strategic) and bottom-up (tactical) drivers for circularity in residential facilities that serve as stopgaps. This could enable policymakers and practitioners to accelerate CE adoption in transitional housing and general construction projects. Beyond Hong Kong, the findings are relevant to international organizations to facilitate circular transitional housing markets or strategies in countries that are prone to natural disasters or in case of emergency to provide short-term shelter for vulnerable individuals, with less C&D waste generation during and after construction and deconstruction of such facilities.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","106067","","","164","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional theory; Circular economy; Bottom-up and top-down drivers; C&D waste; Hong Kong; Transitional housing; Waste reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data was collected via questionnaires and interviews, resulting in five categories of factors that either help or hinder circular food business growth.

We explore that circular businesses strongly prioritize social and environmental goals and the impact of this when seeking (or avoiding) grants and other traditional business supports.

Growing pressure on coastal and marine resources, international conservation targets set for 2020, and the persistence of ‘paper parks’ (i.e. only nominally declared) are some of the main reasons behind this trend. Based on the assumption that the prevalence of paper parks is associated with shortcomings in their institutional design, this article explores how institutional change theories, mainly from historical institutionalism, could add to the understanding of marine protected area governance. First, mechanisms leading to either stability or change of institutions are reviewed. Then, examples from existing literature are used to illustrate how these mechanisms might be preventing or enhancing the progress of marine protected areas. The focus is on developing countries where poorly functioning marine protected areas seem to be the norm rather than the exception. The analysis reveals that institutional change theories can be a helpful analytical tool to examine how institutions encompassing well-known challenges of marine protected areas, such as terrestrial conservation poorly adapted to marine ecosystems, imported conservation paradigms not fitting local realities, and difficulties posed by an incoherence of policies and top-down approaches to management, have developed over time. Conditions leading actors to notice these problems and take action to solve them as well as how they go about implementing changes are also explored. Finally, it is suggested that the issues raised here regarding the persistence of problems and how they are being tackled, especially those concerning the political process, can be beneficial to other fields of environmental governance.","2015","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","154-162","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Environmental governance; Institutional change; Institutions; Marine protected areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of stewardship is increasingly used in research, policy and practice to articulate and describe responses to these challenges. However, there are multiple meanings and framings of stewardship across this wide user base that reflect different disciplinary purposes, assumptions and expertise, as well as a long history of use in both academic and lay contexts. Stewardship may therefore be considered a ‘boundary object’; that is, a conceptual tool that enables collaboration and dialogue between different actors whilst allowing for differences in use and perception. This paper seeks to map out the multiple meanings of stewardship in the literature and help researchers and practitioners to navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with using the term. We provide the first qualitative systematic review of stewardship, and identify four distinct meanings of the concept in the literature: Ethic, Motivation, Action and Outcome. We then develop a novel framework for thinking through and connecting these multiple meanings, centered around three dimensions: care, knowledge and agency. This framework is used to identify the care dimension and relational approaches as important areas for future stewardship research. In these efforts – and for scholars engaging with the stewardship concept more broadly – this paper can act as a helpful ‘centering device’, connecting practitioners, policy-makers and researchers from multiple disciplines in pursuit of sustainability.","2018","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","17-37","","","179","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Literature review; Natural resource management; Anthropocene; Environmental ethics; Human-nature relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the structural embeddedness of intermediaries has been explored in innovation studies and economic geography literature, few transition studies have systematically examined how the agency of transition intermediaries is affected by institutional contexts. Without a deeper understanding of this interplay, the literature risks a naive perception of transition intermediaries as free agents. This study investigates transition intermediation in diverse institutional contexts using a typology of organizational fields that draws on institutional theory. Cases of local government commitments to fleet electrification and cycling infrastructure show that crises allow incumbent organizations to diverge from existing institutional arrangements and intermediate for systems change. Findings also indicate that the social position of transition intermediaries in a field can mute the enabling effect of crises on transition intermediation. Similarly, findings show that transition intermediaries can legitimize their visions for systems change by using collective action framing to draw attention to conflict between existing institutions to diverge from existing institutional arrangements. As such, this study provides new insight into conditions affecting the agency of transition intermediaries for low-carbon mobility transition.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","103707","","","154","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecology of intermediaries; Electric vehicle fleet; Institutional entrepreneur; Pop-up cycleway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sampling was stratified random, with a representative sample size of 734 cases. For data analysis and hypothesis testing, a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model were made. Findings The results show that the entrepreneurial self-efficacy attribute largely explains the entrepreneurial intent, while all other variables, such as entrepreneurial identity aspirations and outcome expectations, play a less important role but maintain some influence. Research limitations/implications According to the findings of this research, institutions of higher education should direct efforts to improve the entrepreneurial skills of students, especially for women.

We study the VAMO scheme located in Fortaleza, Brazil, as the first e-carsharing scheme in the country. We study two policies combined: a VAMO planned growth policy and a retirement policy for conventional vehicles. Our results show that the VAMO incentive policy is an important factor to reduce emissions and to increase awareness of electric vehicles, highlighting the role of the government as an institutional entrepreneur, stimulating and sustaining the VAMO scheme. The retirement policy in combination with the VAMO incentive policy obtained the best results in our simulations, reducing 29% of CO2 emissions and increasing 36% electric vehicle adoption, when compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The main conclusions are that such e-carsharing schemes offer direct and indirect benefits to urban mobility (specially to electric vehicle adoption) and that they depend on how the government supports them.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","102226","","","79","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Simulation; CO emissions; E-carsharing; Electric vehicles; Shared mobility; System dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results suggest that business (political) ties are positively (negatively) associated with operational performance, while both business and political ties are positively associated with innovation. Further, our result suggests that (a) approximately 14.2% of the effect of business ties on innovation is mediated by marketing capabilities and (b) industry type moderates the relationship between ties and performance.

The impact of entrepreneurship-related elements on consumption is frequently not considered. This paper uses a combination of systematic and narrative procedures to review existing interpretive consumer research literature selectively.

In this paper, we centre the analysis on how institutional contexts shape and influence adaptation limits as experienced by social actors. We emphasise institutions’ stability over time leading to delayed adaptation, their role in protecting more powerful rather than weaker social interests, and their tendency to generate punctuated rather than smooth changes in vulnerability to climate risks. We illustrate these arguments with two case studies of socio-ecological institutional regimes facing adaptation limits: water resources management in the Colorado River Basin; and disaster risk management in The Bahamas. These represent divergent risk governance contexts generating limits to adaptation for multiple social actors, despite the availability of plausible adaptation pathways. Our aim is to contribute to a generalisable approach to adaptation limits which can be applied in identifying and assessing critical choices in responses to growing climate change impacts.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","100611","","","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutions; Climate change adaptation; Colorado River Basin; Limits to adaptation; Risk; The Bahamas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are operationalised through an enhanced Technology Enactment Framework (TEF) to consider reforms to explore the DEG environment and, specifically, the interventions of the CIO on e-government policies. We employed a case analysis approach from public sector authorities in the US States of California and Nevada with data from CIOs and other key informants. Our findings reveal how public sector CIOs adopt the role of an ‘institutional entrepreneur’, who demonstrate a series of initiatives augmented through identified behaviours. These relate to proactive community mobilisation (leadership, member focus) and legitimisation (discourse, success stories). We outline the policy implications of DEG and the risk factors of senior managers who enact these processes towards complex technological change. Furthermore, the characterisation of institutional entrepreneurial enactment appears to be extremely beneficial to the transformation to DEG within any contemporary public sector context.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","223-236","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional entrepreneur; Digital governance; Enactment; Enterprise; Transformational change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing conceptual and empirical studies reveal that not all entrepreneurial intentions are ultimately translated into actual behaviour, resulting in an intention-behaviour gap. The current study reviewed the existing literature pertaining to this gap and found that most of the research has examined the contingent role of individual/psychological factors, yet how environmental factors, especially the institutional proximal circles, bridge the intention–behaviour link remains scarce. By employing questionnaire data (n = 1820) collected from university students in China, this research examines the effectiveness of university entrepreneurial offerings on student entrepreneurial intention realisation. The results illustrate that, although a high engagement level in university entrepreneurship education and venture creation contexts accelerates student entrepreneurs’ intention–behaviour translation, the positive effect of instrumental offerings (start-up support services) is stronger than that of entrepreneurship education offerings (entrepreneurial courses and extra-curricular activities). This research extends the application of the theory of planned behaviour to the start-up process by highlighting the entrepreneurship education and venture creation factors derived from the university milieu students are exposed to in accelerating the conversion from entrepreneurial intention to nascent start-up behaviour. It captures the association amidst the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education in aspiring student entrepreneurs’ entrepreneurial learning, intention actualisation, and tangible start-up activities. These findings also draw researchers’ attention to explore further the nuances of various entrepreneurial offerings in student venture creation and how to build an effective university entrepreneurial ecosystem.","2023","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","100305","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Student entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship education effectiveness; Intention–behaviour gap; Start-up behaviour; University entrepreneurship context","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The area of research is topical considering the rise of EMs on the global scene and the importance of entrepreneurship in the development of EMs. Design/methodology/approach The paper utilizes scientometrics to provide a systematic review of the emerging field of entrepreneurship in EMs (EEMs). The entire Web of Science database was searched, and 2,568 scholarly outputs were extracted and analyzed as a result. The review further compares the EEMs research to the mainstream entrepreneurship research based on the top trending and high impact themes, demonstrates which countries published and are studied in the EEMs scholarship, and finally, it provides a proportion of empirical research done on EEMs to highlight methods utilized in the existing research. Findings The scientometric review reveals three broad domains of the EEMs scholarship–(1) Entrepreneurship in EMs and its implications; (2) MNEs, institutional environments, and FDI; and (3) Strategy, innovation and performance. The findings demonstrate that EEMs' scholarship primarily discusses environments within which EEMs takes place, the implications of EEMs, strategy and performance of EEMs (macro and meso-levels), thus highlighting the need for micro-level (individual-based) analysis of EEMs. Approximately, a third of the EEMs research is of empirical nature, more should be done especially in quantitative studies to develop this field further.

Several of the PPI implementation challenges reported in prior research originate in the institutional architecture underpinning demand articulation, and innovation procurement and adoption processes. We conceptualise innovation intermediaries as institutional entrepreneurs who seek to create new institutions or adjust existing ones to support PPI implementation. We report the results of two case studies of intermediaries facilitating PPI in the UK defence and health sectors, respectively. We contribute to PPI intermediation literature by showing that intermediaries address prevalent institutional failures through four types of institutional entrepreneurship activities: boundary spanning; advocacy; design of change; and capacity building. We elucidate, in particular, the role of individuals within intermediaries, as agents who learn about failures and adapt their institutional work over time. In doing so, these managers go beyond the remit and goals of the organisations they represent. The findings add to our understanding of how intermediaries support demand articulation for PPI by showing that their institutional work is also aimed at designing generic methods and processes to improve what is asked for, and how. We furthermore reveal conditions influencing the effectiveness of intermediaries' efforts to realise institutional change, thereby extending research on institutional entrepreneurship in PPI settings.","2023","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","104673","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional entrepreneurship; Innovation policy; Innovation intermediaries; Institutional change; Public procurement; Public procurement of innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies published between 2015 and 2024 was conducted using the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). The analysis followed Braun and Clarke’s (2006) six steps of thematic analysis. A total of 16 articles were analyzed. Findings This study found that national quality assurance systems played a pivotal role in promoting dual accreditation through internationalization by establishing standards, providing guidance and incentivizing institutions to meet national and global benchmarks. HEIs have been motivated to pursue dual accreditation by various factors, including enhanced reputation, internationalization, financial stability, quality assurance, policy compliance, benchmarking and graduate employability. However, the dual accreditation process has often been characterized by administrative burdens, differences in standards, language barriers, lack of transparency and institutional misalignment. While these challenges have persisted, HEIs have developed strategies to address them, such as effective planning, resource management, communication, collaboration, knowledge sharing and a tailored approach. Originality/value This systematic scoping review of the ERIC database offers a comprehensive overview of the research on higher education dual accreditation.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","973-988","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Higher education; Strategic management; Leadership; Dual accreditation; International accreditation; National accreditation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The university-city relationship is also encouraged for the benefit of the city, as universities unleash their respective cities’ potentials to act as driving forces not only for their local communities, but also for the whole nation. Therefore, maintaining a mutual relationship between the university and the city is considered essential to accomplish strategic goals for both. However, the nature of this relationship is quite complex, overlapped, interconnected, and diverse. Therefore, this paper conducted a systematic review of the literature on university-city and campus-city relationships to evaluate recent research trends to uncover the aspects that connect universities with their respective cities. The search included articles published in 4 different databases from January 1990 to January 2021. A total number of 50 articles were selected in this review. The findings uncovered different aspects that could help or hinder university-city relationship based on the physical and functional linkage between the campus and the city. Moreover, findings have shown that it is necessary to understand universities according to their contextual differences, as universities have shown different impacts on their respective cities in terms of their sizes and locations. Results have also shown that the impact of the physical connection between the university and the city goes far beyond campus’s accessibility as it deeply affects students’ social life as well. Therefore, decision makers, stakeholders, and university administrators need to co-design campus development process especially in the early stages to maximize the mutual benefits of campus-city relationship. The main conclusions of this paper address several perspectives and lessons for a more sustainable campus-city relationship.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","53-67","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sustainability; Campus-city relationship; Stakeholders’ partnership; University engagement; University-city relationship; Urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach The framework of experience co-creation was conceptualized by means of a literature review. Subsequently, this framework was used as the conceptual basis for a qualitative content analysis of 66 empirical papers investigating alternative consumption models (ACMs), such as renting, remanufacturing, and second-hand models. Findings The qualitative content analysis resulted in 12 categories related to the consumer and 9 related to the ACM offerings that represent the antecedents of experience co-creation. These categories provide evidence that, to a large extent, the developed conceptual framework allows one to capture the multi-dimensionality of the experience co-creation construct.

More specifically, the study highlights the links between family, culture, institution and entrepreneurial behaviour in the African context. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a qualitative research method by interviewing 50 entrepreneurs and community leaders of the Igbo nation. Igbos have been described as “naturally enterprising and ingenious” and can be found throughout Nigeria and West Africa. Understanding the vagaries of ethnic entrepreneurship can arguably only be achieved through research that is undertaken within these socio-historically rich, traditional and cultural contexts. Findings Linked to the social learning theory, Igbo families provide an entrepreneurial leadership platform which influences youths through role models, providing mastery experiences and socialisation. The extended family provides a safe environment for risk taking, creativity and innovation. Also, an informal apprenticeship system provides entrepreneurial learning that prepares the younger generation to take to business as a way of life. Research limitations/implications The study is based on a relatively small sample size of 50 respondents, which makes it difficult to generalise the findings despite the benefits of the research methods adopted in the study. Also, there are limitations to the extension of the findings to a generalised Igbo population comprising individuals who may, or may not, behave entrepreneurially. Practical implications There are significant practical implications, both nationally and internationally, for policy makers that are concerned with developing jobs for the growing population of unemployed youths and inclusive entrepreneurship in Nigeria. Originality/value The research has three main contributions. First, it valorises indigenous knowledge of family and institutional entrepreneurial behaviour in an African context. Second, it highlights the importance of the linked institutions of the extended family and the informal apprenticeship system in Igbo culture. Finally, it provides a model and an explanation of how the Igbo culture nurtures and develops transgenerational entrepreneurial behaviour.","2019","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","34-53","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional theory; Entrepreneurship; Family firms; Institutions; Ethnic groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The institutional entrepreneur theory provided the theoretical lens and informed a reflexive iterative data analysis. Findings While each case faced unique challenges, there were similarities and differences in how managers enhanced a partnership’s institutional logic. In both cases, entrepreneurial healthcare managers created new roles, negotiated mutually beneficial agreements and co-located staff to foster inter-organisational partnerships between public, private and community organisations in the continuum of care for older adults. In addition, managers in Ontario secured additional funding, while managers in Quebec organised biannual meetings and joint training to enhance inter-organisational partnerships.

This study categorizes the good practices identified in the reports and discusses how the nature of the practices influences the potential learning from them. The authors then apply the results from the discussion of this study to current policy developments on RRI. Findings The two most often mentioned good practices overall are organizational policies and the establishment of organizational units, but the type of good practices recommended differs across the various aspects of the RRI umbrella concept. This diversity within the RRI construct is a practical argument against the effectiveness of RRI as an umbrella concept.

Using the illustrative case of the German wood-based sector, we depict power relations of industry associations comparing a dyadic and a systemic perspective. Given the resulting differences, we argue that a systemic perspective that considers the structural embeddedness of industry associations’ power relations can better reveal potential innovation dynamics in industrial sectors.

Despite the proliferation of leadership models, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive reviews that connect progressive leadership theories with fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in education. This narrative literature review aims to identify pertinent theories of educational leadership—such as instructional, distributed, and transformational leadership—and explore their potential applications in driving innovation and entrepreneurship within educational settings. The objective is to assess how these leadership approaches can cultivate creativity, encourage risk-taking, and champion entrepreneurship to enhance educational outcomes. This review draws from databases like ‘Taylor and Francis Online,’ ‘ResearchGate,’ ‘Elsevier,’ and search platforms such as ‘Google Scholar’ and ‘ERIC.’ Eight key elements critical for leaders to promote an entrepreneurial culture were identified, including goal-setting, fostering collaboration, and adopting risk-taking approaches. By highlighting these elements, this review addresses the need to reassess leadership theories to align with the evolving demands of modern education, thus offering unique insights into bridging leadership with innovation and entrepreneurship.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","101173","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Entrepreneurship education; Distributed leadership; Educational leadership; Innovation in education; Instructional leadership; Transformational leadership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a growing body of research offers alternative perspectives about markets from the neoclassical perspective, it ignores the degree of embeddedness of the state in markets. In view of this theoretical gap, we investigate the market-shaping activities of states in emerging economies. Our context is the creation of a Korean cultural product market in Vietnam. Based on a document analysis of the nation branding projects of Korea and Vietnam, we investigate how these states are involved in shaping Vietnamese markets for Korean cultural products through their international and national activities. The findings reveal that whereas the Korean state is mobilizing and building diplomatic ties to promote the Korea’s image in Vietnam through its cultural products, the Vietnamese state profits from these products for its East Asian oriented cultural policy. Three actions are being taken by the Vietnamese state: (1) controlling the distribution of Korean cultural products, (2) framing media producers’ and consumers’ behaviors, and (3) creating a network of collaboration between selected Korean and Vietnamese media producers. Through their nation branding practices, the Vietnamese and Korean states act as institutional entrepreneurs in shaping the Vietnamese market for Korean cultural products.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","131-144","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vietnam; Developmental state; Korean wave; Market-shaping; Nation branding; South Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This extends the theory of institutional entrepreneurship by demonstrating how regulatory frameworks can incentivize corporate actors to adopt sustainable practices. It highlights the critical role of regulatory environments in shaping institutional entrepreneurship, suggesting that stringent regulations can effectively drive organizations toward sustainability. This perceived normative and cognitive pressure aligns with Levy and Kolk (2002), which suggests that climate strategies are formulated by managers from countries where such environmental practices are strictly required (Pinkse, 2007). Compared with previous studies, this paper reveals that collective institutional entrepreneurship can create opportunities for integrating sustainability policies under favorable conditions. Unlike Jolly et al. (2016), who highlighted the isolated and contested actions of individual actors, this study shows that sustainability policies and developments by legacy aviation groups often overlap at both micro (individual) and meso (organizational or institutional) levels. This intersection of corporate values with individual passengers, other subsidiary airlines and international community expectations underscores a collective institutional entrepreneurship that fosters integrated sustainability policies under favorable conditions.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:07","2025-07-26 06:53:07","","104394","","","136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional entrepreneurship; Sustainability transition; South Korea; Aviation industry; CORSIA; Emission trading system (ETS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on Lascoumes and Le Gales's “public policy instrument and instrumentation” framework (2007), this article analyzes the implementation of Montreal SIS and discusses how the organizational aspects of SIS produce the contexts for drug injection. Methods Using an ethnographic approach, this article draws on three types of data: 10 months of participant observation in a SIS (700 h); 19 semi-structured interviews with staff members (social workers, peers, heads of staff, management); and analysis of organizational documents (protocols, staff notebooks). Results First, this article examines how political context and advocacy coalitions produced Montreal SIS as a public policy instrument, affecting both the philosophy and the implementation of the service. It shows that Montreal SIS were developed under a health care network blueprint rather than a community organization harm reduction framework. Then, it analyzes how SIS as a policy instrument defines what constitutes appropriate injection practices, trying to supervise injection as an individual and technical act, rather than a broader social practice composed of pleasure, rituals, routines, and group dynamics. Conclusion Montreal SIS were conceptualized under a “health banner” and through alliances between regional public health administration and local well-known community organizations. They were then developed mostly under a health care administration blueprint, although operated at a ground-level by local community organizations. It created tensions between the logics of “zero risk” and “harm reduction”, and ambiguity about how injection should be supervised and what parts of drug use could be managed.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","103694","","","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ethnography; Harm reduction; Montreal; Policy implementation; Public policy instrument; Supervised injection services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But there is limited understanding about forest agencies' role in the adoption of new governance modes and their contribution to policy delivery. By drawing on a qualitative implementation study of Bavaria's Mountain Forest Initiative in locally-operating forest agencies, the present paper addresses these gaps. The government wants them to establish collaborative arrangements with various stakeholders to facilitate measures for adaptation to climate change in private forests. The cross-case comparison provides detailed empirical insights into distinct sets of activities for making the initiative ‘work’. Stakeholder participation gains a firm basis at the local level if forest agencies develop interest in and generate ownership of prospects for collaborative planning, and tailor these to their needs. The study suggests, however, that involvement of local stakeholders in forest planning is not necessarily instrumental for delivery of effective policies, as reliance on the local level entails the risk that the broader picture of initial policy goals gets lost.","2014","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","43-50","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stakeholders; Institutions; Climate change adaptation; Forest governance; Forest policy; Local level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we draw on Social Identity Theory to develop a conceptual framework that links identity and identity conflict to change related behavior. In this framework, we explain how multiple identities constrain but also stimulate agentic behavior in organizations. In particular, we highlight the underlying mechanisms through which conflicts in multiple identities lead to institutional change through processes of identity work and job crafting. Moreover, we specify how job discretion and business involvement affect the embedded agency of management accountants operating in different professional roles. We further predict that changes in MA practices are likely to have an effect on management accountants’ identities and may create new identity conflicts if they diverge from existing institutionalized identities. We highlight the implications of this model for our understanding of embedded agency and for future research directions in the field.","2018","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","39-50","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Embedded agency; Management accounting; Change; Identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a growing interest in designing, facilitating, and evaluating such exploratory initiatives with respect to their systemic, less work has focused on how such initiatives support learning and capacity-building among its partaking actors and institutions including building experimental governance capacity. In this paper, we aim to better understand how exploratory and experimental initiatives with transformative sustainability ambitions relate to and influence their partaking actors and institutions. We draw from the North Mid Sweden Challenge Lab, an initiative to adapt, test and learn a governance approach to navigate complex sustainability challenges and transformations. It was part of a high impact action within a pilot for regional industrial transition framed around experiments in governance and policy by the European Commission and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where peer-learnings by and between regions was stated as an explicit goal. We focus on the kind of learning and knowledge creation processes that occur in these open-ended and multi-levelled social interaction processes. In this paper, we empirically engage with such learning processes with a focus on governance capacity, based on direct experiences from its participating actors and related institutions. This study builds on and extends conceptual understandings of scaling, embedding and other types of strategies and diffusion mechanisms in sustainability transformations and transitions with a focus on learning. We conclude that conducting exploratory initiatives seems to have functioned in legitimizing open-ended, cross-sectoral purposeful activities of deliberation, learning and search. However, sending out and leading explorations is not the same as preparing for and working with procedures to scale, transfer, embed and institutionalise learnings and results to alter mainstream ways of governing for complex challenges and systemic change – all key elements in developing experimental governance capacity in response to sustainability challenges.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","103740","","","156","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sustainability transition; Evaluation; Regional environmental policy; Regional innovation policy; Stakeholder learning; Sustainability transition labs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach This research is divided into two studies. The first study uses survey-based quantitative method and the second study uses focus group discussion (FGD) method. Using a purposive and proportional sampling technique in the first study, this research collected 1,985 samples of Islamic financial products of business owners (demand-side) from all parts of Indonesia. The data were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling approach. The authors also conducted FGDs, involving 35 participants from government, financial, social and education institutions (supply-side) as well as business owners (demand-side) in three separated times. Findings In the first study, it can be identified that literacy on Islamic finance, attitude and awareness strongly affect business owners’ intention to use Islamic financial products. It is also found that subjective norm significantly influences literacy, attitude and awareness. Interestingly, religiosity does not significantly affect attitude toward Islamic financial products. According to the FGD in the second study, this research generates several factors motivating business owners’ preference to choose conventional rather than Islamic financial products, including expensive pricing, less developed technology, bad service quality and the halal status of the products. The reason for insignificant results of religiosity on attitude in the first study is explained in the second study. Most users are utilitarians who mainly perceived the products based on the sought benefits provided by the products. Practical implications This research offers the government a road map showing the strategy to build Islamic financial ecosystem in Indonesia. The road map integrates supply-side, which includes government, financial industries, social and education institutions and scientific organizations, and demand-side, which includes business owners or entrepreneur associations. Originality/value This research provides a wide range of samples derived from business owners’ respondents of halal industry in all representative islands in Indonesia.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the applicability of three institutional approaches — (1) the earlier variant of the neoinstitutional theory (ENIT), (2) its recent variant (RNIT), and the comparative institutional analysis approach (CIA) — to explain (non)adaptation behavior in host country environments. Using Walmart's acquisition cases, we show that the MNE adopted a non-adaptation behavior in Mexico and Germany—countries which represent vastly different institutional environments—and succeeded in the former, but failed and withdrew from the market in the latter. However, in the Japanese institutional environment, which is similar to the German one, Walmart engaged in selective adaptation and survived in the market. Based on the case data, we offer a critical assessment of the applicability of the three approaches. These three approaches provide a base on which to develop a model to explain the relationship between institutional influences, an MNE's organizational agency and adaptation behavior, as well as outcomes. Moreover, we discuss future research directions and provide implications for practitioners related to MNEs' adaptation behavior and the ensuing outcomes in host markets.","2019","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","100655","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Case study; Comparative institutional analysis; International business; Local adaptation; Neoinstitutional theory; Retail industry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reviews the concept of innovation ecosystems as it is set forth in the academic and trade literature, and asks, “What is gained from adding ‘eco-’ to our treatment of national and regional innovation systems?” The answer is, “Very little, and the risks outweigh the benefits.” Innovation ecosystem is not yet a clearly defined concept, much less a theory. Moreover, the idea carries pitfalls, notably its over-emphasis on market forces, and its flawed analogy to natural ecosystems. The prospect that the phrase “innovation ecosystem” is here to stay, in investment and economic development circles, implies a research gap, and indicates caution in using the phrase in rigorous research. The paper describes the gap, indicates directions for bridging it, and offers recommendations for prudent use of “ecosystem” terminology.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","1-6","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Supply chain management; Business environment; Industry cluster; Innovation ecosystems; Innovation fora; Technopolis; Value chain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research based on a single case study in a multinational subsidiary company was carried out. The data were mainly collected using the dialog technique through open-ended and semi-structured interviews and complemented with direct observation in informal and formal meetings and the analysis of internal documents. Content analysis was used for the analysis of the findings. Findings The use of flexible budgets, which isolates the negative variations due to the decrease in sales volume, may contribute to organizational inertia. However, this can be counterbalanced if the managers try to minimize the decline in performance through initiatives that promote organizational flexibility. In this case study, it was found that the alignment between the production director and the controller, who frequently work under different institutional logics, was important to stimulate organizational flexibility particularly in continuous improvement projects. Research limitations/implications The findings of this paper are based on only one in-depth case study. Hence, the results cannot be generalized, but a theoretical contribution can be made. Furthermore, the findings are constrained by the constructs used and the specific managerial and theoretical perspectives that have supported the analysis. Practical implications These results can be useful particularly for companies that are dealing with the abrupt drop in the sales volume and use the flexible budget as a performance assessment technique. These firms must pay attention because this combination can stimulate organizational inertia. To counteract this problem, it is necessary that controllers and the managers work by understanding the initiatives that promote organizational flexibility, mainly by Kaizen projects, which can minimize performance decline. Social implications The main contribution may be how to deal with the different managers’ behaviors, given the decrease in sales volume, and it can help an organization survives in times of economic recession and fierce competition environments.

While participation in PES schemes is mandated in countries such as China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam, it remains unclear how PES schemes emerge in countries devoid of national mandates. This article investigates how actors have attempted institutional change to enable PES, by reinterpreting or adapting national laws, policies, and plans. We present an analytical framework theorising how geographical variations in (1) institutional frameworks, and (2) actor capabilities, dictate which institutions actors attempt to change. We then apply this framework to multi-scalar actors and institutions in Thailand and the Philippines. Our empirics reveal the types of institutional work that actors perform such as advocacy, education, mimicry, and networking, and demonstrate how this creates legal and discursive support, and improves stakeholder awareness and acceptance of PES as an environmental management strategy. Eight formal institutions are shown to have undergone change to enable PES across these countries, including those related to indigenous people, energy production, protected areas, pollution control, carbon offsetting, and decentralised governance. We show institutional change to be a geographical and contextual process that requires actors to match the right types of institutional work, with the right mechanism of institutional change, and a suitable target institution if they are to be successful in effecting change. Yet, we also report failed attempts, and explain how informal cultural norms act as challenges to formal institutional change. Through our comparative analysis of multiple institutions, actors, and national settings, we identify trends and make recommendations with global relevance to PES scholars and practitioners, and that can aid other initiatives that seek to address climate change and promote environmental sustainability.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","102227","","","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Environmental governance; Natural resource management; Conservation; Environmental policy; Payments for environmental services; Southeast Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using qualitative analysis, the mechanisms through which logics are selected, prioritised and get integrated in the strategies and practices of these organisations are illustrated. Findings The study contributes to the literature on hybrid organisations and their ability to address social problems in two important ways.

This study offers a comparison between female angels from a stereotype-threat–free environment and (a) male angels, and (b) female angel investors investing in a strongly male-dominated environment. Using proprietary survey data of 96 business angels, our findings confirm that the social context plays an important role in explaining female investment behavior and involvement in BA-group activities. We find that women in a female-only group do not feature investment behavior that differs significantly from men. Whereas women who invest as a minority in a male-dominated environment tend to behave differently. Investment experience, however, moderates the influence of male-dominated environments on female investment behavior. The study confirms earlier exploratory findings related to the role of stereotype threat in female business angel activity at the individual level. Contributing to stereotype threat theory and gender studies in the business angel literature, our findings suggest that the historically marginal contribution of women is a result of the social construction of their role in the finance industry, in which stereotype threats may be particularly prevalent, rather than of supposedly innate features of gender.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","102729","","","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gender; Performance; Human capital; Angel investing; Stereotype threat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This growing interest is largely because of the availability of European Union funds focussing on the work integration of disadvantaged groups but ignoring other possible roles of SEs. This study aims to consider a seldom examined and underfunded area: SEs’ institutional environment and organisational activities in the social and health sectors. Design/methodology/approach Based on neoinstitutional theory, the paper uses desk research and qualitative case studies. It presents the experiences of SEs providing social and health services for specific disadvantaged groups. Findings This paper identified the key actors influencing the everyday operation of SEs and examined their connections, interactions and partnerships. Based on the findings, SEs primarily depend on the central state, public social and health institutions and local governments. At the same time, their connections with private customers, networks, development and support organisations, third sector organisations and for-profit enterprises are less significant. The key actors have a relevant impact on the legal form, main activities and the financial and human resources of SEs. SEs, however, have little influence on their institutional environment.

Nevertheless, entities seem to find it important to be pilots, more for individual advantages than for the common benefit of the reform as a whole. Therefore, in order for them to actually be important actors in the reform process, pilots need to be included in the decision process, better realizing the benefits of the new IPSAS-based system and be provided with the proper technical, human and financial support. Research limitations/implications This research suffers from some limitations, namely concerning the use of questionnaires. The findings may, in some points, reflect the perceptions of the respondents and not the actual reality. Additionally, the respondents were not asked about any personal background factors, which may influence their answers. Also, they did not allow relating the new PSA system features with the way pilot entities (re)acted. In regard to the implications for practice, the study points to a need for decision-makers and external support bodies to work more closely with pilot entities in the overall design and implementation of PSA reforms. Pilot entities need to understand the importance and usefulness of changes, and reform authorities need to better recognize their institutional reality and the support they require. Only in this way, the use of pilots can make a difference in the implementation of PSA innovations. Originality/value This paper contributes to theory by adding to a better understanding of the role of the ones acting in the development and implementation of PSA innovations, enlightening on how pilot entities can act/react. Despite several studies on PSA reforms, very few so far have addressed pilot entities in particular, their attitude and actual contribution toward PSA reforms, and why. The case of Portugal as a frontrunner in adopting an IPSAS-based system within the EU helps contribute to that understanding in the setting of European countries.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:28","2025-07-26 06:53:28","","114-137","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional theory; Institutional logics; Accounting innovations; Implementation strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing upon an unusually rich dataset spanning 9752 digitized archival documents, we categorize and code decisions taken by policymakers on several levels while also mapping and quantifying the strategic activities of both entrant firms and incumbent monopolists over a decade. Our data concerns two empirical cases from Sweden during the time period 1980–1990: the financial sector and the telecommunications sector. In both industries, a combination of technological and institutional upheaval came into motion during this time period which in turn fueled the revitalization of the Swedish economy in the subsequent decades. Our findings show that Swedish policymakers in both cases consistently acted in order to promote the emergence of more competition and de novo entrant firms at the expense of established monopolies. The paper quantifies and documents this process while also highlighting several enabling conditions. In conclusion, the results indicate that successful innovation policy in mature economies is largely a matter of strategically dealing with resourceful vested interest groups, alignment of expectations, and removing resistance to industrial renewal.","2019","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","152-162","","","147","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second objective of this research is to understand how the experience in management consultancy leads to value addition in their class room teaching. Design/methodology/approach To address the first research objective, focus group discussions were conducted with management teachers practicing consultancy. These results were used to generate items for the questionnaire. Factor analysis performed on the data revealed six determinants influencing management teachers to engage in consulting activity. To address the second research objective, focus group discussions with MBA graduates were used to comprehend how teachers with management consulting experience enrich the pedagogy. Findings The major findings of the study suggest that the determinants influencing management teachers to practice consulting are: improving competencies, furthering professional advancement, accruing strategic and financial benefit, enabling holistic development. Through study 2, the authors found out that management teachers add value in pedagogy by forging corporate world connection through real-time examples, enable critical thinking by breaking established paradigms, effective classroom delivery through storytelling, etc., and lending student support by assuming a mentor’s role.

However, taking advantage of IT to innovate requires the existence of other organizational and institutional capabilities within the public organization. Using absorptive capability theory, the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between principles for IT governance and dynamic capabilities across semi-urban (between 10,000 and 149,000 inhabitants), urban (between 150,000 and 600,000 inhabitants) and metropolitan (more than 600,000 inhabitants ) municipal governments in Mexico. Design/methodology/approach This study reports on three workshops involving 34 chief information officers (CIOs) from semi-urban, urban and metropolitan municipalities. The workshop agenda included a series of brainstorming exercises to discuss – among other topics – the capabilities required for digital government innovation. The capabilities collected during the workshops were codified by the authors based on their relationship to the six IT governance standardized principles and the four dynamic capabilities identified in the literature. The authors used descriptive and correlation analyses to show the importance of governance principles and dynamic capabilities for innovation, as well as the relationships between those two dimensions, in each type of municipality. Findings This study shows that specific IT governance principles may enhance innovation capabilities linked with knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Moreover, the ways in which IT governance principles support innovation are linked to size, resources and complexity of the local government. In conclusion, this study discusses the primary IT policy implications to improve possibilities to innovate in the public sector. Originality/value Although researchers and practitioners agree that following principles of good governance may enhance performance and innovation in the provision of public services, the link between the principles of IT governance and capabilities to spur innovation has not yet been fully established in the literature. Thus, in this study, empirical evidence of this linkage is provided.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","149-169","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innovation; Absorptive capacity; Local government; Dynamic capabilities; IT governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a large evidence base related to 18 publicly-funded digital innovation intermediaries in France, including primary and secondary sources, we uncover the various forms of institutional work intermediaries engage in while facilitating the digital transition. We find that intermediaries' institutional work focuses on disrupting symbolic systems, creating relational systems and artefacts, and creating and maintaining routines.

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls‐Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest‐sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change. Resumen Las pequeñas comunidades basadas en recursos naturales de todo Canadá están experimentando rápidos cambios en una economía mundial volátil y fluctuante. A medida que las comunidades intentan diversificar sus economías, se enfrentan a complejos entornos políticos neoliberales provinciales y federales que ofrecen menos recursos de financiación al tiempo que descargan más responsabilidades en los gobiernos locales. A partir de los estudios de caso de Burns Lake (Columbia Británica) y Grand Falls‐Windsor (Terranova y Labrador) en Canadá, se estudió cómo los pequeños municipios utilizan las empresas municipales para generar ingresos y activos que pueden conducir a nuevas vías económicas. Nuestras conclusiones sugieren que las estrategias empresariales municipales están teniendo un éxito desigual a la hora de romper con las dependencias pasadas del sector forestal. Estos pequeños municipios siguen enfrentándose a riesgos operativos y de desarrollo, así como a debates sobre si utilizar los ingresos para hacer frente a las nuevas responsabilidades municipales y al aumento de la demanda sobre infraestructuras envejecidas y servicios anticuados frente al cambio transformador. 抄録 カナダ全国にある少ないリソースに基づくコミュニティは、不安定で変動するグローバル経済の中で急速な変化を遂げている。コミュニティが経済の多様化を目指す中、少ない財源しか提供せず、しかもより多くの責任を地方政府に転嫁するという州と連邦の複合の新自由主義政策の環境に耐えている。カナダのブリティッシュコロンビア州のバーンズレイクとニューファンドランド・ラブラドール州のグランド・フォールズ=ウィンザーのケーススタディを基に、小規模自治体が自治体企業をどのように利用して、新しい経済経路につながる可能性のある歳入と資産を捻出しているかを検討した。結果から、自治体の起業戦略が、かつての森林部門依存から脱却するために、複合的な成功を生み出していることが示唆される。こうした小さな自治体は、開発や運営のリスクだけでなく、自治体の新しい責任を果たすため、あるいは老朽化したインフラやサービスに対して増加した需要に応えるために歳入を使うべきかどうかと抜本的な変化との議論とも奮闘している。","2023","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","1477-1493","","7","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","municipal entrepreneurialism; path dependency; reform; rural","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this objective, we first of all built a performance evaluation system to understand the relative performance of these trade routes. A questionnaire survey was carried out to reveal the differing views on route performance, and Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was then used to examine and interpret the survey data. Secondly, by dividing the interviewees into two groups, we examined whether the government’s development priorities are at variance with the preferences of industry practitioners. Thirdly, we explored the reasons for the variance by conducting an intensive interview with ten key stakeholders and then explain the findings from the perspective of institutional theories. Finally, we addressed the uncertainty and dynamics of route development under three different scenarios.

We explore the process by which social media affordances interplay with forces of institutional entrepreneurship to create conditions for social change. More specifically we study the adoption in Iran of new business practices and models more commonly seen in other contexts, and relate this to the features of the platforms and the characteristics of a new generation of Iranian entrepreneurs. Drawing on institutional logics theory we conceptualize this process as one of transposition of logics in which dominant religious logics are challenged by market logics enabled by the mutual constitutional effects of human and material agencies. We suggest that three main mechanisms underpin this process: the discovery of practices from different institutional contexts, the appropriation of foreign practices, and the objectification of these practices. The study further contributes to the debate on the paradox of embedded agency and adds to the literature by providing a more integrated view of the role of social media in social change.","2015","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","16-31","","","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Social change; Social media; Institutional logics; Affordances; Importation and transposition of logics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our empirical exploration of the Swiss watchmaking field in its current turbulent causal texture enables us to examine the locus of strategic action (intra-field vs inter-field) by both incumbents and challengers, and how they enact the strategic stances of preparation, relocating and reinventing collaboration. With this lens we also analyse the roles a legacy technology can play in the framing-reframing contention, where incumbents favour an ‘intra-field’ framing (i.e. centred in the legacy technology) whereas challengers favour an ‘inter-field’ reframing (i.e. open to emerging technologies).

The findings show a positive correlation between ESG performance and cash ETRs. The findings are robust to an instrumental variable approach that controls for the potential endogeneity between ESG performance and cash ETRs. For non-financial firms, this positive correlation between ESG performance and cash ETRs is particularly driven by the environmental aspect of ESG performance, whereas it is driven by the social and governance aspects of ESG performance for financial firms. Additional analysis indicates that the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy dimension, which measures a firm’s integration of CSR aspects into its daily decision making, has a positive impact on cash ETRs.

This analysis approaches the issue from the standpoint that a decrease in fossil energy production can proceed more smoothly when mutually supportive interactions between media and energy systems are implemented. This empirical case analysis illuminates one of the intersection nodes between energy and media policies – mediated listening to vulnerable groups hit by the sustainable transition. The author explains how the mode of operation of the news media hinders listening to miners who are losing their jobs. She also explains what may motivate mediated listening and suggests that sustainable energy policy interventions can be designed to create mutually useful interrelations between energy and media systems. The media can gain new audiences during energy system destabilisation, and energy policy implementers can gain insight into the needs of vulnerable groups hit by downsizing.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","101129","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Media; Estonia; Listening; Miners; Russian-speakers; Transitional injustices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We utilize a combined and enriched functional-structural technological innovation system (TIS) analysis to identify systemic problems in the water harvesting TIS in rainfed agricultural production systems of Jordan. Results indicate Jordanian water harvesting TIS development is hindered by three principal blocking mechanisms: 1) inadequate financial resources to support innovation; 2) lack of a common vision across government ministries; 3) institutional problems that inhibit legitimizing the technology. These challenges are caused by interlocking systemic problems, which indicate the need for integrated policy approaches and interventions. Our analysis reinforces the concept that in developing countries, donor interventions should be centrally considered because they play a role in influencing priorities throughout the system and in supporting TIS development. Donors can counteract TIS development and contribute to directionality problems that favor one form of the technology over another, which gives insufficient protection for the water harvesting TIS until markets for technologies form. This would require more effective coordination between different donors’ efforts to develop critical mass in TIS development. We also show that cultural institutions and interactions between formal and informal land tenure laws play a significant role in causing an erosion of trust in the government and counter efforts to promote and engage farming communities in water harvesting activities and innovation. This requires recognition that, in developing countries, informal institutions may have the same status as formal institutions.","2018","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","235-249","","","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Developing countries; Sustainability transitions; Technological innovation systems analysis; Transformational failures; Water harvesting; Water management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach The six-phase model proposed by this study explains the learning processes involving place-based enterprises through two important existing theories: adaptive co-management and Lachmann’s evolutionary, embedded theory of entrepreneurship. The proposed model integrates these two theories on the basis of a longitudinal case study on the fishing enterprises in an Italian marine protected area (MPA). Findings In the case study, the success factors identified by the adaptive co-management literature proved important in enabling an embedded entrepreneurial learning process consistent with Lachmann’s view. The case analysis allowed the authors to cluster these learning processes around six phases. Further, even if traditional fishing is not knowledge-intensive, this case shows the transition to a sustainable business model required intense efforts of educated institutional work and scientific research. Interestingly, the key learning processes were enabled by the emergence of a larger, networked social entity (a network form of organization) including the community of fishermen, the MPA management and a network of scientists studying the marine area ecosystem. Research limitations/implications This study is explorative and relies on a single case study. Despite this limitation, it opens up new research paths in the fields of entrepreneurship, institutional work, network organizations and adaptive management of the commons. Originality/value This study is strongly interdisciplinary; it proposes an original model based on a theoretical view that is highly innovative for organization and management studies; and addresses a relevant but overlooked issue with important societal implications.","2017","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","504-523","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Organizational learning; Entrepreneurial behaviour; Commons; Environmental sustainability; Knowledge co-production; Network organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper uses a framework drawn from the literature on institutional change to analyse the interplay between the formal governance structures and the other actors and organisations that have an influence on public transport, the formal and informal relationships between them, and how informal institutions emerge to increase the effectiveness with which public transport is delivered. By selecting countries with some similarities in institutional structure, it is possible to explore how relationships can differ even within a relatively similar overall framework for public transport. Drawing on qualitative research with actors in the different countries, the research explores how informal institutions help actors negotiate the constraints of formal, statutory institutions. Findings reveal that informal institutions smooth the critical interfaces where formal institutions were producing sub-optimal public transport, thus providing evidence that the two modes of governance are, in fact, highly complementary.","2018","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","196-206","","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Collaboration; Institutions; Governance; Formal; Informal; Organisations; Passenger transport; Public transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study collects and analyzes supply chain data of Chinese A-share listed firms during 2008–2021. We construct an ordinary least squares (OLS) model and perform a cluster-robust estimation with supplier-buyer pairs as clusters. Mechanism analysis identifies two environmental spillover mechanisms—the pushback and technology spillover effects. Moreover, we find a spatial decay pattern in the buyers' DT environmental spillovers. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that such spillovers are more pronounced when suppliers are identified as polluters or when the digitization gap is narrower.

Drawing on several sociological literatures (i.e. the diffusion of institutions, social stratification, and self-fulfilling dynamics), we argue that the current applications of IQ-reflective tests allow individuals with high IQ scores to receive greater access to developmental resources, enabling them to acquire additional capabilities over time, and ultimately perform their jobs better. This institutional explanation for the IQ–job performance link is an alternative to the prevailing assertion that IQ facilitates job performance through on-the-job learning. Further, this explanation suggests that the frequently repeated prescription “select on intelligence” may be institutionally contingent.","2010","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","175-202","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper analyses the potential of rapid, large-scale socio-political change as a window of opportunity for transformative change of natural resources governance. We hypothesize that shocks at higher levels of social organization may open up opportunities for transformation of social-ecological systems into new pathways of development. However, opportunities need to be carefully navigated otherwise transformations may stall or lead the social-ecological system in undesirable directions. We investigate (i) under which circumstances socio-political change has been used by actors as a window of opportunity for initiating transformation towards sustainable natural resource governance, (ii) how the different levels of the systems (landscape, regime and niche) interact to pave the way for initiating such transformations and (iii) which key features (cognitive, structural and agency-related) get mobilized for transformation. This is achieved through analyzing natural resource governance regimes of countries that have been subject to rapid, large-scale political change: water governance in South Africa and Uzbekistan and governance of coastal fisheries in Chile. In South Africa the political and economic change of the end of the apartheid regime resulted in a transformation of the water governance regime while in Uzbekistan after the breakdown of the Soviet Union change both at the economic and political scales and within the water governance regime remained superficial. In Chile the democratization process after the Pinochet era was used to transform the governance of coastal fisheries. The paper concludes with important insight on key capacities needed to navigate transformation towards biosphere stewardship. The study also contributes to a more nuanced view on the relationship between collapse and renewal.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","102097","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this article is to find the contexts in which these capacities appear in strategic documents and planning. Within the framework of the agency perspective, the aim is to indicate the factors affecting the implementation of a resilience strategy, tools and appropriate strategy implementation steps. An analysis of urban adaptation plans and local development strategies of the 45 largest cities in Poland have been conducted. Also, interviews with academics and specialists in the relevant field were carried out. The results demonstrate that urban adaptation plans are too much oriented towards absorptive capacity, whilst local development strategies show little more transformational approach.

Taking a sociological perspective and viewing organizations as cultural systems embedded in wider social contexts, I have developed a multilevel framework addressing institutional, organizational, and individual dimensions shaping decisions on energy efficiency. The framework's development is based on qualitative empirical fieldwork and integrates insights into organizational theory; neo-institutional theory, the attention-based view of the firm, and organizational culture theories. I conclude that decisions on energy efficiency are results of problematization and theorization processes. These processes emerge between the institutional issue-field, the organization, and its members. The model explains decisions shaped by environment (external and material), organizational processes (energy-efficiency practices, climate and culture) and individuals’ characteristics. The framework serves several purposes: introducing a meta-theory of decision making, providing a concept for empirical analysis, and enabling connectivity to the research on barriers.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","101314","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Organizational culture; Attention-based theory of the firm; Industrial energy efficiency; Neo-institutional theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we explore the implementation of an industrial R&D project, focusing in particular upon the role of means-ends decoupling work to understand how the goals are managed. We combine several data sources in our case research to explore project implementation through an understanding of means-ends decoupling work. We collected in-depth interviews, archival records and field observations within the R&D research setting of an industrial R&D project in the period of 2015 to 2017. Our findings identify three types of means-ends decoupling work in R&D project implementation: ‘work on’ causal complexity, ‘work at’ behavioural invisibility, and ‘work with’ practice multiplicity. In addition, we uncover six dynamic micro-mechanisms that collectively influence the making and nature of means-ends decoupling work and therefore serve to allow for the fluid switching of work as the institutional conditions permit. Overall, our findings have significant implications for understanding means-ends decoupling as a highly skilled network competence for managing R&D project implementation goals.","2019","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","296-311","","","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional theory; Implementation; Industrial R&D projects; Means-ends decoupling; Micro-mechanisms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hierarchical clustering characterises an intermediate-level mechanism. Findings In each country, a small number of patterns emerge, two of which are found in every country studied – despite the large cultural differences.

However, there are many social barriers in subsistence contexts that exclude vulnerable groups from participating in, and benefiting from, the shared value creation process. These social barriers are contextual in nature and arise from sources such as gender-based discrimination or caste-based discrimination. The exclusion of such vulnerable groups undermines the goal of inclusive social innovation and sparks concerns of elite-capture of shared value in subsistence marketplaces. In this paper, we highlight how social enterprises can overcome the concern of elite-capture of shared value by fostering inclusive social innovation in subsistence contexts. Our research draws from a longitudinal inductive study of nine Indian social enterprises operating in industrial markets such as agriculture and logistics. We apply and extend insights from institutional work perspective to uncover three principal mechanisms for fostering inclusive social innovation, namely – a) relational work, b) inclusion work and c) equity work. These mechanisms work in concert to facilitate the a) creation of shared value in subsistence contexts, b) inclusive distribution of shared value, and c) fair distribution of shared value.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","21-34","","","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Poverty; Elite capture; Inclusive social innovation; Subsistence marketplaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach We gathered cross-sectional data from 266 Japanese new venture owners running their businesses across a variety of sectors and empirically examined whether, how and when legitimacy positively affects new ventures' performance by employing the SPSS PROCESS macro for moderated mediation analysis. Findings The results indicate that rich access to a pool of valuable resources fully mediates the positive effects of legitimacy on new venture growth. Furthermore, this study offers robust empirical evidence that prior entrepreneurial experience and competitive intensity as the internal and external contingency factors significantly moderate the indirect effect of legitimacy on new venture growth through resource accessibility. Research limitations/implications Although our analysis provides clear support for the view that important resources for new venture performance are gained through legitimacy, it does not offer precise clarifications for the type and sources of legitimacy and for the strategies that could be deployed to achieve legitimacy. Future studies should clearly distinguish tangible assets (e.g. financial resources) from intangible assets (e.g. tacit knowledge, networks and reputation) in terms of resource accessibility. Therefore, it should be worth scrutinizing the multiple dimensions of resources as potential mediators of the legitimacy-new venture growth relationship in greater depth. Practical implications From a policy perspective, this study suggests that a special emphasis needs to be placed on designing and carrying out policies aimed at increasing the visibility and credibility of entrepreneurship as a positive career path since public acceptance of entrepreneurship is essential to new venture growth. Furthermore, it is logical to conclude that achieving greater legitimacy is a pivotal strategic tool not only to overcome resource barriers but also to maximize a probability of survival, specifically for those entrepreneurs without prior experience and those operating in a fiercely competitive market environment. Originality/value Unlike previous studies that have mostly presented the direct effect of entrepreneurial legitimacy on venture outcomes (Capelleras et al., 2019; Kibler and Kautonen, 2016; Pindado and Sánchez, 2017), our research empirically identified the potential complexities inherent in this relationship by performing a conditional indirect effect analysis.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","427-447","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Japan; New venture growth; Internal and external contingencies; Perceived legitimacy; Resource accessibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need for a definition that encompasses a complex matrix of characteristics, inclusive of positive and negative aspects, which are not necessarily industry or sector specific. Whilst megaprojects have often been described and defined in terms of cost, they are more accurately delineated by their convolutions. Intricacies arise from political intrigues surrounding funding of such projects and managing and governing complex social and organizational relations. Points for future research are also identified. Design/methodology/approach An analysis of international megaproject literature over the past five years combined with seminal works was undertaken, drawing on the broad literature of project and program management combined with elements of organizational theory. Whilst some examples are cited, in-depth case analysis has not been covered. Findings Albeit that the scale of some megaprojects is comparable to national GDPs, seven more characteristics beyond size have been identified, which distinguish megaprojects from large projects. These include: reach; duration; risks and uncertainties; widely disparate actors; areas of controversy such as dispute resolution; and legal and regulatory issues. Research limitations/implications The paper takes a broad overview and whilst some examples are cited, in-depth case analysis has not been covered. The overview does however provide a good synopsis of the future research areas that warrant exploration. Practical implications The paper identifies a range of analytical areas for major future research including further exploration of institutional analysis. Areas for further analysis include stakeholder issues; collaboration and understanding between technical and business personnel and reforming notions of procurement and contractual arrangements. Social implications Rigorous stakeholder engagement is critical for success in megaprojects, and collaborative learnings need to be exchanged. The longer term social and economic impacts need to be viewed as an imperative rather than a hindrance to the planning and execution of megaprojects and complexity rather than cost more aptly defines megaprojects. Originality/value The paper moves the definition of megaprojects to beyond measurement on the basis of cost to complexity and social and economic variables.","2018","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","7-34","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innovation; Social; Economic; Megaprojects; Characteristics; Complexity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article seeks to understand the current state of impact evaluation practice in the development field by examining standard-setting documents intended to guide the behavior of entities involved in development assistance. We explore these standards as representations of institutional logics that encode current norms, practices, and expectations for these actors and examine the extent to which impact evaluation norms and practices are enshrined within these standard-setting documents. To do so, we examine guidance from a diverse set of 42 standards to better understand how evaluation is conceptualized and what standards are being articulated. We find both convergence and divergence in the institutional logics employed and in how evaluation norms and practices are incorporated into standards. We see convergence in the adoption of a normative, process-oriented logic that appears across many entities in the widely articulated commitment to practices such as information sharing, participation, and listening. We find more divergence in the adoption of a results-oriented logic that implies a commitment to impact evaluation. These distinct logics give rise to two discrete discourses: an “evaluation generalist” discourse that conceptualizes evaluation in broad terms and an “impact centric” discourse that articulates a more comprehensive set of principles emphasizing causal attribution. We suggest that structural characteristics and positionality in the aid system may help explain the adoption of different institutional logics and associated evaluation practices.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","105596","","","146","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional logics; Aid; Codes of conduct and standard-setting programs; Impact evaluation; Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in computing and telecommunications technology are dramatically transforming this landscape by changing the way the financial industry operates. A key mechanism underlying this transformation concerns the use of big data in assessing, evaluating and refining the creditworthiness of potential borrowers and reducing the transaction costs. While China’s internet-only banking industry is currently small and some activities of players in this industry are akin to those in the shadow banking, this industry has potential to cause a major disruption in the Chinese financial market. A main objective of this paper is to examine the role of big data in facilitating the access to financial products for economically active low-income families and micro-enterprises in China. A second objective is to investigate how formal and informal institutions facilitate and constrain the use of big data in the Chinese financial industry and market. The paper also investigates how various inherent characteristics of big data – volume, velocity, variety, variability and complexity – are related to the assessment of the creditworthiness of low-income families and micro-enterprises. Case studies of big data deployment in the Chinese financial industry and market are discussed. The paper also looks at various categories of personal financial and non-financial information that are being used as proxy measures for a potential borrower’s identity, ability to repay and willingness to repay. Various business models involving the sources of data (internal vs. external to the big data organization) and providers of credits (big data organization vs. external partners or clients of the big data organization) are investigated. The analysis of the paper indicates that the main reason why low-income families and micro-enterprises in China and other emerging economies lack access to financial services is not because they lack creditworthiness but merely because banks and financial institutions lack data, information and capabilities to access the creditworthiness of and effectively provide financial services to this financial disadvantaged group.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","297-308","","3","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","China; Internet of things; Big data; Emerging economies; Creditworthiness; Information opacity; Shadow banking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas the total number of self-initiated expatriates has hugely increased in Japan, the high turnover rate is a big issue. Can this also be evidenced with new data? How does the Japanese HR system, with its notorious reputation for unique people management methods, relate to the expats' reasons for staying in the long or short term? Design/methodology/approach Replication of research is adopted here with an interview-based qualitative method using the same research design as previous literature. The previous research focused on Chinese and Vietnamese self-initiated expatriates, who occupy the majority of expatriate positions in Japan. This study has a new target group of Thai expatriates, who have a relatively higher educational background than some other expatriates and are expected by the Japanese firms to stay over the long term. Findings Replication of the findings of the latest studies occurs in this research. The turnover rate is as high as other national expatiates, with similar reasons, related to the Japanese HR system. However, there are also different issues. The main reasons they give for not staying in the long-term are unhealthy work habits, followed by slower promotion and ambiguous work content/role. The Japanese HR system is a dehumanising mechanism leading to a stressful work environment, which is the most critical concern for them and the main reason they choose not to remain in the long term. Originality/value Past studies indicate an expectation gap between Japanese firms and expatriates, which is also found in this study. Additionally, an assumption gap between them about security under the HR system is also confirmed. Security means working healthily for expatriates while it means long-term employment for Japanese firms.","2023","2025-07-26 06:53:29","2025-07-26 06:53:29","","388-410","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Japanese firms; Japanese HR system; Self-initiated expatriates; Thai employees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assurance level provided should differently impact potential investors’ willingness to invest in a new venture and need for additional information during due diligence evaluation of the organization and entrepreneur. Design/methodology/approach To examine the relative effects of the signal provided by these levels of assurance on investment decisions, a survey is administered to collect data regarding an investment-related decision scenario. The three levels of assurance in independent accountant’s reports (audit, review or compilation) is manipulated when eliciting participants’ responses. Findings Results indicate that respondents perceive the signal provided by compilation reports, review reports and audit reports as increasing in reliability and are more likely to invest in a venture providing reports with that increasing reliability. Audited financial statements are viewed as the most reliable and provide a positive signal to potential investors and lenders. Consequently, potential investors may require less additional information from entrepreneurs with audited financial statements when conducting due diligence investigations.

A key feature of innovation systems are system resources - collective structures such as common standards, support programs, shared expectations or testing facilities all actors can use. System resources emerge either uncoordinated or as a result of strategic action by ‘system builders’. In this paper we explore the conditions of system building. Taking a strategy perspective, we analyze how system building depends on resource constellations at a certain point in time. Drawing from research in the field of stationary fuel cells in Germany, we identify three generic modes, of system building: a) the “single mode”, in which a system builder uses its own organizational resources to create a system resource, b) the “partner mode”, in which a system builder joins forces with partners in order to co-create system resources, and c) the “intermediary mode”, in which a system builder collaborates with other actors to set up an intermediary organization, which then works towards the creation of system resources. We show that the modes were chosen depending on i) what resources were initially available and ii) how they were distributed in the innovation system. Our paper contributes to a more differentiated understanding of system building in the TIS literature and beyond.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","119209","","","153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innovation management; Technological innovation system; System building; Resource constellations; Stationary fuel cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, our analysis offers insight into the counterbalancing role of reflexivity, operating at both individual and collective levels of analysis, in generating the ability of entrepreneurs to overcome the constraints of imprinting. These insights are based on a thematic review of the nine studies that comprise this special issue on qualitative research.

We consider that culture plays an important role when young people decide to develop a new business idea. Therefore, we conducted our research in two culturally different nations: Puerto Rico, which belongs to the Anglo-Saxon group, and Spain, which belongs to the Mediterranean group. Data for this study were collected from 791 undergraduate business management students. The results show a greater entrepreneurial culture in Puerto Rico, except for the fear of entrepreneurship factor, where the scores are similar in both countries. Sex and age influence self-perception of entrepreneurial culture. However, this self-perception in Puerto Rican students is only influenced by training courses on entrepreneurship-related skills, while in Spain, it is impacted by students’ having done extracurricular internships and not having participated in international work teams. The influence of the Dunning-Kruger effect and cultural, economic and social characteristics could be important. This study has relevant implications for universities and for institutional policy-making. It is imperative to design and adapt educational programmes to improve the self-perception of entrepreneurship culture and thus align with students' needs and aspirations for higher quality entrepreneurship.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","101172","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innovation; Entrepreneurial; University students; Business students; Entrepreneurial culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessment initiatives have begun to develop as a proxy measure of social sustainable supply chain management. This research aims to examine how social sustainability assessment initiatives instigate and use institutional pressures to drive third-party accreditation as the legitimate means of demonstrating social sustainability in a global supply chain. Design/methodology/approach Ten assessment initiatives focused on assuring social sustainability across supply chains are examined. Data are collected through interviews with senior managers and publicly available secondary material. Findings The findings show how the social sustainability assessment initiatives act by instigating institutional pressures indirectly rather than directly. Coercive pressures are the most prevalent and are exerted through consumer and compliance requirements. The notion of pressures operating as a chain is proposed, and the recognition that actors within and outside of a supply chain are crucial to the institutionalization of social sustainability is discussed. Originality/value Studies on sustainable supply chain management often focus on how companies sense and act upon institutional pressures.

Through case studies of Rennes Métropole, the Communauté d'agglomération Paris-Saclay, and Dassault Systèmes—two French intermunicipal authorities and a global software firm—this paper conceptualizes CDTs as “urban laboratory projects” that aim to performatively enact cities as sites for technological innovation. Yet, as entrepreneurial actors use CDTs to showcase innovative self-narratives, advancing these projects locally requires the negotiated ‘enrolment’ of various organizational partners. In these interactions, entrepreneurs flexibilize the definitions of their projects in order to adaptat to institutional obduracy. This is found to be a recursive cycle in which flexibility and stability in the organization of urban networks are self-reinforcing. While urban laboratory projects like the CDT may support the advancement of a certain 'innovative' symbolic order, the interaction between (1) flexible project definitions and experimental relationships on the one hand and (2) stable institutions and sustained narratives on the other often produces ephemeral experiences over lasting infrastructural or institutional change. The study finds that the enactment of the urban laboratory reinforces a “sandbox” approach to urban governance in which projects are constantly renewed but never completed. Through a discussion of this ‘sandbox urbanism,’ the research offers a critical view of the social entropy generated by the laboratorization of urban governance.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","106261","","","166","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Smart city; Digital twin; Sandbox urbanism; Sociology of innovation; Urban governance; Urban laboratory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From evolutionary economic geography (EEG), scholars have emphasized the processes underlying the formation of new energy paths in energy system transitions. These processes have been well studied in Global North countries, but insights into the processes shaping the energy transition in sub-Saharan Africa are still limited. This study provides a contribution to fill that gap by exploring the emerging energy paths in Senegal through the lens of EEG, using the framework of regional path creation processes to analyze qualitative interview data from 17 experts in the Senegalese energy sector. Senegal is an instructive country to study, as its energy sector is undergoing substantial reform that has accelerated the deployment of large-scale renewable energy projects in recent years. The study uncovers three parallel evolving energy paths stemming from path transplantation, indigenous path creation, and path upgrading. Each path differs greatly in its legitimation and in the role of institutions as enablers. These results not only contribute to the ongoing scientific debate; but also provide insights for development agencies, national and regional institutions, NGOs and private actors involved in the Senegalese energy system.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","102771","","","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Renewable energies; Legitimation; Energy transition; Path creation processes; Senegal; Sub-Saharan Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to the relation that can exist between the spatial context and the entrepreneurial activities. Specifically, institutions and the space of entrepreneurial activities in a country have rarely been considered as a whole. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between these two aspects and seeks to examine the entrepreneurial activity in rural areas in comparison with urban areas based on the formal and informal institutions in an emerging economy such as Colombia. It claims that the formal institutions affect rural and urban entrepreneurs differently, examining the moderating effect of the informal institutions on this relation. Using a hierarchical logic model with panel data, 30 cities in Colombia over the period 2000–2013 are used as samples to explore the differences between rural and urban areas. It is found that the informal institutions achieve greater influence in the rural areas; these areas are favored to a greater extent by the social norms, since they are smaller territories with greater integration between citizens. However, the existence of subjective and objective insecurity affects rural entrepreneurial activity in a wider scope than urban entrepreneurial activity, decreasing the creation of new ventures.","2019","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","458-471","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Entrepreneurship; Formal and informal institutions; Rural areas; Urban areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by positioning theory, which has its roots in symbolic interactionism, we analyse how positions are invoked in the actors’ various actions and statements (‘speech acts’) and how they draw from the mutually constructed narratives (‘storylines’) that enable and constrain the range of possible positions. We analyse, over time, the positioning of three Dutch systemic intermediaries in agriculture, energy production, and healthcare.

Filling those voids has been widely identified as a strategy for businesses and in this paper we analyse the institutional actions of digital platform companies. Specifically and through primary research, we analyse the impact of e-hailing platforms (Uber, Bolt and EasyTaxi) in Colombia and South Africa on ride-hailing markets characterised by institutional voids. Alongside the void-filling discussed in the literature, we identify three other institutional strategies of these businesses: they also maintain and expand and create institutional voids. The platform companies’ institutional work has formed a market that is more efficient, effective, complete and formalised.

What is required is system change, namely, transformations in policy, practice, power relationships, market dynamics and social customs that underlie social and environmental issues. Technological innovations, paired with intentional social changes, might play a transformative role in this effort. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the adoption of technologies in social enterprises (SEs) and their contribution to achieving system change. It also addresses the effects of their hybrid nature on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach The analysis relied on data collected through a survey of the global population of Ashoka fellows, which is largely based in emerging economies. Three models were developed concerning different pathways to achieve system change identified in the theoretical framework. These were tested using Probit regressions. Findings The investigation confirms that technology can support SEs in navigating complex pathways to achieve system change rather than merely enabling linear scaling operational strategies. The pursuit of economic value creation, in conjunction with a social mission, decreases the ability of SEs to achieve system change. This is because the scaling paths which hardly create revenues are neglected. Originality/value The study conceptualises a multifaceted model of system change. It tests the framework empirically to show that SEs can adopt technologies to unleash complex system change processes to generate societal impact, on top of merely demonstrating linear approaches to scaling or replication. The paper questions the capacity of SEs to facilitate system change without appropriate financial support and the inherent tensions between hybridity and the depth of system change dynamics.","2024","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","156-186","","7","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sustainable development; Technology adoption; Hybrid organisations; Social enterprises; System change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study of one of the best-ranked early adopters of PMM in a local government in Indonesia was undertaken, with interviews with public officers at various organisational levels, along with an extensive documentary review. An institutional work perspective was used to explain the types of work undertaken to institutionalise PMM at the organisation. Findings The PMM change was shown to be centralised and directed from the top and facilitated by other public officers. The Mayors’ instrumental and political view of PMM as a tool for efficiency and societal legitimacy enabled the adoption of PMM. The political and cultural work of the Mayor and the key officers involved constructing new rules pertaining to PMM, specifically in dealing with resource allocation and its associated sanctions and rewards, which encouraged more substantive implementation. The substantive implementation of PMM had a significant influence on the norms and values of the local government. Research limitations/implications The case organisation is the local government of a relatively medium-sized city. Therefore, it may be easier to achieve tighter control and coordination as compared to the local government of other larger cities. Originality/value The paper highlights the interrelated nature of institutional work in the creation and disruption of institutions. In addition, the three main types of institutional work, i.e. political, cultural and technical work, are not mutually exclusive.

We explore two contrasting empirical case studies of national organic trajectories: Uganda and Benin. In both countries, organic agriculture emerged in the 1980s around food security stakes and spread in the 1990s through certified export value chains, with a faster development in Uganda than in Benin. From a theoretical perspective, this paper proposes an original analytical grid to study national trajectories of institutionalization of organic farming in Africa, based on three main variables: the policy regime in place in the country (including socio-economic and agrifood dimensions); the relative interest of public and private foreign actors in organic agriculture; and the strength of the national organic agriculture movement. Our results show that the degree of institutionalization of the Green Revolution paradigm in the country is of capital importance for explaining developments in organic farming, particularly its materialization through the increasing use of synthetic inputs: institutionalizing organic farming means deinstitutionalizing agrochemicals. We also show that the high level of extraversion of organic agriculture development in Africa through its focus on certified export value chains raises long-term questions of farmers' empowerment and of local consumers/citizens' access to local organic food. Finally, national organic agriculture movements can play a crucial role by politicizing certain issues in national public debate, such as pesticides' impacts on human and environmental health, and by advising governments in organic policy framing and implementation. Applying the proposed socio-political analytical grid to new national or regional African case studies will help to further enrich the empirical knowledge on organic food and farming in Africa.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","110-121","","","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutionalization; Benin; Organic; Pesticides; Politicization; Uganda","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Responding to this call, this paper employs Bourdieu’s theory of practice to investigate entrepreneurship in two UK cities: Liverpool and Kingston upon Hull (Hull). By adopting an abductive approach, we shed light on shared practical understandings and multi-practitioner entrepreneurial activities. Using the concept of a 'field of entrepreneurship' to elucidate entrepreneurial contexts, our study reveals the dynamics within these settings that encourage agents to engage in entrepreneurial endeavours. In Liverpool, an autonomizing process is observed, wherein agents are drawn into entrepreneurship due to factors such as perceived social capital, ease of access, and adherence to a self-help doxa or ethos. Conversely, in Hull, perceived low entrepreneurial activity prompts agents to form formal alliances and initiatives to bolster the entrepreneurial landscape, leading to a distinct form of homological alliance-building. This research brings a unique empirical application of practice theory to the study of entrepreneurship and context, offering insights into the interplay between agency and structure. By uncovering shared practices facilitating entrepreneurial activities across different contexts, our findings enrich our understanding of entrepreneurial dynamics and inform strategies for fostering entrepreneurship.","2025","2025-07-26 06:53:30","2025-07-26 06:53:30","","101393","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Social capital; Autonomizing process; Bourdieusian theory of practice; Doxa; Entrepreneurial habitus; Entrepreneurship and context; Field of entrepreneurship and field dynamics; Homological activity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By adopting a market approach, this study aims to develop a framework showing how social enterprises in tourism/hospitality can generate social value and transformation. Design/methodology/approach A thorough literature review revealed that a market approach is an appropriate lens for understanding social entrepreneurship. Consequently, a framework based on “learning with the market” is proposed as a useful tool for identifying, managing and also creating (new) opportunities for social ventures. The justification and the theoretical underpinnings of the market-based framework are further supported by discussing various other theories and concepts. Findings The framework identifies three capabilities that social entrepreneurs need to develop for generating social value and transformation: network structure, market practices and market pictures. Several examples from tourism and hospitality social enterprises are analyzed for showing the applicability and usefulness of the framework. Research limitations/implications The paper proposes a conceptual framework as well as several research directions for further testing, refining and expanding it. Practical implications By applying the framework on several tourism and hospitality social enterprises, the paper provides practical implications about the capabilities that social enterprises should develop for engaging with other market actors to identify and exploit (new) market opportunities for social value co-creation, and influence market plasticity for forming new markets and driving social change.

This article provides a much needed examination of the interaction between institutional contexts and agency in self-initiated global careers. It advances the understanding of how self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) are influenced by and engage institutions in constructing their global mobility and careers. The research is a field-based study of SIEs’ encounters with the institutions of a Nordic welfare state and consists of interviews, observations, and document analyses. It makes a relevant addition to understanding how the self-directed expatriation of highly skilled professionals is institutionally moderated. It expands knowledge by showing how SIEs engage and potentially aim to influence public institutions and discourses to further their global mobility and work experiences and by providing a differentiated and distributed view of agency in self-initiated expatriation. While institutional environments condition global mobility and work experiences, they are potentially also influenced by the global talent that flows through them.","2014","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","903-915","","6","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Expatriation; Institution; Boundaryless career; Global career; Highly skilled professionals; Self-initiated expatriation; Talent; Welfare state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We document strong positive entrepreneurial effects of local human capital resources and market size as well as market integration and human capital spillovers from mega-urban agglomerations of integrated cities. Our estimates point to an elasticity of innovation-driven entrepreneurship with respect to human capital spillovers of 0.50–0.79. The elasticity with respect to market integration is 0.53–0.89. Our results also suggest heterogeneous human capital spillover and market integration effects across urban agglomerations. These effects are more robust in first-tier urban agglomerations because first-tier urban agglomerations have a stronger economic base and greater connectivity. Strong human capital spillover and large gains from access to surrounding economic mass jointly highlight the integrated development of mega-urban agglomerations in China.

While there is a growing interest in making transformative change in LFS, the area lacks a solid theoretical foundation to address how change processes in food systems occur. In this study, a classic Glaserian grounded theory methodology was used to investigate LFS planning. The primary goal was the development of theory grounded in the experience of practitioners, elected officials, and members of the public all having some level of experience with LFS initiatives. The data are drawn from interviews with 29 elected officials, public stakeholders, and planning staff working in five communities with LFS planning initiatives. In addition, 10 member checking interviews were conducted to determine the fit and relevance of the findings to the experience of participants in LFS planning. The emergent theory of ‘Transformative Incrementalism’ (TI), was developed from this research to describe the social processes underlying planning initiatives to achieve transformative change in LFS. Consistent with grounded theory principles, the core category identified in the theory was Power, while Values, Praxis, and Outcomes were other main themes. TI suggests that change is achieved through a long process of incremental efforts by actors within the public, political, and bureaucratic groups to achieve convergence and align values and beliefs over time.","2019","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","100424","","","134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classic grounded theory; Local food systems; Power; Praxis; Transformative change; Values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus of most has been on the development of technological innovations which create economic value.However, addressing macro-level societal problems – sociotechnical and environmental challengesin which the production, dissemination and use of social and technical knowledge and technology can potentially resolve the problem – has been overlooked. The present study argues that in order to resolve such problems, a combination of technical innovations (covering the technological aspects of the problem) and social innovations (covering the social aspects of the problem) are required.Instead of focusing on the development of a particular technology or industry, an innovation system must focus on solving problems; it must utilize technical innovations alongside economic and social innovations to do so.To this end, the present study highlights the need for a framework for the analysis of macro-level societal problems by reviewing innovation systems literature and proposes a new approach named “Problem-oriented innovation systems”. We conceptualize this approach based on event history analysis and through case study of the US air pollution problem and the way it was successfully resolved by using technical and social innovations.The results show that a problem-oriented innovation system has eight functions: System monitoring and guidance, technical and social knowledge creation, technical and social entrepreneurship, knowledge dissemination, collaboration and synergy, public awareness, standardization and resource mobilization. Finally, a framework for analyzing the innovation process is proposed to solve the macro-level societal problem. This approach can be used to solve global problems such as global warming and climate change which ask for collaboration among different countries.","2020","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","119749","","","150","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technological innovation; Air pollution problem; Macro level societal problems; PIS functions; Problem-oriented Innovation System; Social innovation; Socio-technical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary data from public archives and oral history interviews, combined with secondary sources, are drawn upon to explain the failure of this proposed merger and to consider its legacy. The complementary theoretical perspectives of “boundary-work” and “institutional work” are applied. Amidst other challenges, corporate collapses during the 1960s precipitated a legitimacy crisis for the profession and raised the prospect of there being sufficient commonality of purpose to enable a merger. While there was overwhelming support from Society members, the merger proposal was defeated by a comprehensive “no” vote from Institute members. This pattern of voting was repeated in three subsequent merger attempts, leading to the persistence of the curious binary structure of the Australian accounting profession and associated ongoing differences and tensions.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","100975","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutional work; Australian accounting profession; Australian Society of Accountants; Boundary-work; Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia; Professional association mergers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies have highlighted the need to maintain and build manufacturing capabilities to support economic growth and have linked a nation's as well as region's strength in manufacturing to its ability to innovate. In the U.S., where a manufacturing strategy has largely been absent for the past 25years, advanced manufacturing capabilities are now seen as essential to the development of new products and processes across a range of industries. Against this backdrop, Massachusetts presents an interesting case since manufacturing in this U.S. state is integral to several of its most important industry clusters, yet it is a high wage, high costs state that must compete globally. This research examines the pathways and opportunities for building and fostering innovation capacity among Massachusetts manufacturers, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We employ a systems approach to conduct analytic and empirical analyses that consider how knowledge and sources of innovation flow between key participants within the manufacturing innovation ecosystem. We find that the Massachusetts manufacturing innovation ecosystem is rich in terms of assets but relatively poor in terms of interconnectedness between those assets. In addition, rather than being focused on demand-driven innovation and technological upgrading for SMEs, non-market state-supported manufacturing intermediaries are primarily focused on supply-side, point solutions that work with individual firms rather than at a systems level.","2018","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","178-191","","","136","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innovation; Advanced manufacturing; Massachusetts; Regional innovation ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We contribute to filling this gap by reviewing the German energy transition (Energiewende), which targets a competitive low-carbon economy until 2050, jointly from the three perspectives of technology, actors and institutions. We analyze seven sub-fields of the electricity system that are central for decarbonization from a technology view. For each, we identify and characterize key actors and institutional conditions for future electricity infrastructure developments they favor. The analysis reveals a large variety of engaged actors that differ with respect to their motives and underlying worldviews. Electricity infrastructure visions range from the archetypes of decentralized regional solutions (favored by challengers) to centralized European solutions (favored by incumbents). We illustrate that the determining factors for both developments are primarily of institutional nature and will be fought out between actors in the political arena. From a technology perspective centralized and decentralized solutions may well coexist to a certain degree. However, in either case the long latency period in technical infrastructure development requires anticipatory planning.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","263-275","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Energy transition; Electricity infrastructure; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Strategic action fields","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent work in attempting to address this has focused through a S-D logic lens on the reciprocal nature of value propositions. Important to this work has been a focus on communicative interactions and resource integration between network suppliers and customers. Overall, value proposition thinking has not studied in detail their adoption and use in practice. Considering the compelling notion of reciprocity, there have been recent calls for research to consider reciprocal value propositions in practice. The overall aim of this paper, therefore, was to explore how reciprocal value propositions are developed (or not) in practice at the network level. The study was set in the mobile television (TV) sector, which, as an internet-driven sector, is viewed as particularly pertinent. To conduct the study an S-D logic and Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Group framework are integrated for the first time. A key finding is that while the reciprocal value proposition concept is theoretically intuitive, it is by no means inevitable in practice. Reciprocal value propositions were found to be simultaneously constrained, and, potentially enabled by these constraints in practice. At an overall level this paper contributes to the ongoing collaborative process, which aims to move S-D logic from a framework to a theory. More specifically, we provide new insights into the development of reciprocal value propositions in practice.","2012","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","197-206","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial marketing; Reciprocal value; Service-dominant logic; Value; Value co-creation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on data from the annual Higher Education Business and Community Interaction survey for the years 2007–2012, this paper empirically explores the relationship between a range of Third Mission activities by university KTO and performance of three key business-community services – provision of consultancy, provision of continuous professional development courses (CPD), and leasing of facilities and equipment (FE). It emerges that the routines of developing strategic plan and creating spin-off are positively associated with all types of community knowledge transfer (CKT) activities.

This study draws on more than a century of communications in a Dutch cooperative bank to uncover how a major organizational unit enacted distinct discursive strategies to seek internal legitimacy. The paper extends prior work by showing how internal legitimacy work – the efforts to shape, reinforce, or suppress internal legitimacy judgments – in a hybrid organization is a dynamic process whereby an internal unit generates multiple complementary narratives to promote a fit between its own attributes and the legitimacy evaluations by internal audiences. In addition, it shows how internal legitimacy work can promote this fit by attempting to manipulate not only the impressions of the internal unit's attributes, but also its audiences’ understanding of wider cultural norms of the day, on which their legitimacy judgments are based. In this vein, the paper highlights how discursive internal legitimacy work seeks to generate a taken-for-granted organizational position for the internal units concerned.","2022","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","102162","","5","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Content analysis; Cooperative; Discourse; Internal legitimacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the outward FDI from Latin America is more likely to be located in geographically proximate countries and in countries with similar culture and language than that from their OECD counterparts. We also show that Latin American outward FDI is less likely to be resource seeking. This presumably reflects the rich natural resource endowments and agricultural potential in major Latin American countries. Further, outward FDI from Latin America is more likely to be concentrated in countries with a similar corruption environment than that from their OECD counterparts. This might indicate a broadly similar nature of corruption across Latin America due to shared cultural, political and economic legacies.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","101853","","5","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Latin America; International comparison; Locational determinants; OECD; Outward FDI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It commences with a personalised account of the first named author’s experiences of behavioural, social and critical accounting in the 25 years before MAR appeared. This covers events in the UK, especially the Management Control Workshop, Management Accounting Research conferences at Aston, the Inter-disciplinary Perspectives on Accounting Conferences; key departments and professors; and elsewhere the formation of pan-European networks, and reflections on a years’ visit to the USA. Papers published by MAR are analysed according to year of publication, country of author and research site, research method, research subject (type of organization or subject studied), data analysis method, topic, and theory. This revealed, after initial domination by UK academics, increasing Continental European influence; increasing use of qualitative methods over a wide range of topics, especially new costing methods, control system design, change and implementation, public sector transformation, and more recently risk management and creativity. Theoretical approaches have been diverse, often multi-disciplinary, and have employed surprisingly few economic theories relative to behavioural and social theories. The research spans mainly large public and private sector organisations especially in Europe. Seven themes perceived as of interest to a social and critical theory analysis are evaluated, namely: the search for ‘Relevance Lost’ and new costing; management control, the environment and the search for ‘fits’; reconstituting the public sector; change and institutional theory; post-structural, constructivist and critical contributions; social and environmental accounting; and the changing geography of time and space between European and American research. The paper concludes by assessing the contributions of MAR against the aspirations of groups identified in the opening personal historiography, which have been largely met. MAR has made substantial contributions to social and critical accounting (broadly defined) but not in critical areas endeavouring to give greater voice and influence to marginalised sectors of society worldwide. Third Sector organisations, politics, civil society involvement, development and developing countries, labour, the public interest, political economy, and until recently social and environmental accounting have been neglected.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","10-30","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accounting; Theory; Management; Review; Practice; Critical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In various European countries, SF enjoys an advanced stage of development, social visibility, and institutional support. In Catalonia, SF is still in its early stages, an innovation that is progressively becoming consolidated and serving as an instrument to facilitate sustainable territorial development. This article provides an analysis of the status quo and the dynamics of SF in Catalonia, as the first objective, where there has been little study of this phenomenon, based on the creation of a database of existing projects, in-depth interviews with those who manage the entities and an analysis of the sector's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) based on the information collected during the field research.

While African governments view this growth as a positive development for the continent, many governments in the West have raised concerns regarding the institutional impact of investments from developing economies. This paper examines the impact of FDI flows on institutional quality in African countries by distinguishing investments from developed versus developing economies. Previous empirical studies have found a significant relationship between FDI flows and institutional quality in African countries but regard the relationship as MNEs rewarding African countries for adopting institutional reforms. However, little attention has been paid to the reverse causality, i.e. that FDI can cause an institutional change in African countries. Using bilateral greenfield FDI flows between 56 countries during 2003−2015, we find no significant FDI effect from developed and developing economies on institutional quality in host countries. However, aggregate FDI flows from developed and developing economies have a significant positive effect on host country institutional quality but differ concerning the impact's timing. In contrast, we find no significant effect of FDI flows from China on host country institutional quality. Our results are robust to alternative measures of institutional quality.","2021","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","101835","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institutions; Co-evolution; Multinational enterprises; Foreign direct investment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared different entry strategies of different types of care farmers: varying in weak and strong multi-functionality, the degree of legitimacy and background of the initiator. Our objective is to provide insight into the key factors contributing to the development and success of care farms, in particular by focusing on the role of entrepreneurship, commitment and the ability to cope with barriers in the environment. We developed a framework based on entrepreneurship and opportunity structure. We interviewed different types of care farmers. Many of them were farmers' spouses with prior experience in the care sector. Entrepreneurship and the local and national opportunity structure, like (changes in) financing regulations, interact and explain the accessibility and growth potential of care farms. Pioneers in the emerging care farming sector faced a lack of cognitive and sociopolitical legitimacy and a mismatch with incumbent financing structures. Initially, they only succeeded with sufficient levels of entrepreneurial behavior and commitment. Having a professional background and network in the care sector was helpful in the starting phase. Later entrants experienced more legitimacy and fewer barriers as financing regulations had changed. They had different entry options: being independent or under supervision of a care organization or a regional support organization of care farms. For this latter option, newcomer problems were solved by established care organizations. However, there was a risk of becoming too dependent on established care organizations. Initiatives with weak multi-functionality failed more often than initiatives with strong multi-functionality due to unrealistic expectations and limited commitment on the part of initiators.","2016","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","27-39","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Entrepreneurship; Multifunctional agriculture; Legitimacy; Opportunity structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conflict and disagreement are recognized as part of legitimation processes; however, scholarship emphasizes consensus-building over contestation. Moreover, as legitimacy processes are always ongoing and never final, such contestation can persist even in legitimated fields. We bring together Baumann's (2007) general theory of artistic legitimation and field theories (Bourdieu, 1993; Fligstein & McAdam, 2012) in order to develop an approach to artistic legitimacy that accounts for conflict and contestation as much as consensus in legitimacy processes. We use a historical case study to build theory on legitimacy struggles in aesthetic fields. Specifically, we examine the legitimation of Outsider art, an aesthetic field defined as work by artists who produce outside established art worlds and who come from disadvantaged social worlds. Artist William Edmondson serves as an exemplar to ground our discussion of the Outsider field as we focus on resources, opportunity spaces, and legitimating discourses (Baumann, 2007) over time, to produce a multilevel and multifaceted approach to legitimation in aesthetic fields.

In this regard, technology transfer offices (TTOs) are becoming indispensable in their capacity as intermediaries between science, policy, industry, and the public. The purpose of this paper is to examine the strategies and operations of particularly productive transfer offices in five different countries in order to account for the high levels of transfer activity. Design/methodology/approach To this end, the authors interviewed 34 senior KTT managers in these offices. The collected protocols were analysed in three phases. First, the authors extracted and organised the key characteristics of the transfer practices by applying rigorous method of open-end, qualitative content analysis. The authors then enhanced the thus gathered descriptive statistics and ultimately developed a transfer office typology by building on the concept of attribute space. Findings The analysis suggests two ideal types of transfer offices, distinguishable in terms of their intertwined characteristics such as their goals, practices, sources of income, and positions within their associated organisations. While the primarily state-funded common good type would seek benefits to the public, the self-financed entrepreneurial type would pursue commercial success. The former would therefore create opportunities for disseminating knowledge and strengthening the local innovation ecosystem, while the latter would scout for promising ideas and cultivate relationships with industry. Originality/value The goal was to uncover the individual characteristics of the offices under study, and the relationships between these characteristics, that can help explain these offices’ exceptional productivity. This study is the first to propose a TTO typology, which can support interorganisational and international transfer collaboration. The findings provide empirical evidence for the theoretical Quadruple Helix model of the innovation system and have implications for research and practice.","2017","2025-07-26 06:53:46","2025-07-26 06:53:46","","70-95","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Technology transfer offices; I23; Knowledge and technology transfer; Academic spin-offs; O32; O31; International comparison; National specifics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through semi-structured questioning with 17 key informants, interviewees also described the contextual barriers and facilitators to incorporating new topic areas into existing curriculum. Interviews were recorded with consent, transcribed verbatim, and analysed by two researchers to identify key themes.ResultsInterviewees were enthusiastic about incorporating men’s health content through a men’s health curriculum framework but highlighted the need for systems to assist in identifying gaps in their current curriculum where the men’s health topics could be integrated. The student experience was identified as a key driver for men’s health teaching and learning. Furthermore, core men’s health clinical outcomes needed to be defined and topic areas vertically integrated across the curricula. This would ensure that students were appropriately equipped with the skills and knowledge for subsequent clinical practice in a range of geographical settings. Interviewees consistently suggested that the best implementation strategy is to have someone ‘on the ground’ to work directly with medical school staff and champion the men’s health discipline. Providing mechanisms for sharing knowledge and resources across medical schools was highlighted to facilitate implementation, particularly for those medical schools with limited men’s health teaching resources.ConclusionsDespite the unanimous support for men’s health teaching and learning, the evaluation highlighted that the student experience must be recognised as paramount when integrating new topic areas into an already packed curriculum. A community of practice, where medical schools share relevant resources and knowledge, could help to ensure a commonality of student experience with respect to men’s health learning in medical schools across different geographical settings and with different levels of resourcing. Such an approach could also be adapted to other areas of curriculum enhancement.","2015","2025-07-26 09:58:17","2025-07-26 09:58:17","","210","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In parts of Africa, as many as 50% of 15-year-olds and 77%-89% of adults have evidence of LTBI. A second key challenge to TB control is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated TB epidemic, and Africa alone accounts for one-quarter of the global burden of HIV-associated TB. HIV co-infection promotes both reactivation TB from LTBI and rapidly progressive primary TB following recent exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Preventing active TB and tackling latent infection in addition to the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course (DOTS) strategy could improve TB control in high-burden settings, especially where there is a high prevalence of HIV co-infection. Current strategies include intensified case finding (ICF), TB infection control, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). Although ART has been widely rolled out, ICF and IPT have not. A key factor limiting the rollout and effectiveness of IPT and ICF is the limitations of existing tools to both diagnose LTBI and identify those persons most at risk of progressing to active TB. In this review, we examine the obstacles and consider current progress toward the development of new tools to address this pressing global problem.","2011","2025-07-26 09:58:17","2025-07-26 09:58:17","","s1168-s1178","","suppl_4","204","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complexity increases when assessing the diverse funding streams of funders such as Asthma UK, a charitable patient organisation supporting medical research to benefit people with asthma. This paper aims to describe the various impacts identified from a range of Asthma UK research, and explore how Asthma UK utilised the characteristics of successful funding approaches to inform future research strategies.MethodsWe adapted the Payback Framework, using it both in a survey and to help structure interviews, documentary analysis, and case studies. We sent surveys to 153 lead researchers of projects, plus 10 past research fellows, and also conducted 14 detailed case studies. These covered nine projects and two fellowships, in addition to the innovative case studies on the professorial chairs (funded since 1988) and the MRC-Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma (the ‘Centre’) which together facilitated a comprehensive analysis of the whole funding portfolio. We organised each case study to capture whatever academic and wider societal impacts (or payback) might have arisen given the diverse timescales, size of funding involved, and extent to which Asthma UK funding contributed to the impacts.ResultsProjects recorded an average of four peer-reviewed journal articles. Together the chairs reported over 500 papers. All streams of funding attracted follow-on funding. Each of the various categories of societal impacts arose from only a minority of individual projects and fellowships. Some of the research portfolio is influencing asthma-related clinical guidelines, and some contributing to product development. The latter includes potentially major breakthroughs in asthma therapies (in immunotherapy, and new inhaled drugs) trialled by university spin-out companies. Such research-informed guidelines and medicines can, in turn, contribute to health improvements. The role of the chairs and the pioneering collaborative Centre is shown as being particularly important.ConclusionsWe systematically demonstrate that all types of Asthma UK’s research funding assessed are making impacts at different levels, but the main societal impacts from projects and fellowships come from a minority of those funded. Asthma UK used the study’s findings, especially in relation to the Centre, to inform research funding strategies to promote the achievement of impact.","2013","2025-07-26 09:58:17","2025-07-26 09:58:17","","17","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on recent insights in community ecology of the vaginal microbiome, we hypothesize that sustained vaginal DL-lactic acid enrichment will enhance the recruitment of lactobacilli, while counteracting bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria. We therefore aimed to develop an intravaginal device that would be easy to insert and remove, while providing sustained DL-lactic acid release into the vaginal lumen. The final prototype selected is a vaginal ring matrix system consisting of a mixture of ethylene vinyl acetate and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer loaded with 150 mg DL-lactic acid with an L/D-lactic acid ratio of 1:1. Preclinical safety assessment was performed by use of the Slug Mucosal Irritation test, a non-vertebrate assay to evaluate vaginal mucosal irritation, which revealed no irritation. Clinical safety was evaluated in a phase I trial with six healthy nulliparous premenopausal volunteering women, with the investigational drug left in place for 7 days. Colposcopic monitoring according to the WHO/CONRAD guidelines for the evaluation of vaginal products, revealed no visible cervicovaginal mucosal changes. No adverse events related to the investigational product occurred. Total release from the intravaginal ring over 7 days was estimated through high performance liquid chromatography at 37.1 (standard deviation 0.9) mg DL-lactic acid. Semisolid lactic acid formulations have been studied to a limited extent in the past and typically consist of a large volume of excipients and very high doses of lactic acid, which is of major concern to mucosal safety. We have documented the feasability of enriching the vaginal environment with pure DL-lactic acid with a prototype intravaginal ring. Though the efficacy of this platform remains to be established possibly requiring further development, this approach may offer a novel avenue to modulate and protect the vaginal microbiota.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:18","2025-07-26 09:58:18","","e0153441","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim is to describe miRNA levels related to early worsening renal function in acute HF patients. METHOD AND RESULTS: We studied the association between 12 circulating miRNAs and Worsening Renal Function (WRF; defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level of 0.3mg per deciliter or more from admission to day 3), absolute change in creatinine and Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) from admission to day 3 in 98 patients hospitalized for acute HF. At baseline, circulating levels of all miRNAs were lower in patients with WRF, with statistically significant decreased levels of miR-199a-3p, miR-423-3p, and miR-let-7i-5p (p-value<0.05). The increase in creatinine during the first 3 days of hospitalization was significantly associated with lower levels of miR-199a-3p, miR-27a-3p, miR-652-3p, miR-423-5p, and miR-let-7i-5p, while the increase in NGAL was significantly associated with lower levels of miR-18a-5p, miR-106a-5p, miR-223-3p, miR-199a-3p and miR-423-3p. MiR-199a-3p was the strongest predictor of WRF, with an Odds Ratio of 1.48 (1.061-2.065; p-value=0.021) and a C-index of 0.701. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the levels of circulating miRNAs at hospital admission for acute HF were consistently lower in patients who developed worsening of renal function.

For organisations traditionally buffered from the competitive pressures of for-profit enterprises, such as community-based organisations, this means developing the capacity to adapt to competitive tendering processes, shifting client expectations, and increasing demands for greater accountability. Drawing on ideas of institutional entrepreneurship, we believe that attempts to build adaptive capacity require the transformation of existing institutional arrangements. Key in this may be identifying and fostering institutional entrepreneurs–actors who take the lead in being the impetus for, and giving direction to, structural change. This study focuses on the strategies used by institutional entrepreneurs to build adaptive capacity in the community-based healthcare sector. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The research will use an adapted rapid realist review. The review will find underlying theories that explain the circumstances surrounding the implementation of capacity-building strategies that shape organisational response and generate outcomes by activating causal mechanisms. An early scoping of the literature, and consultations with key stakeholders, will be undertaken to identify an initial programme theory. We will search for relevant journal articles and grey literature. Data will be extracted based on contextual factors, mechanisms and outcomes, and their configurations. The analysis will seek patterns and regularities in these configurations and will focus on confirming, refuting or refining our programme theory. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study does not involve primary research and, therefore, does not require formal ethical approval.

It is unique among the ultra-orphan disorders in that four treatments are currently approved by various regulatory authorities for use in routine clinical practice. Hitherto, because of the relatively few people affected worldwide, many of whom started therapy during a prolonged period when there were essentially no alternatives to imiglucerase, these treatments have not been systematically evaluated in studies such as randomized controlled trials now considered necessary to generate the highest level of clinical evidence. OBJECTIVES: To summarize all available randomized controlled study data on the efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapies and substrate reduction therapy for treating Gaucher disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov for any ongoing studies with potential interim results, and through PubMed. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of last search: 07 August 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies (including open-label studies and cross-over studies) assessing enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, or both, in all types of Gaucher disease were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted relevant data. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 488 studies retrieved by the electronic searches, eight met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (300 participants). Response parameters were restricted to haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen and liver volume and serum biomarkers (chitotriosidase and CCL18). Only one publication reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies included were randomized.Four studies reported the responses to enzyme replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two years. One study compared substrate reduction therapy, enzyme replacement therapy and a combination thereof as maintenance therapy in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy. One study examined substrate reduction therapy in people with chronic neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease who continued to receive enzyme replacement therapy.Treatment-naïve participants had similar increases in haemoglobin when comparing those receiving imiglucerase or alglucerase at 60 units/kg, imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa at 60 U/kg, taliglucerase alfa at 30 units/kg or 60 units/kg, and velaglucerase alfa at 45 units/g or 60 units/kg. For platelet count response in participants with intact spleens, a benefit for imiglucerase over velaglucerase alfa at 60 units/kg was observed, mean difference -79.87 (95% confidence interval -137.57 to -22.17). There were no other significant differences in platelet count response when comparing different doses of velaglucerase alfa and of taliglucerase alfa, and when comparing imiglucerase to alglucerase. Spleen and liver volume reductions were not significantly different in any enzyme replacement therapy product or dose comparison study. Although a dose effect on serum biomarkers was not seen after nine months, a significantly greater reduction with higher dose was reported after 12 months in the velaglucerase study, mean difference 16.70 (95% confidence intervaI 1.51 to 31.89). In the two enzyme replacement therapy maintenance studies comparing infusions every two weeks and every four weeks, there were no significant differences in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and spleen and liver volumes over a 6 to 12 month period when participants were treated with the same cumulative dose.A total of 25 serious adverse events were reported, nearly all deemed unrelated to treatment.There are, as yet, no randomized trials of substrate reduction therapy in treatment-naïve patients that can be evaluated. Miglustat monotherapy appeared as effective as continued enzyme replacement therapy for maintenance of hematological, organ and biomarker responses in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase for at least two years. In those with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, no significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count or organ volumes occurred when enzyme replacement therapy was augmented with miglustat.One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results reflect the limitations of analysing evidence restricted to prospective randomized controlled trials, especially when dealing with chronic rare diseases. This analysis suggests that, during the first year of treatment, different recombinant glucocerebrosidases are bio-similar and non-inferior in safety and efficacy for surrogate biological response parameters. Enzyme replacement therapy given at 30 to 45 units/kg body weight every two to four weeks was generally as effective as the 60 unit/kg dose for the assessed clinical outcomes. The analysis emphasise the need to determine whether it is realistic to carry out multi-decade prospective clinical trials for rare diseases such as type 1 Gaucher disease. With large treatment effects on the classical manifestations of the disorder, therapeutic investigations in Gaucher disease mandate innovative trial designs and methodology to secure decisive data concerning long-term efficacy and safety - with the realization that knowledge about disease-modifying actions that are sustained are of crucial importance to people with this chronic condition.","2015","2025-07-26 09:58:18","2025-07-26 09:58:18","","cd010324","","3","2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These abilities are essential for health and survival and are expected to have a prominent genetic basis. We modeled these abilities in eight common mouse inbred strains covering ∼75% of the species' natural variation and in gene-trap mice (>2000 mice), using an unsupervised, automated assay with an instrumented home cage (PhenoTyper) containing a shelter with two entrances. Mice visited this shelter for 20-1200 times/24 h and 71% of all mice developed a significant and often strong preference for one entrance. Subsequently, a mild aversive stimulus (shelter illumination) was automatically delivered when mice used their preferred entrance. Different genotypes developed different coping strategies. Firstly, the number of entries via the preferred entrance decreased in DBA/2J, C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ, indicating that these genotypes associated one specific entrance with the aversive stimulus. Secondly, mice started sleeping outside (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J), indicating they associated the shelter, in general, with the aversive stimulus. Some mice showed no evidence for an association between the entrance and the aversive light, but did show markedly shorter shelter residence times in response to illumination, indicating they did perceive illumination as aversive. Finally, using this assay, we screened 43 different mutants, which yielded a novel gene, specc1/cytospinB. This mutant showed profound and specific delay in avoidance learning. Together, these data suggest that different genotypes express distinct learning and/or memory of associations between shelter entrance and aversive stimuli, and that specc1/cytospinB is involved in this aspect of cognition.","2012","2025-07-26 09:58:18","2025-07-26 09:58:18","","772-784","","7","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A disadvantage of this treatment is that healing is accompanied by scar formation. Application of autologous epidermal cells (keratinocytes and melanocytes) may be a suitable therapeutic alternative, since this may enhance wound closure and improve scar quality. A prospective, multicenter randomized clinical trial was performed in 40 adult patients with acute full thickness burns. On two comparable wound areas, conventional treatment with SSGs was compared to an experimental treatment consisting of SSGs in combination with cultured autologous epidermal cells (ECs) seeded in a collagen carrier. The primary outcome measure was wound closure after 5-7 days. Secondary outcomes were safety aspects and scar quality measured by graft take, scar score (POSAS), skin colorimeter (DermaSpectrometer) and elasticity (Cutometer). Wound epithelialization after 5-7 days was significantly better for the experimental treatment (71%) compared to the standard treatment (67%) (p = 0.034, Wilcoxon), whereas the take rates of the grafts were similar. No related adverse events were recorded. Scar quality was evaluated at 3 (n = 33) and 12 (n = 28) months. The POSAS of the observer after 3 and 12 months and of the patient after 12 months were significantly better for the experimental area. Improvements between 12% and 23% (p ≤ 0.010, Wilcoxon) were detected for redness, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability. Melanin index at 3 and 12 months and erythema index at 12 months were closer to normal skin for the experimental treatment than for conventional treatment (p ≤ 0.025 paired samples t-test). Skin elasticity showed significantly higher elasticity (p = 0.030) in the experimental area at 3 months follow-up. We showed a safe application and significant improvements of wound healing and scar quality in burn patients after treatment with ECs versus SSGs only. The relevance of cultured autologous cells in treatment of extensive burns is supported by our current findings.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:18","2025-07-26 09:58:18","","437-448","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are two cell lines that are currently in an advanced state of BAL development; HepaRG and HepG2/C3A. In this study we aimed to compare both cell lines on applicability in BALs and to identify possible strategies for further improvement. We tested both cell lines in monolayer- and BAL cultures on growth characteristics, hepatic differentiation, nitrogen-, carbohydrate-, amino acid- and xenobiotic metabolism. Interestingly, both cell lines adapted the hepatocyte phenotype more closely when cultured in BALs; e.g. monolayer cultures produced lactate, while BAL cultures showed diminished lactate production (C3A) or conversion to elimination (HepaRG), and urea cycle activity increased upon BAL culturing in both cell lines. HepaRG-BALs outperformed C3A-BALs on xenobiotic metabolism, ammonia elimination and lactate elimination, while protein synthesis was comparable. In BAL cultures of both cell lines ammonia elimination correlated positively with glutamine production and glutamate consumption, suggesting ammonia elimination was mainly driven by the balance between glutaminase and glutamine synthetase activity. Both cell lines lacked significant urea cycle activity and both required multiple culture weeks before reaching optimal differentiation in BALs. In conclusion, culturing in BALs enhanced hepatic functionality of both cell lines and from these, the HepaRG cells are the most promising proliferative cell source for BAL application.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:19","2025-07-26 09:58:19","","964-978","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Presently, surveillance is based on traditional protocols and classical microbiology. Innovation in monitoring is required not only to enhance safety or speed up controls but also to prevent cross infections due to novel or uncultivable pathogens. In order to improve surveillance monitoring, we propose that biological fluid microflora (mf) on reprocessed devices is a potential indicator of sanitation failure, when tested by an mfDNA-based approach. The survey focused on oral microflora traces in dental care settings.MethodsExperimental tests (n = 48) and an “in field” trial (n = 83) were performed on dental instruments. Conventional microbiology and amplification of bacterial genes by multiple real-time PCR were applied to detect traces of salivary microflora. Six different sanitation protocols were considered. A monitoring protocol was developed and performance of the mfDNA assay was evaluated by sensitivity and specificity.ResultsContaminated samples resulted positive for saliva traces by the proposed approach (CT < 35). In accordance with guidelines, only fully sanitized samples were considered negative (100 %). Culture-based tests confirmed disinfectant efficacy, but failed in detecting incomplete sanitation. The method provided sensitivity and specificity over 95 %.ConclusionsThe principle of detecting biological fluids by mfDNA analysis seems promising for monitoring the effectiveness of instrument reprocessing. The molecular approach is simple, fast and can provide a valid support for surveillance in dental care or other hospital settings.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:19","2025-07-26 09:58:19","","394","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while RRI encourages innovation through societal engagement, it can give rise to complex and previously untested issues that challenge the existing legal frameworks on intellectual property (IP) and public entitlement to benefits of research. In the case of biobanking, the personal nature of human biological materials and often altruistic intention of participants to donate samples intensifies the need to adhere to RRI principles with respect to the research, development, and commercialization of innovations derived from biobanks. However, stakeholders participate and collaborate with others in the innovation process to fulfill their own agenda. Without IP to safeguard investments in R&D, stakeholders may hesitate to contribute to the translation of discoveries into innovations. To realize the public benefit objective, RRI principles must protect the interests of stakeholders involved in the translation and commercialization of knowledge. This article explores the seemingly contradictory and competing objectives of open science and commercialization and proposes a holistic innovation framework directed at improving RRI practice for positive impact on obtaining the optimal social and economic values from research.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:19","2025-07-26 09:58:19","","611-635","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, there is a range of competencies that is used by many companies. Researchers have developed core competency terminology to underline their cross-organizational value. The article presents a theoretical model of core competencies consisting of two main higher-order competencies called performance and entrepreneurship. Each of them consists of three elements: the performance competency includes cooperation, organization of work and goal orientation, while entrepreneurship includes innovativeness, calculated risk-taking and pro-activeness. However, there is lack of empirical validation of competency concepts in organizations and this would seem crucial for obtaining reliable results from organizational research. We propose a two-step empirical validation procedure: (1) confirmation factor analysis, and (2) classification of employees. The sample consisted of 636 respondents (M = 44.5; SD = 15.1). Participants were administered a questionnaire developed for the study purpose. The reliability, measured by Cronbach's alpha, ranged from 0.60 to 0.83 for six scales. Next, we tested the model using a confirmatory factor analysis. The two separate, single models of performance and entrepreneurial orientations fit quite well to the data, while a complex model based on the two single concepts needs further research. In the classification of employees based on the two higher order competencies we obtained four main groups of employees. Their profiles relate to those found in the literature, including so-called niche finders and top performers.

DESIGN: Women between 50 and 60 years, with a BMI ≥27 kg/m(2), free of knee OA, were recruited. Using binary logistic regression, the association between baseline concentration of serum fibulin (Fib)3-1, Fib3-2 and Fib3-3 and incidence of clinical and radiographic knee OA after 30 months of follow-up was evaluated. RESULTS: Baseline and follow-up measurements were available for 241 women with a mean age of 55.9 ± 3.2 years and mean BMI of 31.7 ± 3.6 kg/m(2). None of the concentrations of the three Fib3 epitopes were associated with the incidence of medial or lateral joint space narrowing (JSN) ≥1.0 mm or the incidence of Kellgren & Lawrence (K&L) grade ≥2 after 30 months. All three Fib3 epitopes were associated with the incidence of the clinical and radiographic ACR-criteria and Fib3-1 and Fib3-3 also with chronic pain at follow-up. When adjusted for the other Fib3 peptide concentrations, only Fib3-1 was significantly associated to the incidence of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-criteria (OR 3.2 [1.2-8.7]) and chronic pain at follow-up (OR 3.0 [1.2-7.7]). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline fibulin-3 concentrations are associated with the incidence of clinical knee OA among middle-aged overweight and obese women. Therewith, they meet the criteria of a prognostic biomarker according to the BIPED biomarker classification for OA. Further validation of the fibulin-3 epitopes seems warranted in order to better distinguish subgroups of individuals at increased risk for knee OA development.","2015","2025-07-26 09:58:19","2025-07-26 09:58:19","","672-678","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND: One of the innovative approaches to dealing with the anticipated shortage of physicians is to reallocate tasks from the professional domain of medicine to the nursing domain. Various (cost-)effectiveness studies demonstrate that nurse practitioners can deliver as high quality care as physicians and can achieve as good outcomes. However, these studies do not examine what factors may facilitate or hinder such task reallocation. METHOD: A systematic literature review of PubMed and Web of Knowledge supplemented with a snowball research method. The principles of thematic analysis were followed. RESULTS: The 13 identified relevant papers address a broad spectrum of task reallocation (delegation, substitution and complementary care). Thematic analysis revealed four categories of facilitators and barriers: (1) knowledge and capabilities, (2) professional boundaries, (3) organisational environment, and (4) institutional environment. CONCLUSION: Introducing nurse practitioners in healthcare requires organisational redesign and the reframing of professional boundaries. Especially the facilitators and barriers in the analytical themes of 'professional boundaries' and 'organisational environment' should be considered when reallocating tasks. If not, these factors might hamper the cost-effectiveness of task reallocation in practice.","2014","2025-07-26 09:58:20","2025-07-26 09:58:20","","151-169","","2","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, retaining citizen trust and support for research encourages caution in pursuit of commercial science. OBJECTIVES: We explore citizen expectations of the specifically academic nature of commercial science [i.e. academic entrepreneurship (AE)] and the influence of conflict of interest concerns, hopes about practical benefits and general beliefs. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional national opinion survey of 1002 Canadians online in 2010. RESULTS: Approval of AE was moderate (mean 3.2/5, SD 0.84), but varied by entrepreneurial activity. Concern about conflict of interests (COI) was moderate (mean 2.9/5, SD 0.86) and varied by type of concern. An ordinary least-squares regression showed that expectations of practical benefits informed support for AE, specifically that academic-industry collaboration can better address real-world problems; conflict of interest concerns were insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that citizens support AE for its potential to produce practical benefits, but enthusiasm varies and is reduced for activities that may prioritize private over public interests. Further, support exists despite concern about COI, perhaps due to trust in the academic research context. For user engagement in research priority setting, these findings suggest the need to attend to the commercial nature of translational science. For research policy, they suggest the need for governance arrangements for responsible innovation, which can sustain public trust in academic research, and realize the practical benefits that inform public support for AE.","2014","2025-07-26 09:58:20","2025-07-26 09:58:20","","2356-2374","","6","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits free serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). It is called an 'anti-IgE' drug. IgE is an immune mediator involved in clinical manifestations of asthma. A recent update of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in 2013 recommends omalizumab for use as add-on therapy in adults and children over six years of age with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE-mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of omalizumab versus placebo or conventional therapy for asthma in adults and children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials for potentially relevant studies. The most recent search was performed in June 2013. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and searched online trial registries and drug company websites. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials examining anti-IgE administered in any manner for any duration. Trials with co-interventions were included, as long as they were the same in each arm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted and entered data. Three modes of administration were identified from the published literature: inhaled, intravenous and subcutaneous injection. The main focus of the updated review is subcutaneous administration, as this route is currently used in clinical practice. Subgroup analysis was performed by asthma severity. Data were extracted from published and unpublished sources. MAIN RESULTS: In all, 25 trials were included in the review, including 11 new studies since the last update, for a total of 19 that considered the efficacy of subcutaneous anti-IgE treatment as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids.For participants with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving background inhaled corticosteroid steroid (ICS) therapy, a significant advantage favoured subcutaneous omalizumab with regard to experiencing an asthma exacerbation (odds ratio (OR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.60; ten studies, 3261 participants). This represents an absolute reduction from 26% for participants suffering an exacerbation on placebo to 16% on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 weeks. A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous omalizumab versus placebo with regard to reducing hospitalisations (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; four studies, 1824 participants), representing an absolute reduction in risk from 3% with placebo to 0.5% with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks. No separate data on hospitalisations were available for the severe asthma subgroup, and all of these data were reported for participants with the diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma. Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab were also significantly more likely to be able to withdraw their ICS completely than those treated with placebo (OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.00 to 3.13), and a small but statistically significant reduction in daily inhaled steroid dose was reported for omalizumab-treated participants compared with those given placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) -118 mcg beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalent per day, 95% CI -154 to -84). However, no significant difference between omalizumab and placebo treatment groups was seen in the number of participants who were able to withdraw from oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.63).Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids required a small but significant reduction in rescue beta2-agonist medication compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) -0.39 puffs per day, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.24; nine studies, 3524 participants). This benefit was observed in both the moderate to severe (MD -0.58, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.31) and severe (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.10) asthma subgroups on a background therapy of inhaled corticosteroids; however, no significant difference between subcutaneous omalizumab and placebo was noted for this outcome in participants with severe asthma who were receiving a background therapy of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer serious adverse events were reported in participants assigned to subcutaneous omalizumab than in those receiving placebo (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 15 studies, 5713 participants), but more injection site reactions were observed (from 5.6% with placebo to 9.1% with omalizumab).To reflect current clinical practice, discussion of the results is limited to subcutaneous use, and trials involving intravenous and inhaled routes have been archived. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Omalizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and hospitalisations as an adjunctive therapy to inhaled steroids and during steroid tapering phases of clinical trials. Omalizumab was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their inhaled steroids. Omalizumab was generally well tolerated, although more injection site reactions were seen with omalizumab. Further assessment in paediatric populations is necessary, as is direct double-dummy comparison with ICS. Although subgroup analyses suggest that participants receiving prednisolone had better asthma control when they received omalizumab, it remains to be tested prospectively whether the addition of omalizumab has a prednisolone-sparing effect. It is also not clear whether there is a threshold level of baseline serum IgE for optimum efficacy of omalizumab. Given the high cost of the drug, identification of biomarkers predictive of response is of major importance for future research.","2014","2025-07-26 09:58:20","2025-07-26 09:58:20","","cd003559","","1","2014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to characterize the dose-dependency of mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) using FeNO and sputum eosinophil percentage as surrogates of airway inflammation in subjects with allergic asthma. METHODS: Following a 2-week, open-label run-in, 93 subjects (≥12 y) using only short-acting beta agonist reliever medication as needed, were randomized to twice daily (BID) placebo; MF/F 100/10 μg, 200/10 μg, or 400/10 μg (via pressurized metered-dose inhaler [MDI]); MF-MDI 200 μg; or MF 200 μg via dry powder inhaler (DPI) during a 2-week, double-blind treatment period. RESULTS: All active treatments demonstrated significant percentage reductions from baseline in FeNO compared with placebo at all time points (P ≤ 0.034). At endpoint, mean MF/F treatment group FeNO reductions ranged from -35.3% to -61.4%. Sputum eosinophil percentage reductions from baseline were significant compared with placebo for the MF/F 200/10 μg, MF/F 400/10 μg, and MF-DPI 200 μg groups at endpoint (P ≤ 0.023). Escalating MF/F doses significantly reduced both FeNO (P ≤ 0.001) and sputum eosinophil (P ≤ 0.022) levels in a dose-dependent manner at all time points. All treatments were well tolerated; no serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: All 3 MF/F doses demonstrated pronounced, clinically meaningful, dose-dependent reductions in FeNO, with reduced sputum eosinophil levels for MF/F 200/10 μg and MF/F 400/10 μg. These findings suggest both inflammatory markers may be useful in assessing corticosteroid responsiveness in asthma patients, and perhaps identifying the same asthma subphenotype.

Five qualitative case studies were undertaken across the three countries, consisting of 119 semi-structured interviews with a range of healthcare workers. The informants were purposively selected and their perspectives of evidence-based practice (EBP) within stroke care were explored. The data were analysed through thematic content analysis. The two key themes that emerged from the data were the health professionals' degrees of EBP and specialisation. The results illustrate how the two concepts of clinical specialisation and evidence are interrelated and work together to influence the different professions' degree of professional jurisdiction. It is concluded that doctors' professional dominance gives them full jurisdiction in stroke care and that nurses' and therapists' degrees of jurisdiction is dependent on their ability to specialise.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:20","2025-07-26 09:58:20","","15-23","","","155","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we will take a critical view from a methodological perspective. We focus our attention on the various types of metrics available, whether or not data redundancies are addressed, and if metrics should be assembled into a single composite overall score or not. We address these issues in some detail by emphasizing one metric in particular: university–industry co-authored publications (UICs). We compare the RIU with three variants of our own University–Industry R&D Linkage Index, which we derived from the bibliometric analysis of 750 research universities worldwide. Our findings highlight conceptual and methodological problems with UIC-based data, as well as computational weaknesses such university ranking systems. Avoiding choices between size-dependent or independent metrics, and between single-metrics and multi-metrics systems, we recommend an alternative ‘scoreboard’ approach: (1) without weighing systems of metrics and composite scores; (2) computational procedures and information sources are made more transparent; (3) size-dependent metrics are kept separate from size-independent metrics; (4) UIC metrics are selected according to the type of proximity relationship between universities and industry.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:21","2025-07-26 09:58:21","","677-696","","2","109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using FreeO2 in patients hospitalized in the respiratory ward for an acute exacerbation of COPD. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing FreeO2 vs manual oxygen titration in the respiratory ward of a university hospital. We measured the perception of appropriateness of oxygen titration and monitoring in both groups by nurses and attending physicians using a Likert scale. We evaluated the time in the target range of oxygen saturation (SpO2) as defined for each patient by the attending physician, the time with severe desaturation (SpO2 <85%), and the time with hyperoxia (SpO2 >5% above the target). We also recorded length of stay, intensive care unit admissions, and readmission rate. Fifty patients were randomized (25 patients in both groups; mean age: 72±8 years; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 1.00±0.49 L; and mean initial O2 flow 2.0±1.0 L/min). RESULTS: Nurses and attending physicians felt that oxygen titration and monitoring were equally appropriate with both O2 administration systems. The percentage of time within the SpO2 target was significantly higher with FreeO2, and the time with severe desaturation and hyperoxia was significantly reduced with FreeO2. Time from study inclusion to hospital discharge was 5.8±4.4 days with FreeO2 and 8.4±6.0 days with usual oxygen administration (P=0.051). CONCLUSION: FreeO2 was deemed as an appropriate oxygen administration system by nurses and physicians of a respiratory unit. This system maintained SpO2 at the target level better than did manual titration and reduced periods of desaturation and hyperoxia. Our results also suggest that FreeO2 has the potential to reduce the hospital length of stay.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:21","2025-07-26 09:58:21","","1983-1990","","0","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accumulating evidence indicates that the postnatal mammalian heart retains a pool of tissue-specific progenitor cells and is also repopulated by cells from extracardiac sources.

Without institutions that facilitate appropriate health care transactions, patients tend to navigate health care markets from one inappropriate provider to another, receiving sub-optimal care, before they find appropriate providers; all the while incurring personal transaction costs. But the top-down interventions to address this barrier to accessing care are hampered by weak governments, as informal providers are entrenched in communities. To explore the role that communities could play in limiting informal providers, we applied the transaction costs theory of the firm which predicts that economic agents tend to organise production within firms when the costs of coordinating exchange through the market are greater than within a firm. In a realist analysis of qualitative data from Nigeria, we found that community health committees sometimes seek to limit informal providers in a manner that is consistent with the transaction costs theory of the firm. The committees deal not through legal sanction but by subtle influence and persuasion in a slow and faltering process of institutional change, leveraging the authority and resources available within their community, and from governments and NGOs. First, they provide information to reduce the market share controlled by informal providers, and then regulation to keep informal providers at bay while making the formal provider more competitive. When these efforts are ineffective or insufficient, committees are faced with a “make-or-buy” decision. The “make” decision involves coordination to co-produce formal health services and facilitate referrals from informal to formal providers. What sometimes results is a quasi-firm—informal and formal providers are networked in a single but loose production unit. These findings suggest that efforts to limit informal providers should seek to, among other things, augment existing community responses.","2016","2025-07-26 09:58:22","2025-07-26 09:58:22","","51","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The urgency to unravel the causes of skin ageing is rising. However, there is a lack of objective, simple, noninvasive methods to assess biological skin age - a term introduced to describe how old someone looks, covering both the appearance and function of the skin. A rapid, noninvasive assessment of biological skin age would greatly facilitate the execution of the studies required to find the causes of skin ageing. OBJECTIVES: To find an objective, easy-to-apply method to assess biological skin age. METHODS: Skin age score (SAS) was compared with skin autofluorescence, a measure of advanced glycation end products in the skin, and several subject characteristics in 32 healthy, white women with little sun-exposed skin and no history of smoking. RESULTS: A moderate, positive correlation (R(2) = 0·32, P = 0·001) between SAS and skin autofluorescence-based biological skin age was found. However, the variation in biological skin age according to SAS could be explained better by body mass index, chronological age and hormonal status (R(2) = 0·86, P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: In the current setting skin autofluorescence did not contribute better to the prediction of biological skin age than chronological age. Biological skin age was best predicted by body mass index, chronological age and hormonal status, and this approach provides a considerable simplification of the application of biological skin age.","2015","2025-07-26 09:58:22","2025-07-26 09:58:22","","1199-1204","","5","173","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, rare studies have until now investigated the value of biomarkers in these patients. Thus, we determined Coll2-1, a marker of type II collagen denaturation, its nitrated form (Coll2-1NO2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in serum of patients with EHOA vs non-EHOA and subsequently evaluated their relationships with disease indices of severity and activity. METHODS: Coll2-1, Coll2-1NO2 and MPO were measured using specific immunoassays in 82 patients, 57 with EHOA, all females, median age 59 (41-74 yrs) and 20 with non-EHOA, all females, median age 55 (43-73 yrs), fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for hand OA. EHOA was characterized by the presence of at least one central bone erosion on radiograph in the IP joints. Patients were also evaluated for disease duration, number of affected (swollen and painful or tender) joints, radiographic score (RS) by Kallman scale and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). RESULTS: Serum levels of MPO were higher in EHOA (230.0 ± 152.1 ng/ml) than in non-EHOA (160.2 ± 111.5 ng/ml, P=0.037). Coll2-1NO2 levels trended towards an elevation in EHOA compared non-EHOA (0.40 ± 0.86 vs 0.22 ± 0.14 nmol/l, P=0.06), while Coll2-1 levels were not different. Correlations were found for disease duration and both MPO (R(2)=0.48, P=0.001) and Coll2-1NO2 (R(2)=0.73, P=0.01) after the splitting of the population in subgroups according to a cut off value above the 50th percentile. A correlation was found between hsCRP and MPO (R(2)=0.57, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly demonstrates an elevation of some serum biomarkers in EHOA, in comparison with non-EHOA. In particular, MPO, hsCRP and the ratio Coll2-1NO2/Coll2-1 discriminated the two subsets of hand osteoarthritis (HOA), and a trend was also observed for Coll2-1NO2.

METHODS: Five subjects were investigated using invasive intracortical pins to track the movement of the tibia, talus, and calcaneus during walking with and without a foot orthosis. RESULTS: The antipronation foot orthosis produced small and unsystematic reductions in eversion and abduction of the heel relative to the leg at various times during stance. Changes in calcaneus-tibia motion were comparable with those described in the literature (1°-3°). Changes at both the ankle and subtalar joints contributed to this orthotic effect. However, the nature and scale of changes were highly variable between subjects. Peak angular position, range of motion, and angular velocity in frontal and transverse planes were affected to different degrees in different subjects. In some cases, changes occurred mainly at the ankle; in other cases, changes occurred mainly at the subtalar joint. CONCLUSION: The changes in ankle and subtalar kinematics in response to the foot orthosis contradict existing orthotic paradigms that assume that changes occur only at the subtalar joint. The kinematic changes due to the orthosis are indicative of a strong interaction between the often common function of the ankle and subtalar joints.","2012","2025-07-26 09:58:23","2025-07-26 09:58:23","","2384-2391","","12","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These VC panels educate academics on 2 important and interconnected issues: how to ""pitch"" their ideas in the business world and what to consider when creating a company. In these sessions, academia-based start-up companies present their ideas before a VC panel composed of professional investors and receive feedback on their idea, business plan, and presentation techniques. Recent panel recommendations from Medicine 2.0 conferences fell into 7 categories: (1) the product, service, or idea you are developing into a company, (2) determine market forces and identify the target audience, (3) describe your competitive advantage, (4) the business plan, (5) current and future resources and capabilities, (6) legal aspects, and (7) general advice on the art of pitching. The academic and business literature validates many of these recommendations suggesting that VC panels may be a viable and cost-effective introduction to business and entrepreneurial education for physicians and other health care professionals. Panels benefit not only the presenting companies, but also the physicians, psychologists, and other health care professionals attending the session. Incorporating VC panels into academic conferences might also illuminate the need for incorporating relevant business training within academia.","2014","2025-07-26 09:58:23","2025-07-26 09:58:23","","e184","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of pharmaceutical companies for this specific analysis arises from less variability of standards than healthcare facilities. In this qualitative and quantitative analysis, we focused on three useful areas of implementation, including R&D productivity, commercialization strategies, and expenditures determinants of pharmaceutical companies. Studies and reports of online databases from 1965 to 2014 were reviewed according to specific search terms. Initially, 218 articles and reports were found and examined, but only 91 were considered appropriate and used for further analysis. We identified some suggested implementation strategies relevant for marketing to enhance companies' own R&D strategies; such as reliability of companies on ""sourcing-in"" R&D facilities and ""think-tank"" events. Regardless of the study and of the country, cash flow and profitability always positively influenced R&D expenditure, while sales and firm size did not. We consider that handling R&D determinants should require caution. It seems critical that implementation of R&D systems is directly related with productivity, if it reflects dual embodiment of efficiency and effectiveness. Scrutinizing the determinants of R&D expenditures emphasizes significant factors that are worth to highlight when planning an R&D investment strategy. Although there is no receipt fitting every situation, we think that health care plan makers may find relevant data in this systematic review in creating an initial implementation framework.","2015","2025-07-26 09:58:24","2025-07-26 09:58:24","","70-82","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, healthcare staff often find it difficult to act on this feedback in order to make improvements to services. This paper draws upon notions of legitimacy and readiness to develop a conceptual framework (Patient Feedback Response Framework - PFRF) which outlines why staff may find it problematic to respond to patient feedback. A large qualitative study was conducted with 17 ward based teams between 2013 and 2014, across three hospital Trusts in the North of England. This was a process evaluation of a wider study where ward staff were encouraged to make action plans based on patient feedback. We focus on three methods here: i) examination of taped discussion between ward staff during action planning meetings ii) facilitators notes of these meetings iii) telephone interviews with staff focusing on whether action plans had been achieved six months later. Analysis employed an abductive approach. Through the development of the PFRF, we found that making changes based on patient feedback is a complex multi-tiered process and not something that ward staff can simply 'do'. First, staff must exhibit normative legitimacy - the belief that listening to patients is a worthwhile exercise. Second, structural legitimacy has to be in place - ward teams need adequate autonomy, ownership and resource to enact change. Some ward teams are able to make improvements within their immediate control and environment. Third, for those staff who require interdepartmental co-operation or high level assistance to achieve change, organisational readiness must exist at the level of the hospital otherwise improvement will rarely be enacted. Case studies drawn from our empirical data demonstrate the above. It is only when appropriate levels of individual and organisational capacity to change exist, that patient feedback is likely to be acted upon to improve services.","2017","2025-07-26 09:58:24","2025-07-26 09:58:24","","19-27","","","178","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AHCODA-DB allows monitoring in vivo effects of compounds collected from conventional behavioural tests and from automated home-cage experiments assessing spontaneous behaviour, anxiety and cognition without human interference. AHCODA-DB includes such data from mutant mice (transgenics, knock-out, knock-in), (recombinant) inbred strains, and compound effects in wildtype mice and disease models. AHCODA-DB provides real time statistical analyses with single mouse resolution and versatile suite of data presentation tools. On March 9th, 2017 AHCODA-DB contained 650 k data points on 2419 parameters from 1563 mice.ConclusionAHCODA-DB provides users with tools to systematically explore mouse behavioural data, both with positive and negative outcome, published and unpublished, across time and experiments with single mouse resolution. The standardized (automated) experimental settings and the large current dataset (1563 mice) in AHCODA-DB provide a unique framework for the interpretation of behavioural data and drug effects. The use of common ontologies allows data export to other databases such as the Mouse Phenome Database. Unbiased presentation of positive and negative data obtained under the highly standardized screening conditions increase cost efficiency of publicly funded mouse screening projects and help to reach consensus conclusions on drug responses and mouse behavioural phenotypes.

We present in vitro mode of action methods to (i) determine viability: epithelial expansion, proliferation (Ki-67), metabolic activity (MTT assay); (ii) characterize skin and gingiva substitutes: histology and immunohistochemistry; and (iii) determine potency: soluble wound healing mediator release (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Both skin and gingiva substitutes consist of metabolically active autologous reconstructed differentiated epithelium expanding from the original biopsy sheet on a fibroblast populated connective tissue matrix (donor dermis). Gingival epithelium expanded 1.7-fold more than skin epithelium during the 3 week culture period. The percentage of proliferating Ki-67-positive cells located in the basal layer of the gingiva substitute was >1.5-fold higher than in the skin substitute. Keratins 16 and 17, which are upregulated during normal wound healing, were expressed in both the skin and gingiva substitutes. Notably, the gingiva substitute secreted higher amounts of key cytokines involved in mitogenesis, motogenesis and chemotaxis (interleukin-6 > 23-fold, CXCL8 > 2.5-fold) as well as higher amounts of the anti-fibrotic growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor (>7-fold), compared with the skin substitute. In conclusion, while addressing the viability, characterization and potency of the tissue substitutes, important intrinsic differences between skin and gingiva were discovered that may explain in part the superior quality of wound healing observed in the oral mucosa compared with skin.","2017","2025-07-26 09:58:24","2025-07-26 09:58:24","","e1088-e1097","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: To facilitate CTC enumeration, we established a CK/EPCAM-combined immunostaining strategy and an automated CTC analytical pipeline using an open-source image analyzer. By virtue of this workflow, we conducted a pilot study of 56 cancer patients and 21 healthy individuals using a high-throughput spiral microfluidic chip system. To facilitate genetic discovery of somatic mutations in CTCs, we integrated the CTC enumeration into next-generation sequencing and established a straightforward amplicon library comprising diversifier random sequences to sequence CTC samples. RESULTS: The CTC staining and enumeration workflow achieved 80.4% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity (AUC = 0.87, p = 0.004, power = 0.985), as evaluated by ROC analysis. Univariate and multivariate analysis verified that the CTC (CK/EpCAM+CD45-), but not other cell populations, is a significant and independent biomarker for cancer patients (p < 0.01). Serial CTC monitoring of the patients revealed reduction in CTC numbers after treatments, suggesting its clinical utility in pharmacodynamic studies. Deep sequencing of CTC samples revealed somatic mutations in TP53 and ESR1. CONCLUSIONS: The significance of this report is to demonstrate a systematic and adaptable workflow to bridge the gap between the microfluidic enrichment and CTC analyses, which fosters broader applications of CTCs in both clinical settings and academic studies.","2017","2025-07-26 09:58:25","2025-07-26 09:58:25","","e0177276","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined the contentious debate on whether to limit experiments involving the creation of potentially pandemic pathogens. Hundreds of scientists, including Nobel laureates, have signed petitions on the debate, providing unique insights into how scientists take a public stand on important scientific policies. Using 19,257 papers published by participants, we reconstructed their collaboration networks and research specializations. Although we found significant peer associations overall, those opposing ""gain-of-function"" research are more sensitive to peers than are proponents. Conversely, specializing in fields directly related to gain-of-function research (immunology, virology) predicts public support better than specializing in fields related to potential pathogenic risks (such as public health) predicts opposition. These findings suggest that different social processes might drive support compared with opposition. Supporters are embedded in a tight-knit scholarly community that is likely both more familiar with and trusting of the relevant risk mitigation practices. Opponents, on the other hand, are embedded in a looser federation of widely varying academic specializations with cognate knowledge of disease and epidemics that seems to draw more heavily on peers. Understanding how scientists' social embeddedness shapes the policy actions they take is important for helping sides interpret each other's position accurately, avoiding echo-chamber effects, and protecting the role of scientific expertise in social policy.","2017","2025-07-26 09:58:25","2025-07-26 09:58:25","","6262-6267","","24","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vivo studies in mice have shown how abnormal Nrg-ErbB4 signaling leads to deviant behaviors relevant to distinct aspects of schizophrenia, including hyperactivity, sensory gating deficits, working and spatial memory deficits and impaired social behavior. However, so far little is known on the role of ErbB4 in attention and inhibitory control, two aspects of executive functions that are impaired in schizophrenia. Here we investigated the effects of constitutive loss of ErbB4 in the central nervous system of mice on performance in a 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) assessing attention and inhibitory control. In this task, ErbB4<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not show deficits in various parameters of attention, and premature responses as measure of inhibitory control. Nonetheless, ErbB4<sup>-/-</sup> mice recapitulated a specific set of behavioral phenotypes associated with schizophrenia, including a deficit in spatial learning and memory in the Barnes Maze and in contextual fear learning, and a trend for a deficit in sensorimotor gating. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of acute pharmacological inhibition of ErbB tyrosine kinase receptor using the pan-ErbB kinase inhibitor JNJ-28871063 (JNJ), in an automated version of the 5CSRTT. JNJ did not affect attention and inhibitory control. In conclusion, our data suggest no direct involvement of a classical Nrg-ErbB4 pathway in attention and inhibitory control in mice, while it confirms the involvement of this pathway in other domains relevant to schizophrenia.","2017","2025-07-26 09:58:25","2025-07-26 09:58:25","","56-69","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the crucial role of entrepreneurial employees with regard to innovation and competitive advantage, research has increased and various concepts have emerged. Despite the growing interest in the field, intrapreneurship is still lacking a clear classification of the related concepts as research has thus far been based on diverse theoretical approaches. Indeed, contributions in the field are fragmented, using various definitions. There is no systematic review providing an overview of the field. By distinguishing between corporate entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial orientation and intrapreneurship, this paper clearly positions intrapreneurship as individual-level concept. Most prior research has been done at the organizational level, focusing on concepts such as corporate entrepreneurship, but research concentrating on individual intrapreneurial employees is rare. Therefore, this paper closes the gap by performing a systematic literature review and using a narrow focus to present the current state of research with regard to the individual-level perspective on intrapreneurship. The results of the review make it possible to identify five different research streams based on the analytical levels applied. The research streams examined used various lenses and cover business, technological and academic contexts. In a final step, the findings and possible research agendas are integrated in a model that serves as the basis for future research initiatives. Hence the paper offers the possibility of a clearer justification for future research and is a first step towards a holistic research model related to intrapreneurship.","2018","2025-07-26 09:58:26","2025-07-26 14:41:51","","919-961","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this study shows how opinion-making physicians in strategic arenas (i.e. national professional bodies, conferences and high-impact journals) advocate to reform medical professionalism by discursively framing physicians as leaders. The aim of this article is to critically investigate the use of leadership discourse by these opinion-making physicians. By performing a discursive analysis of key documents produced in these strategic arenas and additional observations of national conferences, this article investigates how leadership discourse is used and to what purpose. The following key uses of medical leadership discourses were identified: (1) regaining the lead in medical professionalism, (2) disrupting 'old' professional values, and (3) constructing the 'modern' physician. The analysis reveals that physicians as 'leaders' are expected to become team-players that work across disciplinary and organizational boundaries to improve the quality and affordability of care. In comparison to management that is negatively associated with NPM reform, leadership discourse is linked to positive institutional change, such as decentralization and integration of care. Yet, it is unclear to what extent leadership discourses are actually incorporated on the work floor and to what effect. Future studies could therefore investigate the uptake of leadership discourses by rank and file physicians to investigate whether leadership discourses are used in restricting or empowering ways.","2018","2025-07-26 09:58:26","2025-07-26 09:58:26","","68-75","","","212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim was to compare estimates on sepsis incidence and mortality based on different ICD-code abstraction strategies and to assess their validity for sepsis case identification based on a patient sample not pre-selected for presence of sepsis codes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the national DRG-statistics for assessment of population-level sepsis incidence and mortality. Cases were identified by three previously published International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding strategies for sepsis based on primary and secondary discharge diagnoses (clinical sepsis codes (R-codes), explicit coding (all sepsis codes) and implicit coding (combined infection and organ dysfunction codes)). For the validation study, a stratified sample of 1120 adult patients admitted to a German academic medical center between 2007-2013 was selected. Administrative diagnoses were compared to a gold standard of clinical sepsis diagnoses based on manual chart review. RESULTS: In the validation study, 151/937 patients had sepsis. Explicit coding strategies performed better regarding sensitivity compared to R-codes, but had lower PPV. The implicit approach was the most sensitive for severe sepsis; however, it yielded a considerable number of false positives. R-codes and explicit strategies underestimate sepsis incidence by up to 3.5-fold. Between 2007-2013, national sepsis incidence ranged between 231-1006/100,000 person-years depending on the coding strategy. CONCLUSIONS: In the sample of a large tertiary care hospital, ICD-coding strategies for sepsis differ in their accuracy.

Because extant work design research has tended to examine the direct and mediating effects of autonomy on work outcomes such as job satisfaction, examinations of more situational elements and the degree to which the organizational context strengthens or weakens this relationship has been neglected. This study, therefore, takes a context-contingent perspective to investigate the degree to which psychological climate dimensions such as supervisor support, organizational structure and organizational innovation moderate the effects of autonomy (work scheduling autonomy, work methods autonomy, decision-making autonomy) on employee perceived innovative work behavior (IWB). Using a conjoint experiment based on 9,440 assessments nested within 1,180 employees, it was found that all autonomy dimensions had a significant direct effect on employee perceived IWB. Contrary to the Hypotheses, the multi-level analysis did not reveal any moderating effect of the climate dimensions on the relationship between autonomy and employee IWB. This study provides a context-contingent view for the features of work design and gives a more detailed analysis of autonomy, which has previously been seen primarily as a unidimensional construct.","2018","2025-07-26 09:58:27","2025-07-26 09:58:27","","e0204089","","10","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed risk adjusted secular trends in sepsis and infection epidemiology in Germany.MethodsRetrospective cohort study using nationwide German hospital discharge data. We assessed incidence, outcomes and trends of hospital-treated sepsis and infections between 2010 and 2015. Sepsis was identified by explicit ICD-10 sepsis codes. As sensitivity analysis, results were compared with sepsis cases identified by implicit sepsis coding (combined infection and organ dysfunction codes).ResultsAmong 18 664 877 hospital admissions in 2015, 4 213 116 (22.6%) patients had at least one infection code. There were 320 198 patients that had explicit sepsis codes including 136 542 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock; 183 656 patients were coded as sepsis without organ dysfunction. For patients with explicitly coded sepsis (including severe sepsis), or with severe sepsis alone, mortality rates over the period 2010–2015 decreased from 26.6 to 23.5%, and from 47.8 to 41.7%, respectively.ConclusionsSepsis and infection remain significant causes of hospital admission and death in Germany. Sepsis-related mortality is higher and has declined to a lesser degree than in other high-income countries. Although infection rates steadily increased, the observed annual increase of sepsis cases seems to result, to a considerable degree, from improved coding of sepsis.","2018","2025-07-26 09:58:28","2025-07-26 09:58:28","","1826-1835","","11","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is now offered direct-to-consumer, thereby referred to as direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT). Criticisms have been expressed on whether a truly informed decision to undergo testing is made with regard to these services. In order to provide relevant information to achieve this, knowing the characteristics of the expected user population is helpful. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify characteristics of individuals who (1) find the concept of DTC-GT acceptable and (2) consider undergoing DTC-GT in the distant or near future. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated factors associated with acceptability, consideration and intention in the Dutch general population. Studied variables included awareness, principles and how-to knowledge, attitude, innovativeness, and multiple demographic characteristics. Generalised linear models were applied to identify associated variables. RESULTS: Full data was obtained for 836 respondents. Of those, 18.3% found DTC-GT somewhat or totally acceptable, whereas 12.6% considered and 5.5% intended to undergo DTC-GT in the distant or near future. Acceptability was greater with lower principles knowledge, and consideration and intention with lower how-to knowledge. A more positive attitude and greater innovativeness were associated with an increase in all 3 outcomes. CONCLUSION: Informed decision making may be hampered as individuals with lower how-to knowledge were found to be more interested in pursuing testing.

Ideally, JITAIs include effective intervention components, and delivery tailoring is based on effective moderators of intervention effects. Using machine learning techniques to infer each user's context from smartphone sensor data is a promising approach to further enhance tailoring. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to quantify main effects, interactions, and moderators of 3 intervention components of a smartphone-based intervention for physical activity. The secondary objective is the exploration of participants' states of receptivity, that is, situations in which participants are more likely to react to intervention notifications through collection of smartphone sensor data. METHODS: In 2017, we developed the Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally), a chatbot-based mobile health intervention for increasing physical activity that utilizes incentives, planning, and self-monitoring prompts to help participants meet personalized step goals. We used a microrandomized trial design to meet the study objectives. Insurees of a large Swiss insurance company were invited to use the Ally app over a 12-day baseline and a 6-week intervention period. Upon enrollment, participants were randomly allocated to either a financial incentive, a charity incentive, or a no incentive condition. Over the course of the intervention period, participants were repeatedly randomized on a daily basis to either receive prompts that support self-monitoring or not and on a weekly basis to receive 1 of 2 planning interventions or no planning. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire at baseline and postintervention follow-up. RESULTS: Data collection was completed in January 2018. In total, 274 insurees (mean age 41.73 years; 57.7% [158/274] female) enrolled in the study and installed the Ally app on their smartphones. Main reasons for declining participation were having an incompatible smartphone (37/191, 19.4%) and collection of sensor data (35/191, 18.3%). Step data are available for 227 (82.8%, 227/274) participants, and smartphone sensor data are available for 247 (90.1%, 247/274) participants.

The important role of intermediary stakeholders that help to facilitate such partnerships is under-researched. This paper examines the work of three intermediary stakeholders in the Canadian innovation ecosystem-the Canadian Science Policy Centre, the MaRS Discovery District, and university Vice Presidents Research. By interviewing 40 experts from the federal and provincial governments, non-governmental organizations, industry, and the higher education sector in Ontario, this study examines how innovation ecosystems are created and what factors influence the success of bringing diverse stakeholders together. The findings suggest that strong political vision and leadership, an inclusive approach to recognizing the needs of diverse stakeholders, and clarity on ways to measure and fund innovation serve as important factors in the Canadian innovation ecosystem.","2018","2025-07-26 09:58:29","2025-07-26 09:58:29","","1-19","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluates the effects of two types of small financial incentives within a physical activity promotion program of a Swiss health insurance company. STUDY DESIGN: Three-arm cluster-randomized trial comparing small personal financial incentives and charity financial incentives (10 Swiss Francs, equal to US$10.40) for each month with an average step count of >10,000 steps per day to control. Insureds' federal state of residence was the unit of randomization. Data were collected in 2015 and analyses were completed in 2018. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: German-speaking insureds of a large health insurer in Switzerland were invited. Invited insureds were aged ≥18 years, enrolled in complementary insurance plans and registered on the insurer's online platform. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the participation rate. Secondary outcomes were steps per day, the proportion of participant days in which >10,000 steps were achieved and non-usage attrition over the first 3 months of the program. RESULTS: Participation rate was 5.94% in the personal financial incentive group (OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.55, 2.49) and 4.98% in the charity financial incentive group (OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.25, 2.01) compared with 3.23% in the control group. At the start of the program, the charity financial group had a 12% higher chance of walking 10,000 steps per day than the control group (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.23, 2.30), but this effect dissipated after 3 months. Steps per day and non-usage attrition did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Small personal and charity financial incentives can increase participation in physical activity promotion programs. Incentives may need to be modified in order to prevent attrition and promote behavior change over a longer period of time.

Although each of these units shares a commitment to scholarship, there is no synthetic framework to accurately represent and evaluate their activities and contributions. This study aimed to provide such a framework. METHOD: The authors examined data collected from 11 U.S. HPESU directors. Interviews occurred between April 2015 and February 2016. The research team used a combination of deductive and inductive qualitative techniques to analyze the interview transcripts. The deductive portion drew on Boyer's four-part framework of scholarship; the inductive portion produced a new conceptualization of scholarship at the HPESU level. RESULTS: The scholarly activities of HPESUs generally align with Boyer's four types of scholarship-discovery, integration, application, and teaching. However, this categorization fails to capture the interconnectedness and variety of purposes served by these activities. Both are important when considering how best to represent the scholarly contributions made by HPESUs. From their analysis of interviews, the authors developed a three-part framework characterizing HPESU scholarly activities: supporting a scholarly approach to education, supporting educational scholarship within the institution, and supporting HPESU members' scholarship. CONCLUSIONS: The authors contend that the three-part, unit-level framework for scholarship constructed in this study brings clarity and understanding to the purpose, activities, and contributions made by HPESUs in the United States. The proposed framework may allow unit directors to better justify and advocate for the resources needed to further promote the work of HPESUs.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:29","2025-07-26 09:58:29","","&na;","","&NA;","Publish Ahead of Print","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The BAHS consists of an implant in the skull that breeches the skin. Soft tissue reactions are a common complication associated with BAHS and are generally poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the influence of BAHS and associated skin reactions around the implant. A total of 45 patients were prospectively followed from implantation up to at least 1 year. Swabs were obtained at baseline, 12 weeks follow-up and during cases of inflammation (Holgers score ≥2). The microbiota was assessed using IS-pro<sup>TM</sup>, a bacterial profiling method based on the interspace region between the 16S-23S rRNA genes. Detection of operational taxonomic units, the Shannon Diversity Index, sample similarity analyses and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were employed. <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis</i>, <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>, <i>Staphylococcus capitis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus hominis</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i>, <i>Bordetella</i> spp., <i>Streptococcus sanguinis</i>, <i>Peptostreptococcus anaerobius</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>, and <i>Citrobacter koseri</i> were the most commonly found bacterial species. <i>S. pneumoniae/mitis</i> was significantly more often observed after implantation, whereas <i>P. acnes</i> was significantly less observed after implantation compared with baseline. The relative abundance of <i>S. epidermidis</i> (17%) and <i>S. aureus</i> (19.4%) was the highest for the group of patients with inflammation. The Shannon Diversity Index was significantly increased after implantation compared with pre-surgical swabs for Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia (FAFV), but not for other phyla. When combining all phyla, there was no significant increase in the Shannon Diversity Index. The diversity index was similar post-surgically for patients experiencing inflammation and for patients without inflammation. With a supervised classifier (PLS-DA), patients prone to inflammation could be identified at baseline with an accuracy of 91.7%. In addition, PLS-DA could classify post-surgical abutments as non-inflamed or inflamed with an accuracy of 97.7%. This study shows the potential of using IS-pro<sup>TM</sup> to describe and quantify the microbiota associated with the percutaneous BAHS. Furthermore, the results indicate the possibility of an early identification of patients susceptible to adverse skin reaction following implantation. Both <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. epidermidis</i> should be considered as relevant bacteria for BAHS-associated inflammation.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:29","2025-07-26 09:58:29","","799","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to start-ups dedicated to a green mission, diversifying into green markets by developing new products based on existing core competences has proven to be challenging. This is because the exploration processes to find a match between green technology opportunities and internal competences is complex and new to most established firms. This paper gains insights into exploration processes for green technologies and the learning modes and outcomes linked to these processes. We examined exploration processes at the microlevel in an embedded case study of an engineering firm using a combination of the ""fireworks"" innovation process model and organizational learning theory. First, we found that developing green technologies involves a long-term exploratory process without guarantee of (quick) success and likely involves many exploration failures. Second, as exploration unfolds along multiple technology trajectories, learning occurs in individual exploration paths (on-path), when new paths are pursued (path-initiation), and when knowledge from one path is spilled over to subsequent paths (across-paths). Third, to increase their chances for success, firms can increase the efficiency of exploration by fostering a failure-friendly organizational culture, deliberately experimenting, and purposefully learning from failures.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:29","2025-07-26 09:58:29","","970-988","","6","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This subjective deliberation process is simultaneously influenced by factors operating at the intra-organizational and regional level, as well as the field in which the university is located. A model that takes this multilevel environment into account is applied to a single case study region: Kaiserslautern (Germany). A Q-methodological approach is employed to reveal and analyze the aforementioned subjective perspectives regarding drivers of universities' regional engagement. Two key viewpoints emerge from this analysis: one perspective reflects a highly institutionalized reading of regional engagement, and can be traced to the strong policy push to create universities as drivers of regional development in the Palatinate. The second perspective recognizes greater diversity among the various engagement activities pursued by universities beyond this narrow institutional engagement, driven through individual interaction with regional partners. These insights question the widespread pipeline-dominated perspective on universities' regional engagement and argue for a more systemic understanding of the role of higher education institutions within their region.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:30","2025-07-26 09:58:30","","170-185","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing complexity amplifies fragmentation of care and results in sub optimal care outcomes. Ireland, in keeping with other jurisdictions seeks to implement integrated care for older persons as a policy response. There is growing evidence base supporting effective service responses for older persons. These typically include multidisciplinary, community based teams providing services in or near to the older person’s home (the ‘what’). However, examples of systemic implementation are confined to smaller regions notably in Catalonia (Spain), Scotland and Singapore. This reflects the fact that the implementation of integrated care is problematic at scale. The need to attend to methods that support high autonomy professionals tasked with local implementation (the ‘who’) is a neglected area. This is especially important in light of the fact managerial and clinical leaders already have operational and clinical imperatives to attend to. Whilst ideologically committed, the change management challenge presented by integrated care is daunting as they may lack the capacity (time, resources, structures) required to test a new care model. In addition, most change methodologies fail to recognise powerful social dynamics that reflect the characteristics of a complex adaptive system (the ‘how’). This paper proposes a framework to implementing integrated care for older persons. In addition, it offers some initial empirical evidence that this approach has utility among managers and clinicians. In doing so seeks to bridge the implementation gap associated with systemic change.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:30","2025-07-26 09:58:30","","288-304","","3","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about the implementation of CWLs and the factors that influence implementation outcomes of such primary care innovations. The purpose of this paper is to explain variations in the outcomes of implementation by analyzing the characteristics of CWLs and contextual factors that influence their implementation. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A multiple qualitative case study was conducted. Four contrasting CWLs were purposefully selected: two relatively high-performing and two relatively low-performing cases with regard to process indicators. Data collected between 2015 and 2016 drew on three sources: 26 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, 22 documents and field notes. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to identify, through a cross-case comparison of ratings, constructs that distinguish high from low-performing cases. FINDINGS: Five constructs distinguished high from low-performing cases: three related to the inner setting: network and communications; leadership engagement; available resources; one from innovation characteristics: adaptability with regard to registration, evaluation of priority and attachment to a family physician; and, one associated with process domain: engaging. Other constructs exerted influence on implementation (e.g. outer setting, individual characteristics), but did not distinguish high and low-performing cases.

The role is presented as a malleable construct cascading through and sensitive to structure-agency interaction at different levels of NHS England: the sector, organisation and department. At the core of the analysis is the permissiveness of structures established at the respective levels of the NHS, facilitating or restricting agency as the role progresses through the healthcare system. A permissive regulatory framework at the sector level is reflected in the different choices made by two case study NHS acute hospital trusts, in their engagement with the AP role. These different choices have consequences for how the AP impacts at the departmental level.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:31","2025-07-26 09:58:31","","1667-1684","","8","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We do this to explore whether and how they are functioning as institutional entrepreneurs (IE) at the local service delivery level. In one health district, between 2013 and 2015, we carried out 59 in-depth interviews with district, sub-district and facility managers, nurses, DCST members and external actors. We also ran one focus group discussion with the DCST and analysed key policies, activities and perceptions of the innovation using an institutional entrepreneurship conceptual lens. Findings show that the DCST is located in a constrained context. Yet, by revealing and bridging gaps in the health system, team members have been able to take on certain IE characteristics, functioning-more or less-as announcers of reforms, articulating a strategic vision and direction for the system, advocating for change, mobilizing resources. In addition, they have helped to reorganize services and shape care practices by re-framing issues and exerting power to influence organizational change. The DCST innovation provides an opportunity to promote institutional entrepreneurship in our context because it influences change and is applicable to other health systems. Yet there are nuanced differences between individual members and the team, and these need better understanding to maximize this contribution to change in this context and other health systems.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:32","2025-07-26 09:58:32","","ii121-ii134","","Supplement_2","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Canada, the University of Montreal has developed a model which consists in partnering with patient advisors, providers, and managers in quality improvement. This model was introduced through its Partners in Care Programs tested with several quality improvement teams in Quebec, Canada. Partnering with patients in quality improvement brings about new challenges for healthcare managers. This model is recent, and little is known about how managers contribute to implementing and sustaining it using key practices.MethodsIn-depth multi-level case studies were conducted within two healthcare organizations which have implemented a Partners in Care Program in quality improvement. The longitudinal design of this research enabled us to monitor the implementation of patient partnership initiatives from 2015 to 2017. In total, 38 interviews were carried out with managers at different levels (top-level, mid-level, and front-line) involved in the implementation of Partners in Care Programs. Additionally, seven focus groups were conducted with patients and providers.ResultsOur findings show that managers are engaged in four main types of practices: 1-designing the patient partnership approach so that it makes sense to the entire organization; 2-structuring patient partnership to support its deployment and sustainability; 3-managing patient advisor integration in quality improvement to avoid tokenistic involvement; 4-evaluating patient advisor integration to support continuous improvement. Designing and structuring patient partnership are based on typical management practices used to implement change initiatives in healthcare organizations, whereas managing and evaluating patient advisor integration require new daily practices from managers. Our results reveal that managers at all levels, from top to front-line, are concerned with the implementation of patient partnership in quality improvement.ConclusionThis research adds empirical support to the evidence regarding daily managerial practices used for implementing patient partnership initiatives in quality improvement and contributes to guiding healthcare organizations and managers when integrating such approaches.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:32","2025-07-26 09:58:32","","815","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The institutional entrepreneurship of public health researchers concerns the opportunity to improve the norms regulating social media companies by engaging the public and private sectors. Beyond the clarification of concepts, the contribution of the commentary is to demonstrate why public health researchers committed to institutional entrepreneurship should mind the mental model they employ to think about business regulation. The popular Chicago School model negates the legitimacy of corporate policy making that trades profits for public health. Thinking this way obscures the relevance of institutional entrepreneurship by stipulating that corporations should answer to shareholders and government but not civil society. Though digital health communication is consistent with the Chicago School picture, the alternative public-private model reinforces opportunities for digital health communication as well as institutional entrepreneurship. The commentary proposes a toolkit for public health researchers to consciously open up to opportunities for institutional entrepreneurship in digital public health.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:32","2025-07-26 09:58:32","","30s-36s","","2_suppl","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since travellers consult and produce online travel reviews (OTR) before and during a trip, this research aims to provide and implement a framework for analysing OTRs of dining establishments to measure their contribution to destination image formation in their designative (cognitive) and appraisive (affective and evaluative) aspects. To do this, a website was selected from which to download OTRs, extract useful information from the textual and paratextual elements, build a keyword frequency matrix, and perform a quantitative and thematic content analysis. This method was applied to a random sample of 500,000 OTRs from the TripAdvisor restaurants section, written in English, between 2013 and 2017, by tourists visiting the Canary Islands. Results show that, although the gastronomic image of the destination is positive in general, the local and regional gastronomy representative of the community's sociocultural identity is not the most popular nor the best valued in tourists' comments. This research shows a method to measure the main aspects that make up the gastronomic image of a destination and that allow for extracting insights and business intelligence through big data from user-generated content.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:33","2025-07-26 09:58:33","","4631","","23","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The power of the medical school, arising out of the ikyoku system in the context of chronic shortages of physicians and the respect afforded to physicians by wider society, was played out in the hospital, with cost management taking a back seat. We find that the general patterns of interaction between and among key stakeholders in relation to accountability and the governance process are shaped by some form of verticality, monologues rather than dialogues, indirectness and silence rooted in Japanese cultural context. Cultural political economy approach guided us to examine both semiotic and extra semiotic features and their dialectical moments with key actors in assessing the limits of NPMs in non-Western contexts.","2019","2025-07-26 09:58:33","2025-07-26 09:58:33","","112719","","","245","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organization refers to process driven by attempts to decide for others and shows affinity with markets for standardized and homogenous products, for example, stock exchanges. Organization also accounts for the making of marketplaces.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of incentives, weekly planning, and daily self-monitoring prompts that were used as intervention components as part of the Ally app. METHODS: We conducted an 8 week optimization trial with n = 274 insurees of a health insurance company in Switzerland. At baseline, participants were randomized to different incentive conditions (cash incentives vs. charity incentives vs. no incentives). Over the course of the study, participants were randomized weekly to different planning conditions (action planning vs. coping planning vs. no planning) and daily to receiving or not receiving a self-monitoring prompt. Primary outcome was the achievement of personalized daily step goals. RESULTS: Study participants were more active and healthier than the general Swiss population. Daily cash incentives increased step-goal achievement by 8.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.1, 14.1] and, only in the no-incentive control group, action planning increased step-goal achievement by 5.8%, 95% CI: [1.2, 10.4]. Charity incentives, self-monitoring prompts, and coping planning did not affect physical activity. Engagement with planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts was low and 30% of participants stopped using the app over the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Daily cash incentives increased physical activity in the short term. Planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts require revision before they can be included in future versions of the app. Selection effects and engagement can be important challenges for physical-activity apps.

After the exposure, heavy drinkers reported a significantly higher craving than occasional drinkers. Post-immersion alcohol craving was significantly related to the levels of perceived ecological validity of the virtual environment. Finally, a moderation analysis suggested that the levels of craving more strongly increased with perceived ecological validity in heavy drinkers than in occasional drinkers.

Coronary obstruction and subsequent myocardial ischemia result in progressive replacement of contractile myocardium with dysfunctional, fibrotic scar tissue. Post-infarctional remodeling is causal for the concomitant decline of left-ventricular function and the fatal syndrome of heart failure. Available neurohumoral treatment strategies aim at the improvement of symptoms. Despite extensive research, therapeutic options for myocardial regeneration, including (stem)-cell therapy, gene therapy, cellular reprogramming or tissue engineering, remain purely experimental. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need for novel treatment options for inducing myocardial regeneration and improving left-ventricular function in ischemic cardiomyopathy.Shockwave Therapy (SWT) is a well-established regenerative tool that is effective for the treatment of chronic tendonitis, long-bone non-union and wound-healing disorders. In preclinical trials, SWT regenerated ischemic myocardium via the induction of angiogenesis and the reduction of fibrotic scar tissue, resulting in improved left-ventricular function.Methods/designIn this prospective, randomized controlled, single-blind, monocentric study, 80 patients with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF≤ 40%) are subjected to coronary-artery bypass-graft surgery (CABG) surgery and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive additional cardiac SWT (intervention group; 40 patients) or CABG surgery with sham treatment (control group; 40 patients). This study aims to evaluate (1) the safety and (2) the efficacy of cardiac SWT as adjunctive treatment during CABG surgery for the regeneration of ischemic myocardium.

Significantly, student co-creation, of the curriculum, has become increasingly important. Yet there is limited research which addresses how to engage this group in design processes. METHODS: This paper represents the first phase of a three stage action research spiral whereby the authors evaluated the use of a novel tool for curriculum design processes, anonymised crowdsourcing. This initial phase was open to all students enrolled on an undergraduate diagnostic radiography programme in the UK. To confirm the reliability of the crowdsource design an established eight point crowdsourcing verification tool was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-three unique ideas were generated by participants, 40 comments made and 173 votes cast. Inductive analysis of the comments generated five themes. These included: the role of technology enhanced learning; simulation activities; patient focused curriculum; mental wealth (resilience) authentic assessment approaches. An evaluation of those who had and had not engaged highlighted areas of improvement for the administration of the second and third iterations which will include a wider pool of participants. CONCLUSION: This study from a single programme offers lessons for others wishing to adopt and develop this approach elsewhere. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Several ideas elicited by the crowdsource have been considered by the curriculum design team and will be implemented in the 2020 curriculum thus demonstrating the impact on local education practice of this research approach.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:40","2025-07-26 09:58:40","","s54-s61","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Case studies of startups related to biopharmaceutical research topics suggest that the biopharmaceutical field has rich opportunities stemming from scientific research, commercialization, and entrepreneurship. This evaluation method sorts specific industry segments by which financing activities are active, and by which related growing research topics attract increased academic attention. We constructed networks of author citation and co-authorship from paper citation networks related to research topics in industry segments in the biopharmaceutical domain. Results obtained across all research topics we surveyed demonstrated that authors in the top 10% of degree centrality ranking in both networks are far more likely to be startup participants than other authors.

Regional resilience is a place-sensitive, multi-layered and multi-scalar, conflict-ridden and highly contingent process. The nature of shocks is one important impact factor on regional resilience. Arguably, so far, most literature on regional resilience has dealt with the financial crisis in 2008/2009. In this research note, we will analyse both the particular characteristics of the current COVID-19 crisis, as well as its effects on regional recovery and potential resilience in China, where it started.

Based on the personality development theory, a recommendation algorithm system for entrepreneurial projects under optimized deep neural network was established. A total of 518 college students from several universities were divided into an experimental group and a control group, with 259 students in each group. In addition to the normal courses of entrepreneurship psychology education, students in the experimental group were taught the entrepreneurship project recommendation system based on the optimized deep neural network designed in this research, while students in the control group were taught entrepreneurship psychology education normally. The intervention effect before and after entrepreneurship education was evaluated by the questionnaire of college students' entrepreneurial intention and college students' entrepreneurial mental resilience scale. The results demonstrate that the system recall rate and accuracy based on the algorithm in this research have been significantly higher than that of PMF algorithm and deep belief network (DBN) algorithm, and the difference is statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed algorithm is significantly smaller than that of PMF algorithm and DBN algorithm, and the difference is statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); the improvement of entrepreneurial toughness, entrepreneurial strength, optimism, entrepreneurial possibility, and behavioral tendency of the experimental group after the test was significantly higher than that of the control group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed method for entrepreneurial projects based on the theory of personality development and the optimized deep neural network shows better performance, and it can effectively improve the entrepreneurial intention and psychological resilience of college students.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:41","2025-07-26 09:58:41","","1346","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We study the role of parliament connecting policy makers and stakeholders in the context of drug regulation. Based on three high-profile cases of drug withdrawals between 1991 and 2005 in the United Kingdom (triazolam, rofecoxib, and co-proxamol), we distinguish partisan-political, individual-idiosyncratic, and collective-institutional pathways of parliamentary action on drug withdrawals. Distinguishing direct and indirect actions, we argue that indirect courses of action, including advocacy and educational work, can be just as effective as regular legislative endeavours, under certain conditions.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:41","2025-07-26 09:58:41","","984-990","","9","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, we explored the distribution tendencies of the support needs at different entrepreneurial stages. We found that the support needs of college student entrepreneurs can be divided into 20 types, which can be categorized into core support needs (six types), secondary support needs (six types), and marginal support needs (eight types) in descending order of importance. A cross-stage analysis indicates that the support needs differ during the different entrepreneurial stages. While the needs during the entrepreneurial preparation stage and the startup stage have many similarities, those during the entrepreneurial failure stage are significantly different from those of the other three stages examined, showing heterogeneity. In addition, we identified psychological counseling as an important core support need in the failure stage and demonstrate its critical role in helping college students out of the shadow of entrepreneurial failure. This study expands the research on entrepreneurial support needs. Its findings provide valuable information to help colleges and governments develop more targeted and appropriate support for college entrepreneurs based on entrepreneurial stages to promote entrepreneurial success.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:41","2025-07-26 09:58:41","","1428","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. METHODS: We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms ""conversational agents,"" ""conversational AI,"" ""chatbots,"" and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. CONCLUSIONS: The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence-driven, and smartphone app-delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents' formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:41","2025-07-26 09:58:41","","e17158","","8","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, there are no large clinical trial available to reliably document the efficacy of delivering videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP) for people with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) and whether basic psychotherapeutic processes are altered. METHODS: This 2-arm intent-to-treat non-inferiority study reports on a clinical trial on VCP and documents how therapeutic working alliance and motivation toward psychotherapy are associated to treatment outcome. We hypothesized that VCP would not be inferior to standard face-to-face (FF) cognitive behavior therapy for PDA. No specific hypothesis was stated to address working alliance and treatment mechanisms. VCP was compared to a gold-standard psychotherapy treatment for PDA, which was delivered either in person or in videoconference, with a strict tolerance criterion of about 2 points on the primary outcome measure. Seventy one adult patients were recruited. Measures of working alliance were collected after the first, fifth, and last session. Motivation toward therapy at pre-treatment and working alliance after the fifth therapy session were used as predictors of treatment outcome and compared with change in dysfunctional beliefs toward bodily sensations. RESULTS: Panic disorder, agoraphobia, fear of sensations and depressed mood all showed significant improvements and large effect-sizes from pre to post-treatment. Gains were maintained at follow-up. No significant differences were found between VCP and FF, and effect sizes were trivial for three of the four outcome measures. Non-inferiority tests confirmed that VCP was no less effective than FF therapy on the primary outcome measure and two of the three secondary outcome measures. Working alliance was very strong in VCP and did not statistically differ from FF. Working alliance and motivation did not predict treatment outcome, which was significantly predicted by the reduction in dysfunctional beliefs. The strength of the therapeutic bond was correlated with change in dysfunctional beliefs. CONCLUSION: Mental health professionals can use VCP to provide services to patients with PDA. Building and maintaining a sound working alliance should not be a source concern. Practical recommendations are formulated.

This paper investigates two technology business incubators in China and the UK through a comparative lens and offers empirical evidence to support its theoretical argumentation. From a temporal perspective, we found that different types of stakeholders play different roles in deploying three distinctive mechanisms-namely, <i>initiating, orchestrating and partaking</i>-during the developmental trajectory involved in the launch and development of entrepreneurial ventures.

In France, teachers and radiography students in initial training, not specially prepared for this, had to adapt. An evaluation of the system was proposed to the students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire with 4 main sections (pedagogy, communication, learning and concerns) was sent to 91 students at the end of the semester. RESULTS: 91 responses were received. The slideshows with sound or presented during a virtual class are appreciated by the students. Online quizzes are ideal for learning/reviewing. For assessments, individual assignments and online questionnaires are appreciated. Teacher/student interaction via e-mail or video conferencing was considered satisfactory by the large majority of students. Student-student interactions via social networks, for course explanations or document exchange, are very suitable. The majority of students felt they were working a lot and much more compared to face-to-face teaching. Less than half of the students worked more than 20 h per week. Their motivation varied widely. Organizational habits were disrupted, but the autonomy granted was appreciated. The students were mainly concerned about the health of their loved ones and not about their own health. DISCUSSION: The use of distance education tools requires teacher commitment and technical skills. The frequency of communication by e-mail and/or videoconference between members of the teaching team and students must be adapted to the situation. Exchanges by e-mail allow for traceability, while videoconferencing allows direct interaction and a way out of isolation. Autonomy, appreciated by the students, was nevertheless combined with a strong variation in motivation; the anxiety-provoking period in which pedagogical continuity was built up may explain this contradictory observation. CONCLUSION: The results obtained largely confirm the data in the literature. The experience gained through this survey should lead teachers to continue their reflection by test/integrating and evaluating distance education systems, while continuing face-to-face activities.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:42","2025-07-26 09:58:42","","645-653","","4","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper begins with a discussion of the authors' methodology before moving to a literature review addressing VCP’s and related elements of entrepreneurial education best practice. It then shifts to a critical discussion of the authors' experiences based on insights, student and staff evaluations, and course data. In the process of conducting this review the authors found that good pedagogical design, in a VCP context, needs to focus on ensuring that academics promote constructive alignment between the curriculum that is ‘taught’, the teaching methods used, the learning environment chosen and the assessment procedures adopted. Only by minimising inconsistencies which link these factors will students’ experiences of venture creation be fully engaging, promoting more effective, experiential and entrepreneurial development. This paper provides educators with an original and experiential insight into the design of a VCP programme and the pedagogical developments required for their successful implementation.

Prospective Shifts in International Haute Cuisine and Innovation beyond Kitchen and Plate","Foods","","","10.3390/foods9101369","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131282096","Haute cuisine, the cooking style for fine dining at gourmet restaurants, has changed over the last decades and can be expected to evolve in the upcoming years. To engage in foresight, the purpose of this study is to identify a plausible future trend scenario for the haute cuisine sector within the next five to ten years, based on today's chefs' views. To achieve this goal, an international, two-stage Delphi study was conducted. The derived scenario suggests that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will lead to significant restaurant bankruptcies and will raise creativity and innovation among the remaining ones. It is expected that haute cuisine tourism will grow and that menu prices will differ for customer segments. More haute cuisine restaurants will open in Asia and America. Local food will remain a major trend and will be complemented by insect as well as plant-based proteins and sophisticated nonalcoholic food pairings. Restaurant design and the use of scents will become more relevant. Also, private dining and fine dining at home will become more important. The scenario also includes negative projections. These findings can serve as a research agenda for future research in haute cuisine, including the extension of the innovation lens towards the restaurant and the business model.

The results show that innovation is affected positively by board size, especially in the case of family businesses, and gender diversity, especially in non-family businesses. Similarly, findings also point out that duality is better than the independence of functions in the case of non-family businesses. Finally, obtained results support that independent directors have a negative impact on innovation and such negative influence is even stronger in family firms. These findings contribute to an inconclusive literature regarding board effects on innovation, highlighting different recommendations depending on whether the companies are family businesses or not.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:44","2025-07-26 09:58:44","","e04980","","9","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regardless of the growing number of studies in innovation management there is still a lack of research that integrates and synthesizes this body of knowledge. Our review of 93 articles from Web of Science and Scopus databases, including content analysis, presents trends and research background in innovation management that use the mixed methods approach. This study addresses the inconsistencies in the literature and presents a holistic picture of what existing empirical studies have found to date. In addition, we have developed an innovation management model based on selected theoretical lenses to enable future researchers in a given area to choose the appropriate method. The results of the meta-summary show that 50.54% articles from our dataset are related to partially mixed dominant sequential methods, 12.90% fully mixed dominant sequential methods and 11.83% fully mixed dominant concurrent methods. We identified several research gaps and provided a future research avenue in the context of innovation management. The article analyzes empirical papers, enables identification of problems in the current research and identifies trends in the area of the studied phenomenon. The results on the topic of mixed methods in innovation management and used tools have indicated that this issue is still in a premature phase but with an upward trend of research development.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:44","2025-07-26 09:58:44","","252","","11","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing knowledge provides insight into factors that may facilitate or hinder successful intersectoral action, but not much is known about how intersectoral action evolves and becomes embedded in local health policies. This is where this study aims to make its contribution, by adopting the multilevel perspective on transitions, which is increasingly used to study social innovation in sustainability transitions but has not yet been applied to public health and health promotion. Through this perspective, it was unravelled how intersectoral action between youth-care organizations and community sports clubs became embedded in local health policies of Rotterdam, a large city in the Netherlands. A single explorative case study was conducted based on content analysis of policy documents and 15 in-depth interviews with policy officers, managers and field workers operating in the fields of youth and sports in Rotterdam. The findings showed that intersectoral action between community organizations and policymakers evolves through congruent processes at different levels that changed institutional logics. Moreover, it emerged that policymakers and other actors that advocate novel social practices and act as boundary spanners can adopt multiple strategies to embed these practices in local health policy. The multi-level perspective adds value to earlier approaches to research intersectoral collaboration for health promotion as it allows to better capture the politics involved in the social innovation processes. However, further sharpening and more comprehensive application of transition concepts to study transitions in public health and health promotion is needed.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:45","2025-07-26 09:58:45","","1050-1061","","4","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neonatal care is emblematic of these acute services as averting deaths requires skilled care over many days from multiple professionals with at least basic equipment. However, hospital care is often of poor quality and large-scale change is needed to improve outcomes. In this manuscript we aim to show how we have drawn upon our understanding of contexts of care in Kenyan general hospital NBUs, and on social and behavioural theories that offer potential mechanisms of change in these settings, to develop an initial programme theory guiding a large scale change intervention to improve neonatal care and outcomes. Our programme theory is an expression of our assumptions about what actions will be both useful and feasible. It incorporates a recognition of our strengths and limitations as a research-practitioner partnership to influence change. The steps we employ represent the initial programme theory development phase commonly undertaken in many Realist Evaluations. However, unlike many Realist Evaluations that develop initial programme theories focused on pre-existing interventions or programmes, our programme theory informs the design of a new intervention that we plan to execute. Within this paper we articulate briefly how we propose to operationalise this new intervention. Finally, we outline the quantitative and qualitative research activities that we will use to address specific questions related to the delivery and effects of this new intervention, discussing some of the challenges of such study designs. We intend that this research on the intervention will inform future efforts to revise the programme theory and yield transferable learning.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:45","2025-07-26 09:58:45","","265","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lessons from the COVID‐19 pandemic crisis","R&D Management","","","10.1111/radm.12444","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132671630","The rapid emergence of the COVID‐19 crisis has challenged both private and public firms, requiring them to reshape their internal processes and external linkages in the fight against the virus, but also to survive the disrupting economic impact of the pandemic on their activities. Academic spinoffs have not been exempted from these dynamics. In this paper, we present and discuss a case study of an academic spinoff, Omnidermal, which has developed a new, efficient and easy‐to‐realize emergency life support machine for use in intensive and sub‐intensive care units. This case, apart from offering information on the best practices of how spinoffs may contribute socially to the fight against COVID‐19 and – more in general – against other exogenous shocks, also provides insights on their stages of development, evolution patterns and ability to define new solutions. The case shows that when the market needs are clear to a firm (as in the case of medical devices during the COVID‐19 crisis), the ‘legacy competences and practices’ of spinoffs (i.e., technical competences and work practices) can be fully exploited to compress the development time and to realize products demanded by the market. We also identify access to a network as being an essential boundary condition for this process. These results introduce an alternative scope for academic spinoffs. Given the ‘legacy competences and practices’ they are able to develop, they are ideal candidates to respond to the societal and economic challenges posed by a crisis over short periods of time. On the basis of these insights, we draw a series of implications for practitioners, policy makers and academics.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:45","2025-07-26 09:58:45","","169-182","","2","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This matter is of the utmost importance, as it helps to facilitate the implementation of measures that can ensure the future recovery of the economy and the creation of new businesses. The objective of this paper is to study the institutional and psychological antecedents of entrepreneurial intention and the role of gender. The theory of planned behaviour is applied to assess how personal attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control can affect students' intention of becoming an entrepreneur. In addition, organizational support and institutional barriers are tested as potentially significant antecedents of entrepreneurial intention, along with the influence of gender. The research carried out was based on survey responses from a sample of 740 students of economics, communications, and education at an Ecuadorian university. The research propositions were tested using a partial least squares approach. Results indicate that behaviour towards entrepreneurship does not change in relation to gender. In addition, personal attitudes and perceived behavioural control regarding entrepreneurship are positively related to students' entrepreneurial intention. Organizational support is also found to be important for generating entrepreneurial intention. The paper adds to the current knowledge base on entrepreneurial intention by analysing the individual and joint influence of the principal elements of the theory of planned behaviour, as well as organizational support and institutional barriers on entrepreneurial intentions. Moreover, the research provides a useful perspective on the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention in an unexplored context such as Ecuador, by responding to the call focusing on entrepreneurial intention in different regions, cultures, and contexts.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:45","2025-07-26 09:58:45","","8475","","22","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The risk of failures of Start-ups can be minimized if they are characterized well, and the appropriate macro- and micro-level policy interventions can be introduced. Our literature review (LR) on Start-ups reveals that they are addressed by different names, namely, Hi-Tech firms, University spin-offs, Innovative Start-ups (ISs), Lean Start-ups, Silicon Valley Start-ups and New Technology-Based Firms (NTBF). (Tripathi, Seppanen et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2020; Wiesenberg et al., 2020). It is also observed that Start-ups are referred to as small business and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). A systematic literature review (SLR) of Start-ups is presented here and used as the basis for characterizing them. We propose (proposition-1) that these Start-up firms, addressed by different names, as referred above, can be grouped, characterized and identified as ISs. Based on a robust characterization of ISs, this article proposes that ISs are a subset of MSMEs. From a comparative study of ISs and MSME, we propose (proposition-2) a framework that shows MSMEs can be conceptually split into ISs and Conventional MSMEs (C-MSMEs), with an intersection between ISs and C-MSME. This study has also identified four new research areas related to Start-ups and MSMEs. The above characterization and differentiation of ISs from other entrepreneurial ventures will help policymakers, entrepreneurs, and investors to understand ISs and C-MSMEs better and develop suitable policy interventions and risk mitigation strategies.","2020","2025-07-26 09:58:45","2025-07-26 14:53:10","","125-156","","1-2","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also look at the need to properly align public policies and combat climate change while engaging global companies in the process. The SLR shows that more women within the technological innovation process promise greater productivity and better results. It also reveals that women tend to adopt innovations that have proven to be efficient. We argue that more women in science would contribute to accelerating the development of the necessary technological innovation to counter climate change and promote continued awareness about it. We also argue that more female board members in large companies and public institutions would contribute to not only appropriate climate change policies, but also to a move away from “gadget” technologies that fail to effectively fight rising global temperatures.

However, little is known about whether these factors also influence breast tissue composition beyond what is captured by breast density among women with benign breast disease (BBD). METHODS: This analysis included 788 controls from a nested case-control study of breast cancer within the Nurses' Health Study BBD subcohorts. Body fatness at ages 5 and 10 years was recalled using a 9-level pictogram. Weight at age 18, current weight, and height were reported via questionnaires. A deep-learning image analysis was used to quantify the percentages of epithelial, fibrous stromal, and adipose tissue areas within BBD slides. We performed linear mixed models to estimate beta coefficients (β) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the relationships between anthropometrics and the log-transformed percentages of individual tissue type, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Childhood body fatness (level ≥ 4.5 vs. 1), BMI at age 18 (≥23 vs. &lt;19 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and current adult BMI (≥30 vs. &lt;21 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were associated with higher proportions of adipose tissue [β (95% CI) = 0.34 (0.03, 0.65), 0.19 (-0.04-0.42), 0.40 (0.12, 0.68), respectively] and lower proportions of fibrous stromal tissue [-0.05 (-0.10, 0.002), -0.03 (-0.07, 0.003), -0.12 (-0.16, -0.07), respectively] during adulthood (all <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.04).

However, global health systems are not adequately equipped for this extraordinarily time-consuming and cost-intensive development. Here, conversational agents (CAs) can offer easily scalable and ubiquitous support. Moreover, different aspects of CAs have not yet been sufficiently investigated to fully exploit their potential. One such trait is the interaction style between patients and CAs. In human-to-human settings, the interaction style is an imperative part of the interaction between patients and physicians. Patient-physician interaction is recognized as a critical success factor for patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and subsequent treatment outcomes. However, so far, it remains effectively unknown how different interaction styles can be implemented into CA interactions and whether these styles are recognizable by users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop an approach to reproducibly induce 2 specific interaction styles into CA-patient dialogs and subsequently test and validate them in a chronic health care context. METHODS: On the basis of the Roter Interaction Analysis System and iterative evaluations by scientific experts and medical health care professionals, we identified 10 communication components that characterize the 2 developed interaction styles: deliberative and paternalistic interaction styles. These communication components were used to develop 2 CA variations, each representing one of the 2 interaction styles. We assessed them in a web-based between-subject experiment. The participants were asked to put themselves in the position of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These participants were randomly assigned to interact with one of the 2 CAs and subsequently asked to identify the respective interaction style. Chi-square test was used to assess the correct identification of the CA-patient interaction style. RESULTS: A total of 88 individuals (42/88, 48% female; mean age 31.5 years, SD 10.1 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and participated in the web-based experiment. The participants in both the paternalistic and deliberative conditions correctly identified the underlying interaction styles of the CAs in more than 80% of the assessments (X<sup>2</sup><sub>1,88</sub>=38.2; P&lt;.001; phi coefficient r<sub>φ</sub>=0.68). The validation of the procedure was hence successful. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an approach that is tailored for a medical context to induce a paternalistic and deliberative interaction style into a written interaction between a patient and a CA. We successfully tested and validated the procedure in a web-based experiment involving 88 participants. Future research should implement and test this approach among actual patients with chronic diseases and compare the results in different medical conditions. This approach can further be used as a starting point to develop dynamic CAs that adapt their interaction styles to their users.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:46","2025-07-26 09:58:46","","e22919","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Speaker's gender and age also behaviorally manifest in language use, and language may be a powerful tool to shape impact. The present study took the example of TED, a highly successful knowledge dissemination platform, to study online influence. Our goal was to investigate how gender- and age-linked language styles-beyond chronological age and identified gender-link to talk impact and whether this reflects gender and age stereotypes. In a pre-registered study, we collected transcripts of TED Talks along with their impact measures, i.e., views and ratios of positive and negative talk ratings, from the TED website. We scored TED Speakers' (N = 1,095) language with gender- and age-morphed language metrics to obtain measures of female versus male, and younger versus more senior language styles. Contrary to our expectations and to the literature on gender stereotypes, more female language was linked to higher impact in terms of quantity, i.e., more talk views, and this was particularly the case among talks with a lot of views. Regarding quality of impact, language signatures of gender and age predicted different types of positive and negative ratings above and beyond main effects of speaker's gender and age. The differences in ratings seem to reflect common stereotype contents of warmth (e.g., ""beautiful"" for female, ""courageous"" for female and senior language) versus competence (e.g., ""ingenious"", ""informative"" for male language). The results shed light on how verbal behavior may contribute to stereotypical evaluations. They also illuminate how, within new digital social contexts, female language might be uniquely rewarded and, thereby, an underappreciated but highly effective tool for social influence.

There is thus a requirement for the identification and strengthening of entrepreneurial competences, but no previous studies have included any analysis of these competences in the university context using an approach based on profiles. The present study fills this gap by investigating the existence of different entrepreneurial profiles among students, based on their competences. It also defines key competences that are critical for differentiating between these profiles and improving entrepreneurial competence levels more generally. To meet these objectives, a field research campaign was developed. Data on 1104 students from various degrees and faculties were collected and analyzed using a quantitative methodological approach. The results reveal the existence of four entrepreneurial competence profiles, namely <i>low profile</i>, <i>top profile</i>, <i>social profile</i>, and <i>grit profile</i>. Among as many as 12 possible entrepreneurial competences, the most prominent can explain to a large extent the entrepreneurial profiles of students; these are networking and professional social skills, community engagement, perseverance of effort, and consistency of interest.

However, classic breathing training has a limited target group, and retention rates are very low. Although a gameful approach may help overcome these challenges, it is crucial to enable breathing training in a scalable context (eg, smartphone only) and ensure that they remain effective. However, despite the health benefits, no validated mobile gameful breathing training featuring a biofeedback component based on breathing seems to exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the design choices and their implementation in a concrete mobile gameful breathing training app. Furthermore, it aims to deliver an initial validation of the efficacy of the resulting app. METHODS: Previous work was used to derive informed design choices, which, in turn, were applied to build the gameful breathing training app Breeze. In a pretest (n=3), design weaknesses in Breeze were identified, and Breeze was adjusted accordingly. The app was then evaluated in a pilot study (n=16). To ascertain that the effectiveness was maintained, recordings of breathing rates and HRV-derived measures (eg, root mean square of the successive differences [RMSSDs]) were collected. We compared 3 stages: baseline, standard breathing training deployed on a smartphone, and Breeze. RESULTS: Overall, 5 design choices were made: use of cool colors, natural settings, tightly incorporated game elements, game mechanics reflecting physiological measures, and a light narrative and progression model. Breeze was effective, as it resulted in a slow-paced breathing rate of 6 BPM, which, in turn, resulted in significantly increased HRV measures compared with baseline (P<.001 for RMSSD). In general, the app was perceived positively by the participants. However, some criticized the somewhat weaker clarity of the breathing instructions when compared with a standard breathing training app. CONCLUSIONS: The implemented breathing training app Breeze maintained its efficacy despite the use of game elements. Moreover, the app was positively perceived by participants although there was room for improvement.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:46","2025-07-26 09:58:46","","e22802","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach Applied is a systematic literature review using three bibliometric techniques: (1) textual analysis for keywords and abstracts to identify the research hotspots, (2) co-citation analysis of references to identify the evolution of KS and KT in SME and (3) bibliographic coupling analysis of documents to synthesize antecedents and outcomes. Findings A conceptual map emerges from the review to reveal the antecedents of KS and KT at the individual, group and organizational levels. The analysis shows the strategic importance of KS and KT for the SME context. Specific findings include: (1) KS and KT are involved in enhancing SMEs strategic focus for human resources, including organizational learning, customer relations, creativity, higher profit and positive effects on operational processes and decision-making. (2) Innovation, trust and performance are identified as central human factors linked to KS and KT in SMEs. (3) Human resource (HR) management research could contribute to KS and KT in the SME domain by exploring KS- and KT-based practices, linking the emergence of innovation and innovative behaviors to these practices, leading to a better understanding of strategies that enable the long-term storage and retrieval of tacit and explicit knowledge as organizational memory in the SME context. Originality/value This paper is one of the first to systematically review KS and KT in SMEs and propose a concept map. The research adds value to the growing literature of KS and KT and exposes the need for more specific activities to support SME managers, as well as HR managers, who need to facilitate KS and KT in SMEs.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:47","2025-07-26 09:58:47","","1873-1893","","9","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scalable conversational agents, designed to assist health care professionals, may play a significant role in supporting this collaboration in a scalable way by reaching out to the everyday lives of patients and their family members. However, to date, it remains unclear whether conversational agents, in such a role, would be accepted and whether they can support this multistakeholder collaboration. OBJECTIVE: With asthma in children representing a relevant target of chronic disease management, this study had the following objectives: (1) to describe the design of MAX, a conversational agent-delivered asthma intervention that supports health care professionals targeting child-parent teams in their everyday lives; and (2) to assess the (a) reach of MAX, (b) conversational agent-patient working alliance, (c) acceptance of MAX, (d) intervention completion rate, (e) cognitive and behavioral outcomes, and (f) human effort and responsiveness of health care professionals in primary and secondary care settings. METHODS: MAX was designed to increase cognitive skills (ie, knowledge about asthma) and behavioral skills (ie, inhalation technique) in 10-15-year-olds with asthma, and enables support by a health professional and a family member. To this end, three design goals guided the development: (1) to build a conversational agent-patient working alliance; (2) to offer hybrid (human- and conversational agent-supported) ubiquitous coaching; and (3) to provide an intervention with high experiential value. An interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, asthma experts, and young patients with their parents developed the intervention collaboratively. The conversational agent communicates with health care professionals via email, with patients via a mobile chat app, and with a family member via SMS text messaging. A single-arm feasibility study in primary and secondary care settings was performed to assess MAX. RESULTS: Results indicated an overall positive evaluation of MAX with respect to its reach (49.5%, 49/99 of recruited and eligible patient-family member teams participated), a strong patient-conversational agent working alliance, and high acceptance by all relevant stakeholders. Moreover, MAX led to improved cognitive and behavioral skills and an intervention completion rate of 75.5%. Family members supported the patients in 269 out of 275 (97.8%) coaching sessions. Most of the conversational turns (99.5%) were conducted between patients and the conversational agent as opposed to between patients and health care professionals, thus indicating the scalability of MAX. In addition, it took health care professionals less than 4 minutes to assess the inhalation technique and 3 days to deliver related feedback to the patients. Several suggestions for improvement were made. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that conversational agents, designed as mediating social actors involving health care professionals, patients, and family members, are not only accepted in such a ""team player"" role but also show potential to improve health-relevant outcomes in chronic disease management.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:47","2025-07-26 09:58:47","","e25060","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seeking to improve the effectiveness of gait training in this patient population, this study developed and assessed the feasibility of a real-time biofeedback mechanism to augment untethered ankle exoskeleton-assisted walking performance in individuals with CP. We selected step length as a clinically-relevant gait performance target and utilized a visual interface with live performance scores. An adaptive ankle exoskeleton control algorithm provided assistance proportional to the real-time ankle moment. We assessed lower-extremity gait mechanics and muscle activity in seven ambulatory individuals with CP as they walked with adaptive ankle assistance alone and with ankle assistance plus step-length biofeedback. We achieved our technical validation goal by demonstrating a strong correlation between estimated step length and real step length (R = 0.771, p < 0.001). We achieved our clinical feasibility goal by demonstrating that biofeedback-plus-assistance resulted in a 14% increase in step length relative to baseline (p ≤ 0.05), while no difference in step length was observed for assistance alone. Additionally, we observed near immediate improvements in lower-extremity posture, moments, and positive power relative to baseline for biofeedback-plus-assistance (p < 0.05), with none, or more-limited improvements observed for assistance alone. Our findings suggest that providing real-time biofeedback and using step length as the target can be effective for increasing the rate at which individuals with CP improve their gait mechanics when walking with wearable ankle assistance.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:47","2025-07-26 09:58:47","","442-449","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment implications include the need to address this problem. However, it is not always possible to train repeatedly in front of a real audience. The present study aimed to assess the relevance of using a virtual classroom in clinical practice with school-age children and adolescents who stutter. METHODS: Ten children and adolescents who stutter (aged 9-17 years old) had to speak in three different situations: in front of a real audience, in front of a virtual class and in an empty virtual apartment using a head-mounted display. We aimed to assess whether the self-rated levels of anxiety while speaking in front of a virtual audience reflect the levels of anxiety reported while speaking in front of a live audience, and if the stuttering level while speaking to a virtual class reflects the stuttering level while speaking in real conditions. RESULTS: Results show that the real audience creates higher anticipatory anxiety than the virtual class. However, both the self-reported anxiety levels and the stuttering severity ratings when talking in front of a virtual class did not differ from those observed when talking to a real audience, and were significantly higher than when talking in an empty virtual apartment. CONCLUSION: Our results support the feasibility and relevance of using a virtual classroom to expose school-age children and adolescents who stutter to a feared situation during cognitive behavioral therapy targeting the fear of public speaking.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:47","2025-07-26 09:58:47","","105830","","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do so, we have used a systematic literature review, which is considered an adequate method to study the state of the art of a given topic. In light of the above, we performed 1) a quantitative assessment of 50 articles by using bibliometric tools and 2) a qualitative analysis of the literature to identify meaningful relationships between articles. As a result, the literature evidenced a trinomial relationship between Universities, Society and Industries, which are interestingly far more exploited than the Education and Research. Given the noticeable importance of producing knowledge and dissemination of that information, we believe Universities will continue to have a prominent centrality in society in that regard; however, current data leads us to believe that the Universities success of producing knowledge highly depends on the efficiency of each countries to establish effective political actions.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:48","2025-07-26 09:58:48","","23-33","","","181","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beyond its tangible artefacts to address societal and structural needs, social innovation can best be understood as innovation in social relations, in power dynamics and in governance transformations, and may include institutional and systems transformations.MethodsA scoping review was conducted of empirical studies published in the past 10 years, to identify how social innovation in healthcare has been applied, the enablers and barriers affecting its operation, and gaps in the current literature. A number of disciplinary databases were searched between April and June 2020, including Academic Source Complete, CIHAHL, Business Source Complete Psych INFO, PubMed and Global Health. A 10-year publication time frame was selected and articles limited to English text. Studies for final inclusion was based on a pre-defined criteria.ResultsOf the 27 studies included in this review, the majority adopted a case research methodology. Half of these were from authors outside the health sector working in high-income countries (HIC). Social innovation was seen to provide creative solutions to address barriers associated with access and cost of care in both low- and middle-income countries and HIC settings in a variety of disease focus areas. Compared to studies in other disciplines, health researchers applied social innovation mainly from an instrumental and technocratic standpoint to foster greater patient and beneficiary participation in health programmes. No empirical evidence was presented on whether this process leads to empowerment, and social innovation was not presented as transformative. The studies provided practical insights on how implementing social innovation in health systems and practice can be enhanced.ConclusionsBased on theoretical literature, social innovation has the potential to mobilise institutional and systems change, yet research in health has not yet fully explored this dimension. Thus far, social innovation has been applied to extend population and financial coverage, principles inherent in universal health coverage and central to SDG 3.8. However, limitations exist in conceptualising social innovation and applying its theoretical and multidisciplinary underpinnings in health research.Graphic abstract","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:48","2025-07-26 09:58:48","","26","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A well-designed HIT tool can deliver behavior change recommendations and provide community resources to address this gap, and the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model can guide its development and refinement. This article reports the application of the ORBIT model to (1) describe the characteristics and design of a novel HIT tool (the PREVENT tool) using behavioral theory, (2) illustrate the use of stakeholder-centered ""designing for dissemination and sustainability"" principles, and (3) discuss the practical implications and directions for future research. Two types of stakeholder engagement (customer discovery and user testing) were conducted with end users (outpatient healthcare teams). Customer discovery interviews (<i>n</i> = 20) informed PREVENT tool components and intervention targets by identifying (1) what healthcare teams (e.g., physicians, dietitians) identified as their most important ""jobs to be done"" in helping adolescents who are overweight/obese adopt healthy behaviors, (2) their most critical ""pains"" and ""gains"" related to overweight/obesity treatment, and (3) how they define success compared to competing alternatives. Interviews revealed the need for a tool to help healthcare teams efficiently deliver tailored, evidence-based behavior change recommendations, motivate patients, and follow-up with patients within the constraints of clinic schedules and workflows. The PREVENT tool was developed to meet these needs. It facilitates prevention discussions, delivers tailored, evidence-based recommendations for physical activity and food intake, includes an interactive map of community resources to support behavior change, and automates patient follow-up. Based on Self-Determination Theory, the PREVENT tool engages the patient to encourage competence and autonomy to motivate behavior change. The use of this intentional, user-centered design process should increase the likelihood of the intended outcomes (e.g., behavior change, weight stabilization/loss) and ultimately increase uptake, implementation success, and long-term results. After initial tool development, user-testing interviews (<i>n</i> = 13) were conducted using a think-aloud protocol that provided insight into users' (i.e., healthcare teams) cognitive processes, attitudes, and challenges when using the tool. Overall, the PREVENT tool was perceived to be useful, well-organized, and visually appealing.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:49","2025-07-26 09:58:49","","648777","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We performed this study according to the Cochrane and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO in July 2020. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of mHealth interventions targeting PA as a primary outcome in adults. Eligible outcome measures were walking, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total physical activity (TPA), and energy expenditure. Where reported, we extracted data for 3 time points (ie, end of intervention, follow-up ≤6 months, and follow-up >6 months). To explore effect moderators, we performed subgroup analyses by population, intervention design, and control group type. Results were summarized using random effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. RESULTS: Of the 2828 identified studies, 117 were included. These studies reported on 21,118 participants with a mean age of 52.03 (SD 14.14) years, of whom 58.99% (n=12,459) were female. mHealth interventions significantly increased PA across all the 4 outcome measures at the end of intervention (walking standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.55; P<.001; MVPA SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.21-0.35; P<.001; TPA SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.47; P<.001; energy expenditure SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.13-0.75; P=.01). Only 33 studies reported short-term follow-up measurements, and 8 studies reported long-term follow-up measurements in addition to end-of-intervention results. In the short term, effects were sustained for walking (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.42; P=.002), MVPA (SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.35; P=.008), and TPA (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.13-0.93; P=.009). In the long term, effects were also sustained for walking (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.39; P=.001) and MVPA (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.27; P<.001). We found the study population to be an effect moderator, with higher effect scores in sick and at-risk populations. PA was increased both in scalable and nonscalable mHealth intervention designs and regardless of the control group type. The risk of bias was rated high in 80.3% (94/117) of the studies. Heterogeneity was significant, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth interventions can foster small to moderate increases in PA. The effects are maintained long term; however, the effect size decreases over time. The results encourage using mHealth interventions in at-risk and sick populations and support the use of scalable mHealth intervention designs to affordably reach large populations. However, given the low evidence quality, further methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:50","2025-07-26 09:58:50","","e26699","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using an online survey, 1180 complete responses were collected and analyzed using the statistical confirmatory factor analysis method. The use of SN in the Middle Eastern HE sector has the capacity to promote and motivate students to acquire professional and personal skills for their studies and future workplace; however, the use of SN by tertiary students is also associated with several risks: isolation, depression, privacy, and security. Furthermore, culture is influenced by using SN use, since some countries shifted from one dimension to another based on Hofstede's cultural framework. The study new findings are based on a sample at a specific point in time within a culture. The study findings encourage academics to include SN in unit activities and assessments to reap the benefits of SN, while taking steps to mitigate any risks that SN poses to students. Although other studies in the Middle East examined the use of Learning Management System and Facebook in, HE as a means of engaging students in discussions and communications, however, this study contributes a better understanding of the benefits and risks, awareness, culture, and sustainability, associated with the use of SN in the HE sector in the Middle East.

However, long-term adherence to CAs is still a challenge and needs to be explored. Personalization of CAs has the potential to improve long-term adherence and, with it, user satisfaction, task efficiency, perceived benefits, and intended behavior change. Research on personalized CAs has already addressed different aspects, such as personalized recommendations and anthropomorphic cues. However, detailed information on interaction styles between patients and CAs in the role of medical health care professionals is scant. Such interaction styles play essential roles for patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and outcome, as has been shown for physician-patient interactions. Currently, it is not clear (1) whether chronically ill patients prefer a CA with a paternalistic, informative, interpretive, or deliberative interaction style, and (2) which factors influence these preferences. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the preferences of chronically ill patients for CA-delivered interaction styles. METHODS: We conducted two studies. The first study included a paper-based approach and explored the preferences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for paternalistic, informative, interpretive, and deliberative CA-delivered interaction styles. Based on these results, a second study assessed the effects of the paternalistic and deliberative interaction styles on the relationship quality between the CA and patients via hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses in an online experiment with COPD patients. Patients' sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics served as moderator variables. RESULTS: Study 1 with 117 COPD patients revealed a preference for the deliberative (50/117) and informative (34/117) interaction styles across demographic characteristics. All patients who preferred the paternalistic style over the other interaction styles had more severe COPD (three patients, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease class 3 or 4). In Study 2 with 123 newly recruited COPD patients, younger participants and participants with a less recent COPD diagnosis scored higher on interaction-related outcomes when interacting with a CA that delivered the deliberative interaction style (interaction between age and CA type: relationship quality: b=-0.77, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.18; intention to continue interaction: b=-0.49, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.01; working alliance attachment bond: b=-0.65, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.04; working alliance goal agreement: b=-0.59, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.01; interaction between recency of COPD diagnosis and CA type: working alliance goal agreement: b=0.57, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that age and a patient's personal disease experience inform which CA interaction style the patient should be paired with to achieve increased interaction-related outcomes with the CA. These results allow the design of personalized health care CAs with the goal to increase long-term adherence to health-promoting behavior.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:50","2025-07-26 09:58:50","","e26643","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subject is extremely visual and has, therefore, previously been a target for the development of technology-enhanced learning initiatives over the last ten years. Today's students have come to expect the integration of technology in the classroom and remotely. They adjust quickly to the innovative use of new applications and software and have begun to integrate it within their own workflow for note taking and study aids. Given the intense drive toward blended deliveries of anatomy as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is easy to picture how the benefits of working in partnership with students (in order to achieve many of these aims) would be possible, particularly in difficult subjects like neuroanatomy. In doing so, it provides anatomists with new opportunities to engage students in a way that aligns well with best practice frameworks for engaging students through partnership. The current United Kingdom guidelines set out by Advance HE (a professional membership organization for promoting excellence in higher education) strongly encourages the higher education community to seek out appropriate academic contexts where a balance of power can be struck between staff and student to create a community of practice. If such an approach can be fully embraced by anatomists, a strong argument can be made for seizing the opportunity to optimize the benefits of student partnership work in this discipline.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:51","2025-07-26 09:58:51","","417-425","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stage‐gate systems (SGS) and agile methodology (AM) are the dominant approaches. Recently, hybrid approaches (combining SGS and AM) have been proposed. Although these hybrid approaches represent a significant development in NPD, combining them without considering their design principles might lead to contradictory and competing conceptual formulations, thus increasing the difficulty of comparison among studies. Moreover, scholars and practitioners may struggle to understand when, why and how a certain configuration of the NPD process provides the right response to different manifestations of uncertainty. The current literature faces problems regarding the clarity of design principles (e.g. flexibility and adaptability), and this has led to research gaps concerning the uncertainty contingency and outcomes of hybrid approaches. This study combines bibliometric and content analyses to identify four design parameters and principles of NPD hybrid approaches: flexibility, adaptability, velocity and integration.

An online survey was applied to compare students' perceptions based on their reading of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube. A total of 143 valid responses of students in business and engineering careers in Chile were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test, showing a difference in the perceptions of undergraduates who read social media content once a day or more. The results show that a higher frequency of reading such content is related to higher perceived relevance of environmental sustainability, social welfare, and fair trade; likewise, it is linked with less perceived importance of sustainability as a driver of entrepreneurship. This evidence is relevant in recognizing the potential of social media sites to strengthen the higher education in sustainable entrepreneurship because these channels can be incorporated as a formal source of information for learning and its use is still limited. Future research should explore what specific types of content have the most significant impact on perceptions of sustainable entrepreneurship and promote particular methods for their application in this area.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:53","2025-07-26 09:58:53","","e07272","","6","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The organizational challenge for entrepreneurial universities is the selection of the appropriate formal organizational architecture to support the stages of entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to examine the organizational architecture of entrepreneurial universities and how it supports the stages of entrepreneurship — latent, emergent, launch, and growth. Our conceptual organizational framework conflates the stages of entrepreneurship with the actual needs of university-based entrepreneurs and how these needs are supported through different formal organizational units within the organizational architecture of entrepreneurial universities. Therein, we categorize three types of formal organizational units — those that focus on exploration stages of entrepreneurship, those that straddle exploration and exploitation stages of entrepreneurship, and those that boundary span all stages of entrepreneurship.

In support of this, mounting evidence point to inter-relationships between entrepreneurial intention, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Prior research operationalized entrepreneurial careers as an escape from poor work environments; thus, there is a lack of understanding regarding how job-satisfaction can trigger entrepreneurship within and related to the environment of universities. This study, draws on Social Cognitive Career Theory and the concept of entrepreneurial intention, to address whether the role of job satisfaction is a moderating factor between outcome expectations and entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, we examine to what extent (I) entrepreneurial intention and (II) spin-off intention are determined by certain outcome expectations and perceived behavioral control. To address these questions this study examined academic researchers in specialized and non-technical fields and builds on a survey of 593 academic researchers at Swiss Universities of Applied Science. The results showed that outcome expectations are a significant predictor for entrepreneurial intentions, in general, and spin-off intentions, in particular. A multi-group analysis corroborated that job satisfaction operates as a motivational factor in entrepreneurial transition and interactions with entrepreneurial outcome expectations. In conclusion, the concept of job satisfaction and Social Cognitive Career Theory were powerful constructs to better the understand the process of entrepreneurial career decisions by academic researchers.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:54","2025-07-26 09:58:54","","1357-1386","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This contribution is possible through the multiactor value co-creation in the place. The aim of the article is to analyse the links between processes of co-creation of agricultural and gastronomic value through the integration of systems of production and gastronomy. Evidence is provided that food and agriculture are moving towards a holistic service logic integrating sector subsystems into broader inter-industrial ecosystems. The paradigm of Service-Dominant Logic offers a framework for analysing interactions between multiactor engagement processes, and food/gastronomy service linked to places and their cultural milieux. These complex processes of co-creation are mapped, then applied to the case of agriculture and gastronomy in the Basque Country in Spain. The Basque gastronomic co-creation brings together the rural context of smallholders, fishermen, or farmers, service providers, and the urban context of cities, with their circles of social interaction and events, where service users are largely concentrated. Crucial role in the system—as institutional innovators—is played by the Basque chefs who integrate the different aspects of food production and consumption.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:54","2025-07-26 09:58:54","","155-166","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent innovations in information and communication technology may offer new opportunities in suicide prevention in individuals, hereby potentially reducing this number. In our project, we design digital indices based on both self-reports and passive mobile sensing and test their ability to predict suicidal ideation, a major predictor for suicide, and psychiatric hospital readmission in high-risk individuals: psychiatric patients after discharge who were admitted in the context of suicidal ideation or a suicidal attempt, or expressed suicidal ideations during their intake. Specifically, two smartphone applications -one for self-reports (SIMON-SELF) and one for passive mobile sensing (SIMON-SENSE)- are installed on participants' smartphones. SIMON-SELF uses a text-based chatbot, called Simon, to guide participants along the study protocol and to ask participants questions about suicidal ideation and relevant other psychological variables five times a day. These self-report data are collected for four consecutive weeks after study participants are discharged from the hospital. SIMON-SENSE collects behavioral variables -such as physical activity, location, and social connectedness- parallel to the first application. We aim to include 100 patients over 12 months to test whether (1) implementation of the digital protocol in such a high-risk population is feasible, and (2) if suicidal ideation and psychiatric hospital readmission can be predicted using a combination of psychological indices and passive sensor information. To this end, a predictive algorithm for suicidal ideation and psychiatric hospital readmission using various learning algorithms (e.g., random forest and support vector machines) and multilevel models will be constructed. Data collected on the basis of psychological theory and digital phenotyping may, in the future and based on our results, help reach vulnerable individuals early and provide links to just-in-time and cost-effective interventions or establish prompt mental health service contact. The current effort may thus lead to saving lives and significantly reduce economic impact by decreasing inpatient treatment and days lost to inability.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:54","2025-07-26 09:58:54","","554811","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show strong empirical support for the entrepreneurship intention model proposed while highlighting some critical issues specific to entrepreneurial intention in scientists. In particular, we found an indirect effect of perceived subjective social support on entrepreneurial intention, which is mediated by entrepreneurial attitude and perceived behavioral control toward entrepreneurship. These results suggest that policies orientated toward promoting academic entrepreneurship should include developing a healthy social environment toward it, meaning that entrepreneurial intention is not only an individual but an organizational challenge.

Stress often hinders positive health outcomes in youth with obesity. Digital health interventions, with fewer on-site visits, promise health care access in remote regions; however, evidence for their effectiveness is scarce.MethodsThis randomized controlled not blinded trial (1:1) was conducted in a childhood obesity center in Switzerland. Forty-one youth aged 10–18 years with body mass index (BMI) > P.90 with risk factors or co-morbidities or BMI > P.97 were recruited. During 5.5 months, the PathMate2 group (PM) received daily conversational agent counselling via mobile app, combined with standardized counselling (4 on-site visits). Controls (CON) participated in a BCI (7 on-site visits). We compared the outcomes of both groups after 5.5 (T1) and 12 (T2) months. Primary outcome was reduction in BMI-SDS (BMI standard deviation score: BMI adjusted for age and sex). Secondary outcomes were changes in body fat and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis), waist-to-height ratio, physical capacities (modified Dordel-Koch-Test), blood pressure and pulse. Additionally, we hypothesized that less stressed children would lose more weight. Thus, children performed biofeedback relaxation exercises while stress parameters (plasma cortisol, stress questionnaires) were evaluated.ResultsAt intervention start median BMI-SDS of all patients (18 PM, 13 CON) was 2.61 (obesity > + 2SD). BMI-SDS decreased significantly in CON at T1, but not at T2, and did not decrease in PM during the study. Muscle mass, strength and agility improved significantly in both groups at T2; only PM reduced significantly their body fat at T1 and T2. Average daily PM app usage rate was 71.5%. Cortisol serum levels decreased significantly after biofeedback but with no association between stress parameters and BMI-SDS. No side effects were observed.ConclusionsEqually to BCI, PathMate2 intervention resulted in significant and lasting improvements of physical capacities and body composition, but not in sustained BMI-SDS decrease. This youth-appealing mobile health intervention provides an interesting approach for youth with obesity who have limited access to health care. Biofeedback reduces acute stress and could be an innovative adjunct to usual care.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:54","2025-07-26 09:58:54","","308","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approaches to condition monitoring of various rail transport systems-especially in the context of rail vehicle subsystem and track subsystem monitoring-have been evolving, and have become equally significant and challenging. The evolution of the approaches applied to rail systems' condition monitoring has followed manual maintenance, through methods connected to the application of sensors, up to the currently discussed methods and techniques focused on the mutual use of automation, data processing, and exchange. The aim of this paper is to provide an essential overview of the academic research on the condition monitoring of rail transport systems. This paper reviews existing literature in order to present an up-to-date, content-based analysis based on a coupled methodology consisting of bibliometric performance analysis and systematic literature review. This combination of literature review approaches allows the authors to focus on the identification of the most influential contributors to the advances in research in the analyzed area of interest, and the most influential and prominent researchers, journals, and papers.

Similar cancer care reforms were introduced in the period 2007-2015 to address the crisis. In this article we explore processes triggering these reforms in countries with similar and well-developed health care systems. The common objective was the need to reduce time from referral to start treatment, and the tool introduced to accomplish this was integrated care pathways for cancer diagnosis, that is Cancer Patient Pathways. This study investigates the process by drawing on interviews with key actors and public documents. We identified three main logics in play; the economic-administrative, the medical and the patient-related logic and explored how institutional entrepreneurs skillfully aligned these logics.

Based on the previous literature studies, four higher-order constructs are identified, namely cognitive, functional, social/personal and meta-competence. Investigating which ECs are categorised according to the four higher-order constructs in this relationship with EI is important as it contributes to the development and training of these antecedents of entrepreneurial behaviour. Data are collected from 203 nascent entrepreneurs in South Africa and analysed by using structural equation modelling. In this developing country context, only two higher-order constructs, cognitive/functional competence and social/personal competence, fit the data in relationship with EI. The strongest positive relationships were found between the cognitive and functional higher-order construct, opportunity recognition and opportunity assessment, conveying a compelling vision and creative problem-solving. The cognitive and functional higher-order competence construct also showed a strong positive relationship with EI. To improve pedagogical interventions and enhance EI, educators and policymakers can use these findings in entrepreneurship programmes to ensure that this higher-order competence construct with the individual ECs in this category are developed simultaneously rather than individually. Research efforts and support programmes that include cognitive and functional higher-order competence constructs for nascent entrepreneurs should therefore not be neglected. Such efforts and programmes can encourage EI, which in turn can enhance entrepreneurial behaviour, thereby potentially contributes to economic growth and employment creation.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:55","2025-07-26 09:58:55","","516120","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Creativity is the origin of innovation. Public sector creativity, however, is theoretically undefined and underexamined, resulting in unclarity on what constitutes public sector creativity. We define public sector creativity as “public servants coming up with novel and useful ideas through various practices.” Our findings indicate that public servants apply at least six taxonomically distinctive creative practices, and although they are involved to different extent in generating the initial idea and thus do not always generate ideas autonomously, they are creative in finding alternative ways to come up with ideas. However, our review indicates hiatuses in knowledge on public sector creativity, for which we provide a future research agenda.

In practice, however, there is little long-term engagement with breathing training, as shown by the usage statistics of breathing training apps. New research suggests that gameful smartphone-delivered breathing training may address this challenge. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the impact of breathing training, guided by a gameful visualization, on perceived experiential and instrumental values and the intention to engage in such training. METHODS: A between-subject online experiment with 170 participants was conducted, and one-way multiple analysis of variance and two-tailed t test analyses were used to test for any difference in intrinsic experiential value, perceived effectiveness, and the intention to engage in either a breathing training with a gameful or a nongameful guidance visualization. Moreover, prior experience in gaming and meditation practices were assessed as moderator variables for a preliminary analysis. RESULTS: The intrinsic experiential value for the gameful visualization was found to be significantly higher compared to the nongameful visualization (P=.001), but there was no difference in either perceived effectiveness (P=.50) or the intention to engage (P=.44). The preliminary analysis of the influence of meditation and gaming experience on the outcomes indicates that people with more meditation experience yielded higher intrinsic experiential values from using the gameful visualization than people with no or little meditation experience (P=.03). This analysis did not find any additional evidence of gaming time or meditation experience impacting the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The gameful visualization was found to increase the intrinsic experiential value of the breathing training without decreasing the perceived effectiveness. However, there were no differences in intentions to engage in both breathing training conditions. Furthermore, gaming and meditation experiences seem to have no or only a small positive moderating effect on the relationship between the gameful visualization and the intrinsic experiential value. Future longitudinal field studies are required to assess the impact of gameful breathing training on actual behavior, that is, long-term engagement and outcomes.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:55","2025-07-26 09:58:55","","e22803","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The implementation of a similar reform in three countries with a similar health care system created a unique opportunity to look for shared characteristics. Combining analytical framework of institutional theory and research on policy implementation, we identified common patterns of structuring of the initial implementation: The hierarchical processes were combined with supplementary structures located both within and outside the formal management hierarchy. Some had a permanent character while others were more project-like or even resembled social movements. These hybrid structures made it possible for actors from high up in the hierarchy to communicate directly to actors at the operational hospital level. Across the cases, we also identified structural components acting together with the traditional command-control; negotiation, consensus and counseling. However, variations in the presence of these did not seem to have significant impact on processes causing decisions and acceptance.

Health professional-delivered healthy lifestyle interventions have been shown to prevent type 2 diabetes. However, ongoing personalized guidance from health professionals is not feasible or affordable at the population level. Novel digital interventions delivered using mobile technology, such as conversational agents, are a potential alternative for the delivery of healthy lifestyle change behavioral interventions to the public. OBJECTIVE: We explored perceptions and experiences of Singaporeans on healthy living, diabetes, and mobile health (mHealth) interventions (apps and conversational agents). This study was conducted to help inform the design and development of a conversational agent focusing on healthy lifestyle changes. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in August and September 2019. A total of 20 participants were recruited from relevant healthy living Facebook pages and groups. Semistructured interviews were conducted in person or over the telephone using an interview guide. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed in parallel by 2 researchers using Burnard's method, a structured approach for thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The collected data were organized into 4 main themes: use of conversational agents, ubiquity of smartphone apps, understanding of diabetes, and barriers and facilitators to a healthy living in Singapore. Most participants used health-related mobile apps as well as conversational agents unrelated to health care. They provided diverse suggestions for future conversational agent-delivered interventions. Participants also highlighted several knowledge gaps in relation to diabetes and healthy living. Regarding barriers to healthy living, participants mentioned frequent dining out, high stress levels, lack of work-life balance, and lack of free time to engage in physical activity. In contrast, discipline, preplanning, and sticking to a routine were important for enabling a healthy lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this study commonly used mHealth interventions and provided important insights into their knowledge gaps and needs in relation to changes in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Future digital interventions such as conversational agents focusing on healthy lifestyle and diabetes prevention should aim to address the barriers highlighted in our study and motivate individuals to adopt healthy lifestyle behavior.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:56","2025-07-26 09:58:56","","e30435","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But while there is a flourishing literature on institutions' formal rules, processes, and organizational forms, scholars lament a relative lack of attention to institutions' informal side; their cultures. It is important to study institutions' cultures because it is through culture that people relate to institutional norms and rules in taking climate action. This review uncovers what work has been done on institutional cultures and climate change, discerns common themes around which this scholarship coheres, and advances and argument for why institutional cultures matter. We employed a systematic literature review to assemble a set of 54 articles with a shared concern for how climate change and institutional cultures concurrently affect each other. The articles provided evidence of a nascent field, emerging over the past 5–10 years and fragmented across literatures. This field draws on diverse concepts of institutionalism for revealing quite different expressions of culture, and is mostly grounded in empirical studies. These disparate studies compellingly demonstrate, from different perspectives, that institutional cultures do indeed matter for implementing climate governance. Indeed, the articles converge in providing empirical evidence of eight key sites of interaction between climate change and institutional cultures: worldviews, values, logics, gender, risk acceptance, objects, power, and relationality. These eight sites are important foci for examining and effecting changes to institutions and their cultures; showing how institutional cultures shape responses to climate change, and how climate change shapes institutional cultures.

This has given us a unique opportunity to understand how the same cohort perform in contrasting situations. In this study we consider the issue of attainment gaps and find that the attainment gap closed in this cohort for black and minority ethnic students but that students from a lower socio-economic background may have been put at a disadvantage by the move to online teaching, learning and assessment.

Team entrepreneurship is considered to be advantageous in its capability of integrating more abundant resources and of sharing knowledge, information, and complementary skills among members of the entrepreneurial team, enabling entrepreneurial enterprises to successfully adapt to the highly uncertain entrepreneurial environment. In recent years, the relationship between the heterogeneity of the entrepreneurial team and its decision-making quality has attracted much attention in the management research field. However, the research results on such topic are quite inconsistent. Based on the information processing theory, the greater the market uncertainty the entrepreneurial team faces, the stronger information integration ability a team will be required to possess. This study investigates the mechanism and boundary conditions of the impact of expertise heterogeneity of the entrepreneurial team on entrepreneurial decision-making. It points out that team knowledge integration and team reflexivity have significant impacts on the relationship between entrepreneurial team expertise heterogeneity and entrepreneurial decision-making. This study adopts the multi-source design approach and collects data from 419 academic entrepreneurial teams in the University Science and Technology Park in Zhejiang Province. Hierarchical regression and bootstrapping methods are also employed for data analysis. The results show that team knowledge integration mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial team expertise heterogeneity and entrepreneurial decision-making, whereas team reflexivity moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial team expertise heterogeneity and team knowledge integration. In the final part, the practical implications for entrepreneurial team are discussed.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:56","2025-07-26 09:58:56","","732857","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transdisciplinary research (TDR) has been conceptualized as important for achieving sustainability goals such as the SDGs. In this paper we (i) analyze the contributions of the five TDR projects toward the achievements of the SDGs at the city level in Africa, and (ii) explore the interactions between the assessed SDGs across the five projects. The projects’ contributions towards the achievements of the SDGs were examined in three thematic areas: (i) contexts, (ii) processes and (iii) products. The five projects were funded under the Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa (LIRA) programme. The projects were being implemented in nine cities across five African countries Accra (Ghana), Kumasi (Ghana), Korhogo (Ivory Coast), Abuja Metro (Nigeria), Mbour (Senegal), Cape Town (South Africa), Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (South Africa), Grahamstown (South Africa) and Kampala (Uganda) and data were collected on each of the five projects in these cities. The contextual contributions include co-analysis and reflection on policy and institutional silos and social innovations amenable to contextual complexity. A shift in how actors perceived and conceptualized sustainability challenges and the role of the projects as transformative social agents constituted the two main process contributions. Tool development, virtual models and maps, and handbook are the product contributions by the projects.

Drawing from the literature on non–IP-based academic entrepreneurship and gender disparities in science, this study used the “pair-matched” technique to isolate 406 female and male academics in business schools (203 of each gender from a sample of 729 academics) who share common characteristics regarding academic position, subdisciplinary affiliation, and experience. The study confirms that a comparison of female and noncomparable male academics could lead to an unfair judgement of female academics’ performance. However, the results show that even compared to comparable men, women are less involved in remunerated consultations, generate a smaller proportion of their revenue from consultations and are less engaged in the creation of consultancy companies. In addition, the study allows us to quantify a leaky pipeline of both genders involved in informal academic entrepreneurship and to identify four paths, from progressive to nonprogressive. Most female academics follow a progressive entrepreneurial path but often struggle to move from nonremunerated to remunerated entrepreneurial engagements. The study concludes with implications for university administrators on knowledge transfer and gender inequality.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:56","2025-07-26 09:58:56","","121295","","","174","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conduct a comparative network analysis of social entrepreneurship’s conceptual structure at academic and non-academic levels. This analysis has been performed considering scientific articles’ keywords and Wikipedia webpages’ co-occurrences, enabling us to identify four different thematic clusters in both cases.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine engagement with a mobile phone-based life skills program and its different components, as well as the associations of engagement with adolescent characteristics and intended substance use and mental health outcomes. METHODS: We performed secondary data analysis on data from the intervention group (n=750) from a study that compared a mobile phone-based life skills intervention for adolescents recruited in secondary and upper secondary school classes with an assessment-only control group. Throughout the 6-month intervention, participants received 1 SMS text message prompt per week that introduced a life skills topic or encouraged participation in a quiz or individual life skills training or stimulated sharing messages with other program participants through a friendly contest. Decision trees were used to identify predictors of engagement (use and subjective experience). The stability of these decision trees was assessed using a resampling method and by graphical representation. Finally, associations between engagement and intended substance use and mental health outcomes were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The adolescents took part in half of the 50 interactions (mean 23.6, SD 15.9) prompted by the program, with SMS text messages being the most used and contests being the least used components. Adolescents who did not drink in a problematic manner and attended an upper secondary school were the ones to use the program the most. Regarding associations between engagement and intended outcomes, adolescents who used the contests more frequently were more likely to be nonsmokers at follow-up than those who did not (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.98; P=.02). In addition, adolescents who read the SMS text messages more attentively were less likely to drink in a problematic manner at follow-up (odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 1.29-3.41; P=.003). Finally, participants who used the program the most and least were more likely to increase their well-being from baseline to 6-month follow-up compared with those with average engagement (βs=.39; t<sub>586</sub>=2.66; P=.008; R<sup>2</sup>=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the adolescents participating in a digital life skills program that aimed to prevent substance use and promote mental health engaged with the intervention. However, measures to increase engagement in problem drinkers should be considered. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure that interventions are engaging and powerful across different educational levels. First results indicate that higher engagement with digital life skills programs could be associated with intended outcomes. Future studies should apply further measures to improve the reach of lower-engaged participants at follow-up to establish such associations with certainty.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:56","2025-07-26 09:58:56","","e28638","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are best controlled through self-management practices, such as self-information. Fostering patients' access to health-related information through efficient and accessible channels, such as commercial voice assistants (VAs), may support the patients' ability to make health-related decisions and manage their chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the reliability of the most common VAs (ie, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant) in responding to questions about management of the main NCD. METHODS: We generated health-related questions based on frequently asked questions from health organization, government, medical nonprofit, and other recognized health-related websites about conditions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), lung cancer (LCA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). We then validated them with practicing medical specialists, selecting the 10 most frequent ones. Given the low average frequency of the AD-related questions, we excluded such questions. This resulted in a pool of 60 questions. We submitted the selected questions to VAs in a 3×3×6 fractional factorial design experiment with 3 developers (ie, Amazon, Apple, and Google), 3 modalities (ie, voice only, voice and display, display only), and 6 diseases. We assessed the rate of error-free voice responses and classified the web sources based on previous research (ie, expert, commercial, crowdsourced, or not stated). RESULTS: Google showed the highest total response rate, followed by Amazon and Apple. Moreover, although Amazon and Apple showed a comparable response rate in both voice-and-display and voice-only modalities, Google showed a slightly higher response rate in voice only. The same pattern was observed for the rate of expert sources. When considering the response and expert source rate across diseases, we observed that although Google remained comparable, with a slight advantage for LCA and CKD, both Amazon and Apple showed the highest response rate for LCA. However, both Google and Apple showed most often expert sources for CVA, while Amazon did so for DM. CONCLUSIONS: Google showed the highest response rate and the highest rate of expert sources, leading to the conclusion that Google Assistant would be the most reliable tool in responding to questions about NCD management. However, the rate of expert sources differed across diseases. We urge health organizations to collaborate with Google, Amazon, and Apple to allow their VAs to consistently provide reliable answers to health-related questions on NCD management across the different diseases.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:56","2025-07-26 09:58:56","","e32161","","12","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the specific relationships between human factors and prosthesis design and performance characteristics have not yet been adequately investigated. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap.MethodsA comprehensive single-cohort survey of 114 unilateral transfemoral amputees addressed a broad range of demographic and clinical characteristics, functional autonomy, satisfaction and attitudes towards their current prostheses, and design priorities for an ideal transfemoral prosthesis, including the possibility of active assistance from a robotic knee unit. The survey was custom-developed based on several standard questionnaires used to assess motor abilities and autonomy in activities of daily living, prosthesis satisfaction, and quality of life in lower-limb amputees. Survey data were analyzed to compare the experience (including autonomy and satisfaction) and design priorities of users of transfemoral prostheses with versus without microprocessor-controlled knee units (MPKs and NMPKs, respectively), with a subsequent analyses of cross-category correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), cost-sensitivity segmentation, and unsupervised K-means clustering applied within the most cost-sensitive participants, to identify functional groupings of users with respect to their design priorities.ResultsThe cohort featured predominantly younger (< 50 years) traumatic male amputees with respect to the general transfemoral amputee population, with pronounced differences in age distribution and amputation etiology (traumatic vs. non-traumatic) between MPK and NMPK groups. These differences were further reflected in user experience, with MPK users reporting significantly greater overall functional autonomy, satisfaction, and sense of prosthesis ownership than those with NMPKs, in conjunction with a decreased incidence of instability and falls. Across all participants, the leading functional priorities for an ideal transfemoral prosthesis were overall stability, adaptability to variable walking velocity, and lifestyle-related functionality, while the highest-prioritized general characteristics were reliability, comfort, and weight, with highly variable prioritization of cost according to reimbursement status. PCA and user clustering analyses revealed the possibility for functionally relevant groupings of prosthesis features and users, based on their differential prioritization of these features—with implications towards prosthesis design tradeoffs.ConclusionsThis study’s findings support the understanding that when appropriately prescribed according to patient characteristics and needs in the context of a proactive rehabilitation program, advanced transfemoral prostheses promote patient mobility, autonomy, and overall health. Survey data indicate overall stability, modularity, and versatility as key design priorities for the continued development of transfemoral prosthesis technology. Finally, observed associations between prosthesis type, user experience, and attitudes concerning prosthesis ownership suggest both that prosthesis characteristics influence device acceptance and functional outcomes, and that psychosocial factors should be specifically and proactively addressed during the rehabilitation process.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:56","2025-07-26 09:58:56","","168","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there remains a lack of clarity concerning best practice partnerships for innovation. This systematic literature review (SLR) provides insights onto the development of partnerships at the university–industry–government nexus and builds on the existing top-down/bottom-up approach for the creation of intermediaries of innovation. The SLR describes the evolution of these intermediaries, which is driven both by criteria set by partners and the globalization of the knowledge economy. This SLR reveals that the partnership structure most likely to further economic and broader societal goals is the living lab with the inherent focus on open innovation and co-creation. This SLR reveals that the living lab structure (and including sustainability labs and urban living labs) is the partnership structure utilized for innovation that addresses economic, social and environmental goals. Two areas are recommended for further research. One concerns the development of a deeper understanding of the relationship between the evolution in the structures of partnerships for innovation and how it is influenced by the globalization of the economy, society and environment, and changing modes of knowledge production. The other is to better understand why the living lab approach to partnership creation is best suited to the delivery of sustainable development objectives and how this learning can be applied to other models of partnership development at the university–industry–government nexus.","2021","2025-07-26 09:58:57","2025-07-26 09:58:57","","13780","","24","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High viral load may facilitate genital-anal HPV concurrence. Genital and anal HPV is reduced by a bivalent HPV16/18 vaccine, yet the effect on concurrent genital-anal HPV remains unclear. This study analyzed viral load in concurrent genital-anal HPV infections, relative to genital-only and anal-only HPV infections and the impact of vaccination in young women. We included 1074 women, who provided both genital and anal swabs. HPV detection and genotyping was performed using the SPF10-DEIA-LiPA25. HPV copy numbers were measured with type-specific qPCRs and corrected for cellular content to obtain the viral load. Concurrent genital-anal HPV often had significantly higher genital viral load (0.09-371 c/cell) than genital-only HPV (3.17E-04-15.9 c/cell, p < 0.0001 to p < 0.05). Moreover, nearly all concurrent genital-anal HPV types had higher genital copy numbers per PCR reaction (157-416E04 c/rxn) than anal copy numbers (0.90-884E01 c/rxn, p < 0.0001 to p < 0.001). Vaccinated women had significantly less infections with HPV16/18 vaccine-types (2.8% vs 13.7%, p < 0.0001) and HPV31/35/45 cross-protective types (7.4% vs 21.1%, p < 0.0001) than unvaccinated women.

We utilize factor analysis to downsize dozens of characteristics of these technology business incubators into seven factors related to the four proposed areas. Panel regression model results show that four of the seven factors related to three areas of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, namely people, technology, and capital areas, have statistically significant associations with an incubator's performance when applied to the overall national data set. Further, seven factors related to all four areas have various statistically significant associations with an incubator's performance in five major regional data set. In particular, a technology related factor has a consistently statistically significant association with the performance of the incubator in both national model and the five regional models, as we expected.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:57","2025-07-26 09:58:57","","e0261922","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study works with a sample of 399 people over 16 years of age and students of the Universidad Popular de Dos Hermanas in order to show the relationship between the Pygmalion effect and learned helplessness in the process of acquiring knowledge in adulthood. In this way, three tools were used: one questionnaire that showed the teachers' perceptions of the students' qualities and behaviour and two that provided information on self-concept, self-esteem, personal and social skills and other variables directly related to emotional intelligence and positive education. It shows how exposure to negative operational constraints hinders the psychosocial and socio-educational development of learners in all possible ways, while, on the other hand, it indicates the importance of positive education to compensate for this phenomenon by enhancing the development and growth of those who study and participate in non-formal education through positive reinforcement. Likewise, the factorial interrelation of both positive and negative conditioning factors and their incidence on learning is shown; the importance of neutralising the negative components and strengthening the positive reinforcement and the role played by the community and education professionals as catalysts and behavioural modulators at any stage of learning and age group for the achievement of the objectives of the student and of education itself in a broad sense.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:57","2025-07-26 09:58:57","","778","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, the management of institutional innovation remains an interest in research due to links of this form of innovation to economic growth, and the demands of on-going major socioeconomic transformations due to technological advances, increased occurrences of major crises, and emerging socioeconomic challenges. Accordingly, a key question arising from the literature concerns the range of determinants and priorities that influence institutional innovation for delivering society value. Thus, the onus is on scholarship to capture and advance knowledge for harnessing the potency of institutional innovation. The purpose of this article is to analyse the current state of research on institutional innovation. Using the systematic review methodology, we identify and critically appraise 485 peer-reviewed scientific publications between 1969 and 2021.

METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to all 50-years-olds (1992) in two Swedish counties (N = 8888) and repeated at the age of 65 (2007) and 75 years (2017). 3060 individuals responded on all three occasions (response rate 42.5%). Xerostomia was assessed with two questions. Additional questions addressed inter alia general/oral health and oral function. RESULTS: Reported prevalence of daytime xerostomia were 23.3% and 14.7%, and 39.5% and 27.5% in women and men, age 50 and 75, respectively. Night-time prevalence was higher. At age 50, 27.4% women and 24.0% men reported having dry mouth, and at age 75, 61.0% and 53.8%, respectively. At all time points, women reported significantly more xerostomia than men. Progression (deterioration) was common, and persistence (continuing presence) was high, while 25-year incidence for daytime xerostomia was 16.2% and 12.8%, and 33.6% and 29.8% at night-time, for women and men, respectively. Based on reports at age 50, regression analyses showed that prediction for developing xerostomia during the observation period, and reporting xerostomia at age 75 years, were female gender, impaired general health, chewing, jaw opening and intraoral problems, dissatisfaction with dental appearance, low education and having white/plastic filling. CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is common in older people, especially at night and in women. It can be predicted by diverse factors reported earlier in life. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Clinicians need to be made aware of that elderly often suffers from dry mouth so that they can recommend effective measures to eliminate or ease the patients accompanying symptoms and also exclude or lessen possible negative impact on oral health related to xerostomia.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:57","2025-07-26 09:58:57","","104056","","","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we surveyed a sample of 291 faculty from Kuwaiti colleges and universities. The core constructs were operationalized using scales validated in previous studies. The hypothesized relationships were tested using the structural equation modeling method. Our findings indicate that while female faculty are more proactive than men, males are innovative and risk-takers to some extent. Moreover, Ph.D. holders are more proactive and innovative than Master’s degree holders. The relationship between specialization and both innovativeness and risk-taking is significant only for business, but not for engineering. Teaching experience is more positively correlated with faculty proactivity. The number of scientific publications is negatively associated with faculty risk-taking propensity. Additionally, faculty who cumulated significant industry experience are proactive in identifying long-term opportunities and threats for their institutions. Having earned professional certifications is positively related to some aspects of innovativeness and proactivity. Finally, faculty who received their latest degree from a non-accredited institution are more active in realizing ideas at work.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:57","2025-07-26 09:58:57","","12","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have introduced the typology of symbiotic relationships and highlighted the significant role of keystone species in business ecosystems. We defined three symbiosis types based on the analysis results: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. The findings indicated that each relationship continuously transitions into different symbiotic relationships as the relationship between the participants changes.

In spite of the perceived weaknesses of people management in the higher education sector, in general, the current period of rapid and substantial contextual change may necessitate greater formalisation of HR practices across the British higher education sector. In addition to the changing role of the HR function and line managers, these developments may result in an increasingly stringent performance regime across the sector, especially in more hard-pressed institutions. Through a literature review and a pilot study, this paper attempts to address two main research questions: (i) what are the current performance management practices in the British Higher Education sector? and (ii) what needs to be done to strategically align these practices within HEIs in the UK? This paper discusses the wider literature related to performance management in general and to academic institutions in particular. We also undertook a small-scale qualitative study to explore the views of HR professionals on the need for, and the current performance measurement systems in their universities in the UK. The preliminary findings confirmed that PM is a key issue in the respondents' institutions, with substantial and recent changes in policy. This underscores the need for a large-scale research agenda to capture the current dynamics of change the sector is undergoing. The paper concludes by stimulating a policy debate and placing a number of research calls, along with suggestions on how these research questions may be investigated.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:57","2025-07-26 09:58:57","","4809-4824","","6","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Entrepreneurship represents a key factor in capturing new circular business opportunities. Research on circular entrepreneurship remains at an early phase and is correspondingly somewhat dispersed. Thus, the research objective here is to bring entrepreneurship into the focus of discussions on CE through a systematic literature review. In the absence of any systematic review on this theme, this work aims to map the relevant research and identify the themes discussed in the literature straddling entrepreneurship and the CE currently dispersed across the existing literature. Based on a sample of 102 articles collected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, this approach identified four thematic groups: growing circular SMEs, born circular firms and start‐ups, social entrepreneurship in CE, and support ecosystem for circular entrepreneurship. A greater emphasis on the study of growing circular SMEs to the detriment of other groups is observed. Also, research in the field is mainly focused on European countries. We then propose a future research agenda and a conceptual model for the entrepreneurial process in CE as a point of departure for further developing and deepening the literature on circular entrepreneurship.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:57","2025-07-26 09:58:57","","2256-2283","","5","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this paper was to conduct a knowledge synthesis of the published and grey literatures to develop a theoretical framework with the key features of EIP institutionalization.Methods We applied a critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) that allowed for a systematic, yet iterative and dynamic analysis of heterogeneous bodies of literature to develop an explanatory framework for EIP institutionalization. We used a “compass” question to create a detailed search strategy and conducted electronic searches to identify papers based on their potential relevance to EIP institutionalization. Papers were screened and extracted independently and in duplicate. A constant comparative method was applied to develop a framework on EIP institutionalization. The CIS was triangulated with the findings of stakeholder dialogues that involved civil servants, policy-makers and researchers.ResultsWe identified 3001 references, of which 88 papers met our eligibility criteria. This CIS resulted in a definition of EIP institutionalization as the “process and outcome of (re-)creating, maintaining and reinforcing norms, regulations, and standard practices that, based on collective meaning and values, actions as well as endowment of resources, allow evidence to become—over time—a legitimate and taken-for-granted part of health policy-making”. The resulting theoretical framework comprised six key domains of EIP institutionalization that capture both structure and agency: (1) governance; (2) standards and routinized processes; (3) partnership, collective action and support; (4) leadership and commitment; (5) resources; and (6) culture. Furthermore, EIP institutionalization is being achieved through five overlapping stages: (i) precipitating events; (ii) de-institutionalization; (iii) semi-institutionalization (comprising theorization and diffusion); (iv) (re)-institutionalization; and (v) renewed de-institutionalization processes.ConclusionsThis CIS advances the theoretical and conceptual discussions on EIP institutionalization, and provides new insights into an evidence-informed framework for initiating, strengthening and/or assessing efforts to institutionalize EIP.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:58","2025-07-26 09:58:58","","27","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research sample consisted of 600 respondents who declared to consume fruit and were responsible for food shopping in their households. The results obtained indicate that consumers with a higher propensity to purchase innovative products consumed fruit and fruit preserves more. In addition, statistically significant differences were found between innovators and non-innovators in terms of income, expenditures on fruit purchases, places where fruit and fruit preserves were purchased and product characteristics that determined the purchase decision. The logistic regression results indicate that a higher frequency of supermarket/hypermarket and online shopping, a higher weekly spending on fruit and a greater importance attributed to the biodegradability of the packaging increased the favorability of innovation relatively to fruit products (by 23.8%, 31.4%, 32.7% and 21.6%, respectively).

Therefore, it is particularly important to give attention to the individual psychological mechanism factors at play in the process of teachers in higher education academic entrepreneurship. The purpose of this study is to identify individual psychological capital and role conflict issues among university teachers in China. To accomplish this aim, we investigated the emergence of positive academic entrepreneurial intents, continued through the process of academic entrepreneurship, and clarified the impact of psychological capital and role conflict on entrepreneurial intent. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we constructed a research model from the perspective of entrepreneurial intent prior to entrepreneurial action.

However, adopting new technologies and practices is beyond the simple rational decision and the search for efficiency. There are contextual social and cultural systems that influence the behavior of people and organizations. Hence, institutional theory can yield interesting insights in the study of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this article is to examine how and to what extent institutional theory has been used to explain Industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of Industry 4.0 and the broader field of digitalization was performed using Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The authors analyzed the results using multivariate techniques (Descending Hierarchical Classification and Correspondence Factor Analysis) with the aid of the IRAMUTEQ software. Findings: Results indicate there is little research that uses an institutional perspective to investigate Industry 4.0. Most of them are quantitative and are based on the concept of institutional isomorphism. Qualitative studies, e.g., case studies and the use of theories such as institutional logics and institutional work could generate a richer comprehension of Industry 4.0. Besides, consideration of meso (e.g., organizational fields) and macro (e.g., countries) level of analysis should be more extensively explored. Originality/value: This paper identifies research gaps and points to relevant issues frequently not considered by researchers and practitioners. It reinforces a call for an institutional perspective where the concept of Industry 4.0 can be understood as a rationalized myth. Therefore, the meaning, practices, and consequences of Industry 4.0 implementation are expected to vary across organizations and countries.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:58","2025-07-26 09:58:58","","309-322","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the link between environmental governance and environmental management has received very little research attention. This paper adopts a mechanism-based framework to unpack the link between the governance and management of species at risk or endangered species in a working landscape. Using species at risk management in the South of the Divide region of southwestern Saskatchewan as a case study, we identified four governance conditions connected by five mechanisms to produce management outcomes. The governance conditions include facilitative leadership, local autonomy, trust, and incentives. The five mechanisms include institutional disruption, institutional crafting and drift, brokerage or bridging, program uptake, and alleviation of fear of harm. We discuss how using a mechanism-based approach could help us better understand the processes within the governance system that trigger particular management outcomes. For example, in this case study, dissatisfied factors disrupt the existing governance arrangements and create new ones that reflect their desire for local autonomy. Local autonomy, in turn, creates an atmosphere for local actors to form coalitions and build trust; trust enhances program uptake and the co-design and co-implementation of incentives, which then alleviates land managers' fear of harm from participating in species at risk management. Our study also suggests that top-down institutions that create room for further institutional work can become acceptable at the local level and enhance endangered species management. We conclude that a mechanism-based explanation can be useful for opening the black box connecting environmental governance and management and offering valuable recommendations to guide policy.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:58","2025-07-26 09:58:58","","2091-2106","","10","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there are plenty of studies on student entrepreneurs’ competences, most of these have been conducted in Western developed countries. Thus, their findings may not be generalisable to other cultural contexts, such as Asian emerging economies such as China. The present study fills this gap by investigating the CECs of Chinese college students using a mix of the Delphi method and case studies. Two research questions are addressed: How do key stakeholder groups in China understand the CECs of college students? And what are the discrepancies between conceptualised CECs and the actual practices of Chinese student entrepreneurs? The findings suggest that the CECs of college students extracted from Chinese experts’ opinions overlapped but were not completely consistent with the competence frameworks found in the literature. Such an inconsistency might be attributed to China’s distinct sociocultural context and developmental stage. These conceptualised competences were also at odds with the real-life practices of student entrepreneurs. Three conflicts were identified: (1) innovation vs. transformation of ideas, (2) winning entrepreneurial competitions vs. starting/running an actual business and (3) establishing vs. sustaining teams. The findings suggest that the understanding of CECs should be enriched and sharpened to help entrepreneurs address real-life challenges.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:58","2025-07-26 09:58:58","","781-801","","6","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Widespread concern about earth’s current trajectory and support for actions that would foster more sustainable pathways suggests potential social tipping points in public demand for an earth stewardship vision. Here, we draw on empirical studies and theory to show that movement toward a stewardship vision can be facilitated by changes in either policy incentives or social norms. Our novel contribution is to point out that both norms and incentives must change and can do so interactively. This can be facilitated through leverage points and complementarities across policy areas, based on values, system design, and agency. Potential catalysts include novel democratic institutions and engagement of non-governmental actors, such as businesses, civic leaders, and social movements as agents for redistribution of power.

However, despite the availability of evidence-based mHealth apps, a substantial proportion of users do not adhere to them as intended and may consequently not receive treatment. Therefore, understanding the factors that act as barriers to or facilitators of adherence is a fundamental concern in preventing intervention dropouts and increasing the effectiveness of digital health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to help stakeholders develop more effective digital health interventions by identifying factors influencing the continued use of mHealth apps targeting NCDs. We further derived quantified adherence scores for various health domains to validate the qualitative findings and explore adherence benchmarks. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search (January 2007 to December 2020) was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library. Data on intended use, actual use, and factors influencing adherence were extracted. Intervention-related and patient-related factors with a positive or negative influence on adherence are presented separately for the health domains of NCD self-management, mental health, substance use, nutrition, physical activity, weight loss, multicomponent lifestyle interventions, mindfulness, and other NCDs. Quantified adherence measures, calculated as the ratio between the estimated intended use and actual use, were derived for each study and compared with the qualitative findings. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 2862 potentially relevant articles, of which 99 (3.46%) were included as part of the inclusion criteria. A total of 4 intervention-related factors indicated positive effects on adherence across all health domains: personalization or tailoring of the content of mHealth apps to the individual needs of the user, reminders in the form of individualized push notifications, user-friendly and technically stable app design, and personal support complementary to the digital intervention. Social and gamification features were also identified as drivers of app adherence across several health domains. A wide variety of patient-related factors such as user characteristics or recruitment channels further affects adherence. The derived adherence scores of the included mHealth apps averaged 56.0% (SD 24.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the scarce scientific evidence on factors that positively or negatively influence adherence to mHealth apps and is the first to quantitatively compare adherence relative to the intended use of various health domains. As underlying studies mostly have a pilot character with short study durations, research on factors influencing adherence to mHealth apps is still limited. To facilitate future research on mHealth app adherence, researchers should clearly outline and justify the app's intended use; report objective data on actual use relative to the intended use; and, ideally, provide long-term use and retention data.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:58","2025-07-26 09:58:58","","e35371","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on the ""net effect"" of the factors affecting academic entrepreneurial intention has achieved some theoretical results. However, the results that affect academic entrepreneurial intention are complex and not influenced by a single factor, but rather by the interaction between various factors. Therefore, this study used a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis research method to explore how various factors can affect scholars' academic entrepreneurial intention from two dimensions: the Big Five personality traits and academic entrepreneurial motivation. Our findings showed two configurations that affect high academic entrepreneurial intention of university scholars: the openness to experience-ribbon-dominant path, and the ribbon-dominant path. Additionally, two configurations were revealed for the formation of not-high academic entrepreneurial intention: extraversion-conscientiousness-inhibition and extraversion-agreeableness-gold-hindrance paths. Moreover, this study revealed that a causal asymmetry exists between the high and the not-high academic entrepreneurial intention configurations. This study broadens the application of the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis method in the research of academic entrepreneurial intention and provides theoretical and practical insights for researchers and practitioners on how to effectively stimulate scholars' academic entrepreneurial intention.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:58","2025-07-26 09:58:58","","799770","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Educator development is thus the focus of many LMIC programs initiated by universities and governments of high income countries. While signs of medical educator professionalization such as postgraduate qualifications, specialized units, and professional associations have emerged in LMIC, whether these relate to programs originating from outside LMIC contexts is unknown. This study investigated the contextual influences on the long-term impact of an international faculty development program a decade after its delivery in a LMIC context - Vietnam. Ten years after an international aid program to develop clinical skills teaching expertise in Vietnam, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with eight medical educators from all eight participating medical schools. Selected for their leadership potential, each participant had completed the Maastricht Masters in Health Professions Education during the program. Interview transcripts underwent thematic analysis, using the Theory of Practice Architectures as a conceptual lens to highlight the contextual influences on professional practice. Four themes were identified: <i>Careers and Practices</i> before, during, and after the program, <i>Unrecognized and Unseen</i> practice, <i>Structural Restraints</i> on individual advancement and collective activity, and the <i>Cultivation of Connections</i> through social traditions. Participants reported being in well-established teaching delivery roles. However, the absence of professionalizing discourses and material resources meant that practice was restricted and determined by institutional leadership and individuals' adaptations. Informed by the theory of practice architectures, we found that change in medical education practice will falter in contexts that lack supporting discursive, material-economic, and socio-political arrangements. While there were emerging signs of individual agency, the momentum of change was not sustained and perhaps unapparent to Western framings of educational leadership. Practice architectures offers a framework for identifying the contextual features which influence practice, from which to design and deliver sustainable and impactful interventions, and to advance context-relevant evaluation and research. Our findings suggest that faculty development delivered across diverse contexts, such as in distributed or transnational medical programs, may have more effect if informed by a practice architectures analysis of each context.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:58","2025-07-26 09:58:58","","323-334","","3","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research shows that clients can develop an affective bond with chatbots. However, few research studies have investigated whether this perceived relationship is affected by the social roles of differing closeness a chatbot can impersonate and by allowing users to choose the social role of a chatbot. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at understanding how the social role of a chatbot can be expressed using a set of interpersonal closeness cues and examining how these social roles affect clients' experiences and the development of an affective bond with the chatbot, depending on clients' characteristics (ie, age and gender) and whether they can freely choose a chatbot's social role. METHODS: Informed by the social role theory and the social response theory, we developed a design codebook for chatbots with different social roles along an interpersonal closeness continuum. Based on this codebook, we manipulated a fictitious health care chatbot to impersonate one of four distinct social roles common in health care settings-institution, expert, peer, and dialogical self-and examined effects on perceived affective bond and usage intentions in a web-based lab study. The study included a total of 251 participants, whose mean age was 41.15 (SD 13.87) years; 57.0% (143/251) of the participants were female. Participants were either randomly assigned to one of the chatbot conditions (no choice: n=202, 80.5%) or could freely choose to interact with one of these chatbot personas (free choice: n=49, 19.5%). Separate multivariate analyses of variance were performed to analyze differences (1) between the chatbot personas within the no-choice group and (2) between the no-choice and the free-choice groups. RESULTS: While the main effect of the chatbot persona on affective bond and usage intentions was insignificant (P=.87), we found differences based on participants' demographic profiles: main effects for gender (P=.04, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.115) and age (P&lt;.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.192) and a significant interaction effect of persona and age (P=.01, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.102). Participants younger than 40 years reported higher scores for affective bond and usage intentions for the interpersonally more distant expert and institution chatbots; participants 40 years or older reported higher outcomes for the closer peer and dialogical-self chatbots. The option to freely choose a persona significantly benefited perceptions of the peer chatbot further (eg, free-choice group affective bond: mean 5.28, SD 0.89; no-choice group affective bond: mean 4.54, SD 1.10; P=.003, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.117). CONCLUSIONS: Manipulating a chatbot's social role is a possible avenue for health care chatbot designers to tailor clients' chatbot experiences using user-specific demographic factors and to improve clients' perceptions and behavioral intentions toward the chatbot. Our results also emphasize the benefits of letting clients freely choose between chatbots.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:59","2025-07-26 09:58:59","","e32630","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A useful combination of several bibliometric techniques gave us valuable references for re-focusing this area of science to adopt action-oriented research where a group of stakeholders collaborates and co-creates solutions. An analysis of valuable action-oriented CE studies reveals that scholars focus on the techno-economic aspect, where they develop ways to create optimal circular material and energy flows and co-design processes for products/services, as well as the organizational aspect, where they study self-sustainable community networks and participatory governance. We identify three research streams that would benefit from such action-oriented research for a faster practical implementation: sustainable supply chains, waste management, and business model innovation.

Thus, one of the main factors that allow achieving sustainability is Industry 4.0 (I4.0). In addition, the research aims to evaluate the role of I4.0 during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The literature review process defines ten future projections with potential for the CE's adoption. The two-round Delphi approach was developed with 54 CE experts to evaluate the projections. In both rounds, the probability of occurrence up to 2030, its impact on the CE and its desirability were evaluated. Likewise, the qualitative criteria of the experts were coded to evaluate the projections. From the ten projections, four are those with the highest probability of occurrence (EP > 70%), with high impact (I > 3.5) and desirability of occurrence (I > 3.5). Expert evaluations make it possible to identify that Industry 4.0 and the digital skills of workers, their financing, and the efficiency of Government policies have a high probability of occurrence in the adoption of the CE in 2030.

This concept article from the Digital Pathology Association (DPA) describes the rules of engagement for pathology innovators in academia and for their corporate partners to help establish best practices in this critical area. Stakeholders include pathologists, basic and translational researchers, university technology transfer and sponsored research offices, as well as industry relations officers. The article discusses the benefits and pitfalls of an AIP, reviews different partnership models, examines the role of pathologists in the innovation cycle, explains various agreements that may need to be signed, covers conflict of interest and intellectual property issues, and offers recommendations for ensuring successful partnerships.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:59","2025-07-26 09:58:59","","100026","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It involves a set of key principles and ground rules that are important for its design and implementation. However, despite its intuitive appeal, its implementation remains a challenge. The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the factors that affect the implementation process of programmatic assessment and how specific implementation challenges are managed across different programs. METHODS: An explanatory multiple case (collective) approach was used for this study. We identified 6 medical programs that had implemented programmatic assessment with variation regarding health profession disciplines, level of education and geographic location. We conducted interviews with a key faculty member from each of the programs and analyzed the data using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified two major factors in managing the challenges and complexity of the implementation process: knowledge brokers and a strategic opportunistic approach. Knowledge brokers were the people who drove and designed the implementation process acting by translating evidence into practice allowing for real-time management of the complex processes of implementation. These knowledge brokers used a 'strategic opportunistic' or agile approach to recognize new opportunities, secure leadership support, adapt to the context and take advantage of the unexpected. Engaging in an overall curriculum reform process was a critical factor for a successful implementation of programmatic assessment. DISCUSSION: The study contributes to the understanding of the intricacies of implementation processes of programmatic assessment across different institutions. Managing opportunities, adaptive planning, awareness of context, were all critical aspects of thinking strategically and opportunistically in the implementation of programmatic assessment. Future research is needed to provide a more in-depth understanding of values and beliefs that underpin the assessment culture of an organization, and how such values may affect implementation.","2022","2025-07-26 09:58:59","2025-07-26 09:58:59","","928-937","","8","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead, movements are often made up of distinct factions with unique agendas and tactics, and there is little scientific consensus on when these factions may complement-or impede-one another's influence. One central debate concerns whether radical flanks within a movement <i>increase</i> support for more moderate factions within the same movement by making the moderate faction seem more reasonable-or <i>reduce</i> support for moderate factions by making the entire movement seem unreasonable. Results of two online experiments conducted with diverse samples (<i>N</i> = 2,772), including a study of the animal rights movement and a preregistered study of the climate movement, show that the presence of a radical flank increases support for a moderate faction within the same movement. Further, it is the use of radical <i>tactics</i>, such as property destruction or violence, rather than a radical <i>agenda</i>, that drives this effect. Results indicate the effect owes to a contrast effect: Use of radical tactics by one flank led the more moderate faction to appear less radical, even though all characteristics of the moderate faction were held constant. This perception led participants to identify more with and, in turn, express greater support for the more moderate faction. These results suggest that activist groups that employ unpopular tactics can increase support for other groups within the same movement, pointing to a hidden way in which movement factions are complementary, despite pursuing divergent approaches to social change.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","pgac110","","3","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to gain strategic advantage from the employee brand equity it is important that organizations make efforts in retaining such employees that benefit the organizations. Therefore, this research examines the impact of employee brand equity and knowledge sharing culture on the enterprise performance with the mediating role of innovative capabilities. A self-administered survey was conducted among the 323 employees of information technology sector working in the software houses in China. Smart PLS has been used to analyze the data through partial least square structural equation modeling. Results of the study have demonstrated that knowledge sharing culture plays a significant role in the enterprise performance while employee brand equity could not find statistically significant impact on enterprise performance. In addition, the SEM analysis further showed that employee brand equity and knowledge sharing culture play a significant role in the innovative capabilities. Results also revealed that innovative capabilities mediate the effect of employee brand equity and knowledge sharing culture variables on the enterprise performance. This research enriches the literature by examining the role of knowledge sharing culture in enterprise performance and innovative capabilities. This research further offers certain implications for the human resource department in developing their human resources.

Several studies highlighted the importance of monitoring abdominal compliance (Cab) during the creation of laparoscopic workspace to individualize the insufflation pressure. The lack of validated clinical monitoring tools for abdominal compliance prevents accurate tailoring of insufflation pressure. Oscillometry, also known as the forced oscillation technique (FOT), is currently used to measure respiratory mechanics and has the potential to be adapted for monitoring abdominal compliance. This study aimed to define, develop and evaluate a novel approach which can monitor abdominal compliance during laparoscopy using endoscopic oscillometry.Materials and methodsEndoscopic oscillometry was evaluated in a porcine model for laparoscopy. A custom-built insufflator was developed for applying an oscillatory pressure signal superimposed onto a mean intra-abdominal pressure. This insufflator was used to measure the abdominal compliance at insufflation pressures ranging from 5 to 20 hPa (3.75 to 15 mmHg). The measurements were compared to the static abdominal compliance, which was measured simultaneously with computed tomography imaging.ResultsEndoscopic oscillometry recordings and CT images were obtained in 10 subjects, resulting in 76 measurement pairs for analysis. The measured dynamic Cab ranged between 0.0216 and 0.261 L/hPa while the static Cab based on the CT imaging ranged between 0.0318 and 0.364 L/hPa. The correlation showed a polynomial relation and the adjusted R-squared was 97.1%.ConclusionsEndoscopic oscillometry can be used to monitor changes in abdominal compliance during laparoscopic surgery, which was demonstrated in this study with a comparison with CT imaging in a porcine laparoscopy model. Use of this technology to personalize the insufflation pressure could reduce the risk of applying excessive pressure and limit the drawbacks of insufflation.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","7066-7074","","9","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, use statistics indicate that adherence to breathing training apps is low. Recent work suggests that gameful breathing training may help overcome this challenge. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to introduce and evaluate the gameful breathing training app Breeze 2 and its novel real-time breathing detection algorithm that enables the interactive components of the app. METHODS: We developed the breathing detection algorithm by using deep transfer learning to detect inhalation, exhalation, and nonbreathing sounds (including silence). An additional heuristic prolongs detected exhalations to stabilize the algorithm's predictions. We evaluated Breeze 2 with 30 participants (women: n=14, 47%; age: mean 29.77, SD 7.33 years). Participants performed breathing training with Breeze 2 in 2 sessions with and without headphones. They answered questions regarding user engagement (User Engagement Scale Short Form [UES-SF]), perceived effectiveness (PE), perceived relaxation effectiveness, and perceived breathing detection accuracy. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the UES-SF, PE, and perceived relaxation effectiveness scores with neutral scores. Furthermore, we correlated perceived breathing detection accuracy with actual multi-class balanced accuracy to determine whether participants could perceive the actual breathing detection performance. We also conducted a repeated-measure ANOVA to investigate breathing detection differences in balanced accuracy with and without the heuristic and when classifying data captured from headphones and smartphone microphones. The analysis controlled for potential between-subject effects of the participants' sex. RESULTS: Our results show scores that were significantly higher than neutral scores for the UES-SF (W=459; P&lt;.001), PE (W=465; P&lt;.001), and perceived relaxation effectiveness (W=358; P&lt;.001). Perceived breathing detection accuracy correlated significantly with the actual multi-class balanced accuracy (r=0.51; P&lt;.001). Furthermore, we found that the heuristic significantly improved the breathing detection balanced accuracy (F<sub>1,25</sub>=6.23; P=.02) and that detection performed better on data captured from smartphone microphones than than on data from headphones (F<sub>1,25</sub>=17.61; P&lt;.001). We did not observe any significant between-subject effects of sex. Breathing detection without the heuristic reached a multi-class balanced accuracy of 74% on the collected audio recordings. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants (28/30, 93%) perceived Breeze 2 as engaging and effective. Furthermore, breathing detection worked well for most participants, as indicated by the perceived detection accuracy and actual detection accuracy. In future work, we aim to use the collected breathing sounds to improve breathing detection with regard to its stability and performance. We also plan to use Breeze 2 as an intervention tool in various studies targeting the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","e39186","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our findings elucidated significant differences among the universities in their RDI efforts during the pandemic. Austrian universities exhibited higher levels of inter-institutional research and business collaborations, whereas the RDI efforts in the rest of the CEE sample universities were geared to solve more immediate needs the pandemic brought on. One of the main contributions of this study is the understanding of the RDI potential of the region and the relevance of establishing inter-institutional and business cooperation networks at national and international levels. The study shows that during the pandemic universities demonstrated high RDI potential to quickly react to critical needs, offered open innovations, open licensing, showed collaborative abilities and effective use of their academic and student resources.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","100238","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly crucial to community-based conservation interventions that strive to achieve both ecological and social objectives by actively engaging or devolving decision-making and management authority to local communities. Although a viable approach in many contexts, achieving ""unprecedented collaboration"" called for by the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework in community-based conservation is problematic given the multiple and diverse actors affecting and affected by these interventions. Therefore, effective leadership becomes crucial to implementing necessary strategies to engage actors and resolve conflict inclusively. Yet, weak leadership commonly constrains these interventions. I reviewed relevant literature and devised a framework of effective bridging leadership characteristics. I then used this framework to appraise bridging leadership in two African coastal-marine community-based conservation cases. I employed social network analysis and semistructured and group interviews in the two cases. Several local leaders emerged as key (potential) bridging leaders. Furthermore, I found that effective bridging leaders require not only legal recognition but also perceived legitimacy resulting from building trust with other actors. Additionally, the inclusive collaboration required multiple sources of emotionally intelligent bridging leaders with the integrity, humility, empathy, and cultural awareness necessary to mitigate elite capture, effectively communicate, and empower and provide support to others. Because emotional intelligence in conservation leadership remains a knowledge gap, particularly in community-based conservation research, insights from this study should be useful to diverse conservation actors.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","e13980","","6","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our estimates from the radial models show that countries could reduce their inputs by a mean value of 11.9 per cent and keep their level of innovations in the triple helix model and by a mean of 5.8 per cent on average in the extended quintuple helix model. We find higher total inefficiencies in the non-radial models, which amount to 25.3 per cent on average in the triple helix model and 21.8 per cent on average in the quintuple helix model. The breakdown of the inefficiency score for different inputs reveals that countries have the largest potential for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the least room to reduce the Education Index and Civil Society Participation.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","e10168","","8","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deposit contracts (in which participants pledge their own money) could be an affordable alternative. In addition, deposit contracts may have superior effects by exploiting the power of loss aversion. Previous research has often operationalized deposit contracts through loss framing a financial reward (without requiring a deposit) to mimic the feelings of loss involved in a deposit contract. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to disentangle the effects of incurring actual losses (through self-funding a deposit contract) and loss framing. We investigated whether incentive conditions are more effective than a no-incentive control condition, whether deposit contracts have a lower uptake than financial rewards, whether deposit contracts are more effective than financial rewards, and whether loss frames are more effective than gain frames. METHODS: Healthy participants (N=126) with an average age of 22.7 (SD 2.84) years participated in a 20-day physical activity intervention. They downloaded a smartphone app that provided them with a personalized physical activity goal and either required a €10 (at the time of writing: €1=US $0.98) deposit up front (which could be lost) or provided €10 as a reward, contingent on performance. Daily feedback on incentive earnings was provided and framed as either a loss or gain. We used a 2 (incentive type: deposit or reward) × 2 (feedback frame: gain or loss) between-subjects factorial design with a no-incentive control condition. Our primary outcome was the number of days participants achieved their goals. The uptake of the intervention was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Overall, financial incentive conditions (mean 13.10, SD 6.33 days goal achieved) had higher effectiveness than the control condition (mean 8.00, SD 5.65 days goal achieved; P=.002; ηp<sup>2</sup>=0.147). Deposit contracts had lower uptake (29/47, 62%) than rewards (50/50, 100%; P&lt;.001; Cramer V=0.492). Furthermore, 2-way analysis of covariance showed that deposit contracts (mean 14.88, SD 6.40 days goal achieved) were not significantly more effective than rewards (mean 12.13, SD 6.17 days goal achieved; P=.17). Unexpectedly, loss frames (mean 10.50, SD 6.22 days goal achieved) were significantly less effective than gain frames (mean 14.67, SD 5.95 days goal achieved; P=.007; ηp<sup>2</sup>=0.155). CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives help increase physical activity, but deposit contracts were not more effective than rewards. Although self-funded deposit contracts can be offered at low cost, low uptake is an important obstacle to large-scale implementation. Unexpectedly, loss framing was less effective than gain framing. Therefore, we urge further research on their boundary conditions before using loss-framed incentives in practice. Because of limited statistical power regarding some research questions, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution, and future work should be done to confirm these findings.

Specifically, we analyze nascent entrepreneurs in their process of start-up development while relying on metacognitive processes. The experiences of a sample of new venture initiatives are explored in two distinct phases, a start-up competition and the subsequent launch of their venture. Following the Gioia protocol, the study contextualizes the process in which social capital reinforces metacognitive processes. This process stimulates nascent entrepreneurs to consider alternatives, such as extending expertise outside the start-up. Moreover, we find that these processes support entrepreneurs and their teams in improving their decision-making processes. The findings support that nascent entrepreneurs rely heavily on the input of others in their start-up creation process, and contribute to new empirical insights about entrepreneurial metacognition. A dynamic model in which these relationships emerge is developed. The study’s results contribute to a better understanding of the antecedents and consequences of metacognitive processes in nascent entrepreneurship.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","1775-1805","","4","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There has been little discussion in the literature to show how STPs could make an attractive environment to absorb and retain potential firms. This is even more challenging for specialized STPs in health sector. The aim of this study is to identify the attractive factors for firms in a STP in health sector. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review method was undertaken to review the literature on seven databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus, ProQuest, Google Scholar, EconPapers, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science) for peer-reviewed articles published until 2019. The search results were screened against the inclusion of criteria to ensure they met the objectives. The eligible papers were then assessed on the basis of the full text, and finally the results were extracted. RESULTS: The attractive factors for firms and talents in multidimensional STPs and those in health sector are extracted and summarized. The attractive factors of multidimensional STPs, which includes health sector firms, and those specialized in health sector are summarized in three main categories; factors created by government and universities, and factors related to STP policies and those expected by the firms. CONCLUSION: To make STPs attractive for firms in health sector, there is a list of factors that are required to be done not only by STP itself, but also by the national and local government and industries. It is important to consider the factors that are expected by the firms to be implemented. The results of this study suggest that making STPs attractive for health sector firms needs close collaboration between government, universities, related industries, and STPs all together.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","207","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their evaluation often includes categorizing the behavior change techniques (BCTs) using a classification system of which the BCT Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) is one of the most common. Previous studies have presented descriptive summaries of behavior change interventions delivered by CAs, but no in-depth study reporting the use of BCTs in these interventions has been published to date. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to describe behavior change interventions delivered by CAs and to identify the BCTs and theories guiding their design. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the first 10 pages of Google and Google Scholar in April 2021. We included primary, experimental studies evaluating a behavior change intervention delivered by a CA. BCTs coding followed the BCTTv1. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data. Descriptive analysis and frequent itemset mining to identify BCT clusters were performed. RESULTS: We included 47 studies reporting on mental health (n=19, 40%), chronic disorders (n=14, 30%), and lifestyle change (n=14, 30%) interventions. There were 20/47 embodied CAs (43%) and 27/47 CAs (57%) represented a female character. Most CAs were rule based (34/47, 72%). Experimental interventions included 63 BCTs, (mean 9 BCTs; range 2-21 BCTs), while comparisons included 32 BCTs (mean 2 BCTs; range 2-17 BCTs). Most interventions included BCTs 4.1 ""Instruction on how to perform a behavior"" (34/47, 72%), 3.3 ""Social support"" (emotional; 27/47, 57%), and 1.2 ""Problem solving"" (24/47, 51%). A total of 12/47 studies (26%) were informed by a behavior change theory, mainly the Transtheoretical Model and the Social Cognitive Theory. Studies using the same behavior change theory included different BCTs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for the more explicit use of behavior change theories and improved reporting of BCTs in CA interventions to enhance the analysis of intervention effectiveness and improve the reproducibility of research.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:00","2025-07-26 09:59:00","","e39243","","10","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care. METHODS: We followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study. RESULTS: The Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cutting considerations-user-centered design and privacy and security-that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle changes and prevent type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Drawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and safety concerns.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:01","2025-07-26 09:59:01","","e38740","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effectiveness of university-based companies has also been questioned, as many of them are resource-constrained, remain small in size and struggle to consolidate once they leave the university context. This paper addresses two main research questions: what are the critical factors inhibiting the consolidation, performance, and sustainable development of university spin-offs at a mid-range European university, and which critical factors need to be addressed the most thoroughly by the university’s support programs in order to improve their efficiency? To answer these questions, we collected relevant information from a panel of experts and interviewed academic entrepreneurs from a public university in the South of Spain. The analytic hierarchy process was applied to identify and prioritize the critical factors and sub-factors encountered by the university-based companies. The results show that poor management is the biggest critical factor in the consolidation of the spin-offs. One implication, the findings of our study reveal, is the need for university administrators to improve support for university spin-offs in terms of managing the new business as opposed to prioritizing the difficulties associated with the launch. Another is the need to raise awareness among faculties of the importance of finding an appropriate balance between technical and managerial skills in order to improve the chances of entrepreneurial success.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:01","2025-07-26 09:59:01","","12628","","19","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We index key features to predict responses prior to starting treatment using subjective self-report questionnaires, experimental tasks, biological samples, ecological momentary assessments, activity tracking, and smartphone-based passive sensing to derive a multimodal feature set for predictive modeling. Additional assessments take place weekly at mid- and posttreatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups to index anxiety and depression symptom severity. We aim to include 150 patients, randomized to CBT versus WAIT at a 3:1 ratio. The data set will be subject to full feature and important features selected by minimal redundancy and maximal relevance feature selection and then fed into machine leaning models, including eXtreme gradient boosting, pattern recognition network, and k-nearest neighbors to forecast treatment response. The performance of the developed models will be evaluated. In addition to predictive modeling, we will test specific mechanistic hypotheses (eg, association between self-efficacy, daily symptoms obtained using ecological momentary assessments, and treatment response) to elucidate mechanisms underlying treatment response. RESULTS: The trial is now completed. It was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee, Zurich. The results will be disseminated through publications in scientific peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this trial is to improve current CBT treatment by precise forecasting of treatment response and by understanding and potentially augmenting underpinning mechanisms and personalizing treatment.

This paper aims to examine how academic intrapreneurs perceive and respond to organizational factors set by departments, faculties, schools, and university boards that influence knowledge transfer, the initiation of an internal project, and the collaboration with societal stakeholders. We employ an embedded case study approach to examine the role of perceived control and influence within the internal work environment of a knowledge commercialization process within the DiabetesStation, a healthcare innovation at the Erasmus Medical Center (MC), a university hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We used a semi-structured interview strategy and analyzed 12 individual respondent interviews. The results show that the relationship between academics and the Knowledge Commercialization Process within the DS at Erasmus MC was influenced by six factors (i.e., external collaboration, product quality, time availability, external financing, internal financing, and rewards and reinforcement). Our study highlights that the perception of- the academic intrapreneur’s control and influence seems to impact effectively transferring academic knowledge from academic institutions to the private sector for economic and societal benefit. The research results highlight three controllable areas of an academic institution’s internal work environment that can enhance the relationship between knowledge valorization and academic intrapreneurship—time availability, rewards and reinforcement, and internal financing.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:01","2025-07-26 19:43:29","","1-29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is worth noting that the research tasks undertaken will be both quantitative and qualitative. The data search was conducted on 31 August 2022, and the selected peer-reviewed database was Scopus. The exclusion process resulted in a total of 607 journal and conference papers. The most important conclusion to be derived from this study is that there is no one unified definition of the SED. Moreover, three activities must be undertaken to realize the SED concept: (1) increasing the use of renewable energy sources in the energy mix, (2) enhancing energy efficiency, and (3) reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants.

International guidelines consider patient education and movement exercises as the preferred therapeutic option for unspecific and degenerative musculoskeletal conditions. Innovative and decentralized therapeutic means are required to provide access to and availability of such care to meet the increasing therapeutic demand for this spectrum of conditions. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective observational study of preliminary use and outcome data explores the clinical outcomes of Vivira (hereafter referred to as ""program""), a smartphone-based program for unspecific and degenerative pain in the back, hip, and knee before it received regulatory approval for use in the German statutory health insurance system. METHODS: An incomplete matched block design was employed to assess pain score changes over the intended 12-week duration of the program. Post hoc analyses were performed. In addition, a matched comparison of self-reported functional scores and adherence rates is presented. RESULTS: A total of 2517 participants met the inclusion criteria and provided sufficient data to be included in the analyses. Overall, initial self-reported pain scores decreased significantly from an average of 5.19 out of 10 (SD 1.96) to an average of 3.35 out of 10 (SD 2.38) after 12 weeks. Post hoc analyses indicate a particularly emphasized pain score reduction over the early use phases. Additionally, participants with back pain showed significant improvements in strength and mobility scores, whereas participants with hip or knee pain demonstrated significant improvements in their coordination scores. Across all pain areas and pain durations, a high yet expected attrition rate could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study provides the first insights into the clinical outcomes of an exercise program for unspecific and degenerative back, hip, and knee pain. Furthermore, it demonstrates a potential secondary benefit of improved functionality (ie, strength, mobility, coordination). However, as this study lacks confirmatory power, further research is required to substantiate the clinical outcomes of the program assessed.

Coronary obstruction and subsequent myocardial ischemia result in the progressive replacement of contractile myocardium with dysfunctional, fibrotic scar tissue. Post-infarctional remodelling is causal for the concomitant decline of left-ventricular function and the fatal syndrome of heart failure. Available neurohumoral treatment strategies aim at the improvement of symptoms. Despite extensive research, therapeutic options for myocardial regeneration, including (stem)-cell therapy, gene therapy, cellular reprogramming or tissue engineering, remain purely experimental. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need for novel treatment options for inducing myocardial regeneration and improving left-ventricular function in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Shockwave therapy (SWT) is a well-established regenerative tool that is effective for the treatment of chronic tendonitis, long-bone non-union and wound-healing disorders. In preclinical trials, SWT regenerated ischemic myocardium via the induction of angiogenesis and the reduction of fibrotic scar tissue, resulting in improved left-ventricular function.MethodsIn this prospective, randomized controlled, single-blind, monocentric study, 80 patients with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF≤ 40%) are subjected to coronary-artery bypass-graft surgery (CABG) surgery and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive additional cardiac SWT (intervention group; 40 patients) or CABG surgery with sham treatment (control group; 40 patients). This study aims to evaluate (1) the safety and (2) the efficacy of cardiac SWT as adjunctive treatment during CABG surgery for the regeneration of ischemic myocardium. The primary endpoints of the study represent (1) major cardiac events and (2) changes in left-ventricular function 12 months after treatment. Secondary endpoints include 6-min walk test distance, improvement of symptoms and assessment of quality of life.DiscussionThis study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of cardiac SWT during CABG surgery for myocardial regeneration. The induction of angiogenesis, decrease of fibrotic scar tissue formation and, thus, improvement of left-ventricular function could lead to improved quality of life and prognosis for patients with ischemic heart failure. Thus, it could become the first clinically available treatment strategy for the regeneration of ischemic myocardium alleviating the socio-economic burden of heart failure.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03859466.

Therefore, this research sought to comprehensively examine all peer reviewed articles on public sector entrepreneurship. Methods : Using the Scopus scientific database, our analysis included 133 articles from 1982 to 2022. Following a thorough manual review process, we used VOSviewer to provide a mapping of the field, before identifying research gaps and suggesting directions for future research. Our scientific mapping revealed the leading and emerging thematic clusters in the field. Results : Our results revealed that the leading themes in public sector entrepreneurship include innovation, entrepreneurship, public sector, governance, reinventing government, and public organisations, while emerging trends include public health entrepreneurship, public health innovation, public choice, sustainability, and entrepreneurial orientation, among others.

This framework builds on the paradigmatic foundations of critical realism and is used to conduct a realist synthesis of the existing literature. Our findings support an extension of the temporal boundaries of commercialisation towards innovation, placing increasing emphasis on user-entrepreneurs and organisations. Moreover, our analysis shows that there is merit in understanding the choices they make, from a kaleidoscope of alternatives visible to them, at specific junctures.

Research shows that a large number of employees perceive that their qualification level exceeds the formal requirements of the position. These people may spontaneously seek to change their current situation and dare to develop innovative ideas in an unconventional way. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between overqualification and bootlegging through the mediating effect of proactive career behavior on the basis of the human environment matching theory. This study also explored the moderating effect of a proactive personality between overqualification and bootlegging. This study shows that leaders should prioritize the potential of overqualified employees, encourage them to engage in challenging tasks, broaden the innovation channels of individuals and organizations, and monitor bootlegging activities. Highly motivated employees with overqualifications are more likely to actively plan and manage their careers, they will actively seek innovation to solve problems when encountering obstacles in their career development. Participants and Methods: In this study, 457 questionnaires were collected from employees of many enterprises in Hunan Province and Guangdong Province of China. Partial least squares structural equation model based on variance (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. Results: The results of the study reveal that there is a significant relationship between overqualification and bootlegging. In addition, proactive career behavior plays an intermediary role in the relationship between overqualification and bootlegging. Moreover, a proactive personality moderates the relationship between overqualification and bootlegging. Finally, the relationship between overqualification and bootlegging is stronger when a proactive personality is strong.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:01","2025-07-26 09:59:01","","3845-3859","","0","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study then uses Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to identify the different configurations of factors that lead to strategic agility. Finally, we complement QCA analysis by performing a case study for each of the configurations that lead to strategic agility. The study reveals that there is no necessary condition to reach strategic agility and that companies reach it in five main ways, depending on different combinations of six factors: firm size, firm age, whether the firm is international, whether it competes in a turbulent environment, and whether the firm invests in i) capabilities and technologies, and ii) additional revenue models or cost-cutting mechanisms or not.","2022","2025-07-26 09:59:01","2025-07-26 09:59:01","","599-627","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the determinants of formal institutions around new areas of economic activities. Specifically, we propose a framework for understanding how the quality of formal institutions in promoting entrepreneurship drives the focus of such institutions concerning initial coin offering (ICO), which is emerging as a popular fundraising method. The paper uses inductive analysis to examine how nonmarket factors—such as a jurisdiction’s tax haven nature, regulators’ perceptions of ICOs as threats to national or political interests, and trade and industry associations—might moderate the relationship between the quality of institutions and the focus of such institutions regarding ICOs. One of this study’s key findings is that an economy’s quality of entrepreneurship-related institutions, perceived threats to national/political interests, and tax haven nature lead to different policy orientations. Consequently, regulators assign different importance when promoting crypto-entrepreneurship and dealing with associated risks. Regulators focusing mainly on promoting crypto-ventures have taken measures to enrich the blockchain ecosystem and provided tax and non-tax incentives to attract such ventures. Regulators focusing mainly on dealing with crypto-venture risks rely on a regulatory sandbox and close regulatory monitoring of such ventures.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:01","2025-07-26 09:59:01","","9","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article focuses on social innovation and whether this concept holds promise to enhance equity in health services to achieve UHC and serve as a process to enhance community engagement, participation, and agency.MethodsA cross-country case study methodology was adopted to analyze three social innovations in health in three low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): Philippines, Malawi, and Colombia. Qualitative methods were used in data collection, and a cross-case analysis was conducted with the aid of a simplified version of the conceptual framework on social innovation as proposed by Cajaiba-Santana. This framework proposes four dimensions of social innovation as a process at different levels of action: the actors responsible for the idea, the new idea, the role of the institutional environment, and the resultant changes in the health and social system.ResultsThe study found that each of the three social innovation case studies was based on developing community capacities to achieve health through community co-learning, leadership, and accountability.The process was dependent on catalytic agents, creating a space for innovation within the institutional context. In so doing, these agents challenged the prevailing power dynamics by providing the communities with respect and the opportunity to participate equally in creating and implementing programs. In this way, communities were empowered; they were not simply participants but became active agents in conceptualizing, implementing, monitoring, and sustaining the social innovation initiatives.ConclusionThe study has illustrated how three creative social innovation approaches improved access and quality of health services for vulnerable rural populations and increased agency among the intervention communities. The processes facilitated empowerment, which in turn supported the sustained strengthening of the community system and the achievement of community goals in the domain of health and beyond.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:02","2025-07-26 09:59:02","","55","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electronic systems can be used to achieve the goal of collecting data from heterogeneous datasets and to support multicenter clinical trials. The <i>Ligurian Infectious Diseases Network</i> (LIDN) is a web-based platform for data collection and reuse originating from a regional effort and involving many professionals from different fields. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to present an integrated system of ad hoc interfaces and tools that we use to perform pseudonymous clinical data collection, both manually and automatically, to support clinical trials. METHODS: The project comprehends different scenarios of data collection systems, according to the degree of <i>information technology</i> of the involved centers. To be compliant with national regulations, the last developed connection is based on the standard <i>Clinical Document Architecture Release 2</i> by <i>Health Level 7</i> guidelines, interoperability is supported by the involvement of a terminology service. RESULTS: Since 2011, the LIDN platform has involved more than 8,000 patients from eight different hospitals, treated or under treatment for at least one infectious disease among <i>human immunodeficiency virus</i> (HIV), <i>hepatitis C virus</i>, <i>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</i>, and tuberculosis. Since 2013, systems for the automatic transfer of laboratory data have been updating patients' information for three centers, daily. Direct communication was set up between the LIDN architecture and three of the main national cohorts of HIV-infected patients. CONCLUSION: The LIDN was originally developed to support clinicians involved in the project in the management of data from HIV-infected patients through a web-based tool that could be easily used in primary-care units. Then, the developed system grew modularly to respond to the specific needs that arose over a time span of more than 10 years.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:02","2025-07-26 09:59:02","","016-027","","01","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use a sample of Spanish spin-offs, with four dependent variables reflecting internationalization types and a large selection of independent variables reflecting various domains considered in the extant literature. Logistic regression is applied to outline marginal effects and prediction accuracies. The results show that academic spin-offs which are oriented towards international markets from the beginning of their activities and constantly pursue new international opportunities are more likely to internationalize fast and remain international for a longer time period than other firms. Being the first to introduce product or process innovations and co-operating with international government institutions, competitors, customers, and/or suppliers is also relatively useful for such internationalizers. The study also demonstrates that predicting if an academic spin-off will become a less active internationalizer results in a higher accuracy than forecasting if it will become a born global. Moreover, predicting if a firm will internationalize later results in a higher accuracy than forecasting if this will happen during the first three years since the spin-off's foundation.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:02","2025-07-26 09:59:02","","e13172","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in particular academia and small-scale private sector innovators underappreciate the value of patent information for identifying research gaps, ensuring originality of their work and, in turn, maximisation of limited (public) funds. By the same token, pertinent public sector organisations, such as regulators, require overviews of potentially upcoming technologies to adequately adapt regulatory protocols. The latter, in particular if contemporary scientific evidence is not sufficient, can require a substantial amount of time and lead to a delay in the marketing of important innovations. Patent landscape analysis (PLA) is a very useful method to create overviews of technology fields and thereby indicate if, inter alia, a specific line of scientific enquiry and its application have already been pursued or potential regulatory gaps will exist in the near- to mid-term future. The objective of this communication is to increase awareness of the utility of patent information and provide support in retrieval and analysis of pertinent information for those involved in biotech R&D. Based on Espacenet, a patent search engine, we provide basic guidance on search strategy development, piloting and execution, and data preparation and analysis.

An analysis of 53 semi-structured interviews reveals three sensemaking narratives demonstrating how scientists’ interactions with the industry have engendered perceived shifts in ‘regimes of value’ in universities. These narratives focus on: (1) bi-directional learning between academy and industry; (2) the use of new valuation devices and practices; and (3) changing relationships between scientists and universities.

As part of a larger research project that focuses on retaining women in the Australian construction industry, this research conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The objective is to explore the factors that influence women’s careers and their experiences in the Australian construction industry that have been identified in the literature over the past three decades. Additionally, the findings are anticipated to inform future efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of current initiatives to retain women and develop a framework for enhancing women’s experiences and retaining them in this profession. This SLR revealed that excessive and rigid work hours, gendered culture and informal rules, limited career development opportunities, and negative perceptions of women’s abilities are the main factors and issues that cause women to leave the industry. Among these, rigid and long work hours seem to be the foremost factor to be prioritised. Understanding the roles of key variables in driving this cultural change is important to ensure that concrete progress is made.

This study attempts to explore the mechanism of how academic entrepreneurial intention is shaped, with job-related negative elements as push factors, and entrepreneurship-related positive attractors as pull factors. Methods: In this paper, regression analysis and Bootstrap were conducted using SPSS 26.0 and MPLUS 7.0, whose applicability has been widely demonstrated in research. Results: Findings were derived from 1042 academics from Chinese universities. Results showed that both push and pull factors do contribute to boosting academic entrepreneurial intention. Particularly, the entrepreneurship-related pull factors including entrepreneurial opportunity identification and expected entrepreneurial benefits play a dominant role in trigging academic intention to engaging entrepreneurship. Moreover, our findings further confirmed the moderating role of social network in the process of academics pushed by negative job-related factors to emerge entrepreneurial intention. Discussion: This study extends the research perspective on the factors influencing academic entrepreneurial intention by examines the impact of push and pull factors on academic entrepreneurial intention simultaneously. This deepens the formation mechanism of academic entrepreneurial intention. Besides, the current study identifies a new look at the role that social network plays in academic entrepreneurship.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:02","2025-07-26 09:59:02","","1073866","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Entrepreneurs can benefit from venture creation and commercialization training that is largely absent from standard biomedical educational curricula. The NYU Biomedical Entrepreneurship Educational Program (BEEP) seeks to fill this training gap to prepare and motivate biomedical entrepreneurs to develop an entrepreneurial skill set, thus accelerating the pace of innovation in technology and business ventures. Methods: The NYU BEEP Model was developed and implemented with funding from NIDDK and NCATS. The program consists of a core introductory course, topic-based interdisciplinary workshops, venture challenges, on-line modules, and mentorship from experts. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of the core, introductory course, ""Foundations of Biomedical Startups,"" through the use of pre/post-course surveys and free-response answers. Results: After 2 years, 153 participants (26% doctoral students, 23% post-doctoral PhDs, 20% faculty, 16% research staff, 15% other) have completed the course. Evaluation data show self-assessed knowledge gain in all domains.

They are also an important tool for policymakers and higher education institutions to stimulate entrepreneurial activity and support new entrepreneurial ventures from conceptual and financial standpoints. Academic research has kept pace with the rising interest in BPCs over the past decades, especially regarding their implications for entrepreneurial education. Literature on BPCs has grown slowly but steadily over the years, offering important insights that entrepreneurship scholars must collectively evaluate to inform theory and practice. Yet, no attempt has been made to perform a systematic review and synthesis of BPC literature. Therefore, to highlight emerging trends and draw pathways to future research, the authors adopted a systematic approach to synthesize the literature on BPCs. The authors performed a systematic literature review on 58 articles on BPCs. Several themes emerge from the BPC literature, including BPCs investigated as prime opportunities to develop entrepreneurial education, the effects of BPC participation on future entrepreneurial activity, and several attempts to frame an ideal BPC blueprint for future contests. However, several research gaps emerge, especially regarding the lack of theoretical underpinnings in the literature stream and the predominance of exploratory research. This paper provides guidance for practice by presenting a roadmap for future research on BPCs drawing from the sample reviewed. From a theoretical perspective, the study offers several prompts for further research on the topic through a concept map and a structured research agenda.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:03","2025-07-26 09:59:03","","863-895","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is evidence that professional stereotypes inhibit effective interprofessional teamwork, but they haven't been explored as a phenomenon that impacts team's performance and quality of care. Objectives: To focus on professional stereotypes emerging in interprofessional teams and examine the contingency effects of interprofessional team's faultlines, professional stereotypes, and leader's championship behaviors on team's quality of care. Methods: A cross-sectional nested sample of 59 interprofessional teams and 284 professionals, working in geriatric long-term-care facilities in Israel. Additionally, five to seven of the residents of each facility were randomly sampled to obtain the outcome variable. Data collection employed a multisource (interprofessional team members), multimethod (validated questionnaires and data from residents' health records) strategy. Results: The results indicated that faultlines are not directly harmful to team's quality of care; instead, they are likely to impact quality of care only when team stereotypes emerge. Furthermore, whereas teams typified by high professional stereotypes require person-oriented championship leadership, for teams typified by low team stereotypes, championship leadership harms the quality of care they provide. Conclusion: These findings have implications for handling interprofessional teams.

For some organisations, it has become an ethical crisis. This is certainly the case for large organisations in Australia, where the way many enterprises handled a government wage subsidy called JobKeeper led to a public backlash, media pressure, and a variety of responses ranging from ‘We acted legally’ to the full return of the subsidy. Some organisations later reported profits, and the public response indicated concern about this behaviour, many considering it immoral despite it being legally compliant. It is, we contend, a question to which stakeholder theory can be applied, examining how organisations view and respond to the public. We use content analysis of mainstream media to provide information about public reactions and information from official sources to confirm corporate action. We show that there is a significant ethical component in the public response to the behaviour of organisations as they respond to the crisis. COVID has been an ethical, health, and financial crisis for these organisations.

It is crucial for the field to be historically positioned under relevant themes, internally connected in terms of conceptual foundations, and systematically categorised in consonance with previously utilised frameworks of analysis. These concerns are resolved in this study by conducting a bibliometric analysis of 672 relevant articles. This form of analysis has not been previously employed on the topic of entrepreneurial teams. First, this study identifies eight main thematic clusters in the entrepreneurial teams field and their sub-themes. The eight main thematic clusters are: (i) Intellectual Capital, (ii) Cognition and Behaviour, (iii) Science and Technology, (iv) Finance, (v) Transformation, (vi) Internationalisation, (vii) Family, and (viii) Community and Surroundings.

Academic research and training programmes have contributed towards policy entrepreneurship in a manner that influenced capacity-building within health systems. However, the documented capacity-building frameworks rarely elucidate how such programmes can be designed and implemented efficiently and sustainably.MethodWe implemented the University of Zimbabwe (UZ)–State University of New York at Buffalo (UB) collaborative HIV clinical pharmacology capacity-building programme in Zimbabwe in 1998. We intuitively operationalized the programme around a mnemonic acronym, “RSTUVW”, which spells out a supportive framework consisting of “room (space), skills, tools (equipment)”, underpinned by a set of core values, “understanding, voice (clout) and will”. Subsequent to our two decades of successful collaborative experience, we tested the general validity and applicability of the framework within a prospective programme aimed at expanding the role of health professionals.Results and conclusionBased on this collaborative North–South research and training capacity-building programme which has been positively validated in Zimbabwe, we propose this novel mnemonic acronym-based framework as an extra tool to guide sustainable capacity-building through collaborative North–South implementation research. Its extended use could also include assessment and evaluation of health systems within resource-constrained settings.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:04","2025-07-26 09:59:04","","24","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review is the first to chart and appraise the osteopathic pedagogical literature and presents recommendations for further research and practice. Methods A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted of EBSCO, OVID (Embase, Medline), CINAHL, Psycinfo, Open Grey, ProQuest and ERIC databases, to identify research related to osteopathic education. Review, selection, data extraction, characterization and Risk of Bias was performed by two independent reviewers and results were summarised using Critical Interpretive Synthesis. Results The search identified 66 research papers published from 2002 to 2022. The included papers varied in terms of purpose, methodology, and detail of reporting. The returns were grouped into five categories Teaching, Assessment, Clinical education and preparedness for practice, Curriculum and Miscellaneous. The evidence is generally of robust methodological quality, with bias rated as 29 Low, 26 Moderate, and 11 High. However, most of the methodological designs would traditionally be considered low on the hierarchy of evidence, with 19 commentary articles and the only Randomised Controlled Trial being rated High risk of bias. Conclusions The evidence regarding what is taught is underdeveloped and enhancing consensus regarding benchmarking of osteopathic education and minimum competencies is needed. Active learning was an area highlighted as preferred by learners as was self-directed study. This may also integrate more practical learning aids and electronic or online learning.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:04","2025-07-26 09:59:04","","100663","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smart campuses are often perceived as miniature replicas of smart cities and serve as living labs for smart technology research, development, and adoption, along with their traditional teaching, learning and research functions. There is currently a limited understanding of how the smart campus is conceptualized and practiced. This paper addresses this gap by using a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. The study uses four major domains of the smart campus, i.e., society, economy, environment, and governance, to classify existing research. These domains are each aligned to the central smart campus concepts of digital technology and big data. The analysis found little evidence of a comprehensive real-world application of the smart campus towards addressing all four domains. This highlights the infancy of the current conceptualization and practice. The findings contribute to the development of a new conceptual foundation and research directions for the smart campus notion and informs its practice through a conceptual framework. The findings reported in this paper offer a firm basis for comprehensive smart campus conceptualization, and also provide directions for future research and development of smart campuses.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:04","2025-07-26 09:59:04","","891","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To answer the question-What are the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities in university technology transfer?-this study investigates in-depth organizational-level dynamic capabilities in transferring university-based knowledge to business and society. Two qualitative case studies were deployed at organizational entities at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam: the Industry Alliance Office, and the Demonstrator Lab. These two organizations stimulate science- and business-oriented university technology transfer. In this context, the micro-foundations of the dynamic capabilities ""sensing"", ""seizing"" and ""reconfiguring"" are identified and discussed. For ""sensing"", which is the university's ability to explore the opportunities in the ecosystem, the micro-foundations are ""selecting internal competency"" and ""sensing external partners"". For ""seizing"", which supports universities in managing complementarity with industry and society, micro-foundations include ""resource co-allocation"" and ""collaborative business model"". The micro-foundations of ""reconfiguring"", through which universities maintain evolutionary fitness in the innovation ecosystem, are ""strategic renewal"", ""establishing a university technology transfer-friendly environment"", and ""asset orchestration"". This study provides researchers with a better understanding of how dynamic capabilities facilitate university technology transfer.

Design/methodology/approach Following the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, a domain-based literature review has been accomplished. Consistently with the study purpose, a hybrid methodology has been designed. Bibliographic coupling permitted us to discover the research streams populating the scientific debate. The core arguments addressed within and across the streams were reported through an interpretive approach. Findings Starting from an intellectual core of 94 contributions, 5 research streams were spotted. OI in the public sector unfolds through an evolutionary path. Public sector entities conventionally acted as “senior partners” of privately-owned companies, providing funding (yellow cluster) and data (purple cluster) to nurture OI. An advanced perspective envisages OI as a public management model purposefully enacted by public sector entities to co-create value with relevant stakeholders (red cluster).

Educational Robotics is one of the most popular innovative methodologies that supports the development of many skills by assembling and programming robots in a meaningful way. In this paper, the authors aim at advancing their previous work in the field of Educational Robotics applied to the marine environment by proposing a novel bioinspired educational toolkit whose design and features support activities concerning sustainability, ocean literacy, as well as STEM subjects in kindergarten through to grade twelve education. Exploiting the established educational theories and methodologies underpinning Educational Robotics, the toolkit allows for marine-themed activities, as well promoting activities concerning STEM subjects. To explain the relevance of the toolkit, the authors present the robot design, the workshops that every teacher or student can explore as an Open Educational Resource (OERs), and the results of a case study.

Methods: Fourteen participants with a desire to eat healthier and exercise more (6 normal weight and 8 PLWO; Mean age = 41.86, <i>SD</i> = 13.89) were assigned to the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). EG participants, after being trained on motivational interviewing skills, engaged in a virtual self-conversation using embodiment and body swapping techniques, which aimed to normalize and resolve their ambivalence to change lifestyle habits. CG participants, embodied in their virtual bodies, participated in a pre-established discourse with a virtual counselor giving them psychoeducational advice about how to change lifestyle habits. A mixed-methods design was used, involving a semi-structured interview and self-report questionnaires, including readiness to change habits (Readiness Rulers), body ownership (Body Ownership Questionnaire, BOQ), and system usability (System Evaluation Questionnaire, SEQ).

Interventions targeting healthy lifestyle behaviours through mobile technologies, including new approaches such as chatbots, may be an effective, low-cost approach to prevent these conditions. To ensure uptake and engagement with mobile health interventions, however, it is essential to understand the end-users’ perspectives on using such interventions. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions, barriers, and facilitators to the use of mobile health interventions for lifestyle behaviour change in Singapore.MethodsSix virtual focus group discussions were conducted with a total of 34 participants (mean ± SD; aged 45 ± 3.6 years; 64.7% females). Focus group recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach, followed by deductive mapping according to perceptions, barriers, facilitators, mixed factors, or strategies.ResultsFive themes were identified: (i) holistic wellbeing is central to healthy living (i.e., the importance of both physical and mental health); (ii) encouraging uptake of a mobile health intervention is influenced by factors such as incentives and government backing; (iii) trying out a mobile health intervention is one thing, sticking to it long term is another and there are key factors, such as personalisation and ease of use that influence sustained engagement with mobile health interventions; (iv) perceptions of chatbots as a tool to support healthy lifestyle behaviour are influenced by previous negative experiences with chatbots, which might hamper uptake; and (v) sharing health-related data is OK, but with conditions such as clarity on who will have access to the data, how it will be stored, and for what purpose it will be used.ConclusionsFindings highlight several factors that are relevant for the development and implementation of mobile health interventions in Singapore and other Asian countries.

This study provides a holistic analysis of the effect of CE institutional policies on the development of CEBMs in organisations, by exploring not only production-oriented policies, which have been the focus of previous research, but also consumption policies. Consumption policies, in the form of regulatory and information policies, are oriented towards consumers and have the potential to affect the demand for CE products, which in turn affects the development of CEBMs in organisations. The paper is framed within the institutional theory and the context of the European Union. Our results reveal that consumption policies have a positive, albeit diminishing, effect on the CEBMs. Our paper finds that regulation is the most impactful policy, having a larger impact than production policies.

It can be supported by modifying lifestyle factors such as physical activity and diet. Poor mental health, in turn, contributes to the opposing effect. The promotion of healthy ageing may therefore benefit from holistic interventions integrating physical activity, diet and mental health. These interventions can be scaled up to the population level by using mobile technologies. However, systematic evidence regarding the characteristics and effectiveness of such holistic mHealth interventions remains limited. This paper presents a protocol for a systematic review that aims to provide an overview of the current state of the evidence for holistic mHealth interventions, including their characteristics and effects on behavioural and health outcomes in general adult populations . METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies of interventions published between January 2011 and April 2022 in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Google Scholar (first 200 records). Eligible studies will be mHealth interventions targeting general adult populations with content on physical activity, diet and mental health. We will extract information on all relevant behavioural and health outcomes, as well as those related to intervention feasibility. Screening and data extraction processes will be carried out independently by two reviewers. Cochrane risk-of-bias tools will be used to assess risk of bias. We will provide a narrative overview of the findings from eligible studies. With sufficient data, a meta-analysis will be conducted.

This essay brings together the institutional logics perspective and racialized organization theory to first examine aspects of special education and then describe how leaders and teachers can improve special education to target inequities. We illustrate features of three logics of special education: compliance, intervention, and equity. We explain how these logics are racialized structures in the special education field.

Next, we highlight how infrastructure enables leaders and teachers to enact the equity model of special education. In sum, this essay encourages improving infrastructural elements and confronting racism and ableism to re-envision special education in the face of COVID-disruptions.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","655-674","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore this phenomenon, we completed 10 qualitative interviews at ten different higher education institutions across Norway in fall 2020. The informants were strategically selected among employees who had been involved in open platform technology, MOOC production and support for faculties. Adopting thematic analyses, we found entrepreneurs who positioned themselves in pockets of innovation with the intention to transform teaching and learning. Rather than seeing technological innovations as “more of the same”, the entrepreneurs embraced the possibilities emerging in new educational practices. Inspired by New Institutionalism, we focused on the organizational conditions for MOOC production. The entrepreneurs often entered interpretive struggles at higher organizational levels in competition with other stakeholders. Despite national initiatives and funding, many stakeholders questioned the value of MOOCs. Our study points to discrepancies in understanding the disruptive and transformative change that new technology can bring to study programs and lifelong learning. The informants also experienced insufficient support from leaders and lamented the lack of a national platform for open online access. We link these findings to embedded theories, belief systems and discourses in educational cultures and management in Higher Education.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","617-654","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lifestyle interventions <i>via</i> mobile apps and conversational agents present themselves as low-cost, scalable solutions to prevent these conditions. This paper describes the rationale for, and development of, ""LvL UP 1.0″, a smartphone-based lifestyle intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. Materials and Methods: A multidisciplinary team led the intervention design process of LvL UP 1.0, involving four phases: (i) preliminary research (stakeholder consultations, systematic market reviews), (ii) selecting intervention components and developing the conceptual model, (iii) whiteboarding and prototype design, and (iv) testing and refinement. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy and the UK Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions were used to guide the intervention development. Results: Preliminary research highlighted the importance of targeting holistic wellbeing (i.e., both physical and mental health). Accordingly, the first version of LvL UP features a scalable, smartphone-based, and conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention built around three pillars: Move More (physical activity), Eat Well (nutrition and healthy eating), and Stress Less (emotional regulation and wellbeing). Intervention components include health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily ""Life Hacks"" (healthy activity suggestions), breathing exercises, and journaling. In addition to the intervention components, formative research also stressed the need to introduce engagement-specific components to maximise uptake and long-term use. LvL UP includes a motivational interviewing and storytelling approach to deliver the coaching sessions, as well as progress feedback and gamification. Offline materials are also offered to allow users access to essential intervention content without needing a mobile device. Conclusions: The development process of LvL UP 1.0 led to an evidence-based and user-informed smartphone-based intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. LvL UP is designed to be a scalable, engaging, prevention-oriented, holistic intervention for adults at risk of NCDs and CMDs. A feasibility study, and subsequent optimisation and randomised-controlled trials are planned to further refine the intervention and establish effectiveness. The development process described here may prove helpful to other intervention developers.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","1039171","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study included 706 participants, both men and women, from different age groups and living in various regions of Ukraine. The data were collected from August till October 2022. Results: The study found that a large portion of the Ukrainian population shows increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress due to the war. Women were found to be more vulnerable to mental health issues than men, and younger people were found to be more resilient. Worsened financial and employment statuses predicted increased anxiety. Ukrainians who fled the conflict to other countries exhibited higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Direct exposure to trauma predicted increased anxiety and depression, while war-related exposure to ""other stressful events"" predicted increased acute stress levels.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a method for frameless one-insertion needle biopsies with in situ optical guidance and present a processing pipeline for combined postoperative analysis of optical, MRI, and neuropathological data. An optical system for quantified feedback on tissue microcirculation, gray-whiteness, and the presence of a tumor (protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) accumulation) with a one-insertion optical probe was integrated into a needle biopsy kit that was used for frameless neuronavigation. In Python, a pipeline for signal processing, image registration, and coordinate transformation was set up. The Euclidian distances between the pre- and postoperative coordinates were calculated. The proposed workflow was evaluated on static references, a phantom, and three patients with suspected high-grade gliomas. In total, six biopsy samples that overlapped with the region of the highest PpIX peak without increased microcirculation were taken. The samples were confirmed as being tumorous and postoperative imaging was used to define the biopsy locations. A 2.5 ± 1.2 mm difference between the pre- and postoperative coordinates was found. Optical guidance in frameless brain tumor biopsies could offer benefits such as quantified in situ indication of high-grade tumor tissue and indications of increased blood flow along the needle trajectory before the tissue is removed. Additionally, postoperative visualization enables the combined analysis of MRI, optical, and neuropathological data.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","809","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Malawian policy framework recognizes the value of communities and citizens, as co-creators of health and leaders of localized and innovative initiatives, such as social innovations.Social innovations involve and include communities and citizens, as well as bring about changes in the institutions responsible for care delivery. In this article, we describe the institutionalization process of a citizen-initiated primary care social innovation, named Chipatala Cha Pa Foni, focused on extending access to health information and appropriate service-seeking behavior.An interdisciplinary multi-method qualitative case study design was adopted, drawing on data collected from key informant interviews, observations, and documents over an 18-month period. A composite social innovation framework, informed by institutional theory and positive organizational scholarship, guided the thematic content analysis. Institutional-level changes were analyzed in five key dimensions as well as the role of actors, operating as institutional entrepreneurs, in this process.A subset of actors matched the definition of operating as Institutional Entrepreneurs. They worked in close collaboration to bring about changes in five institutional dimensions: roles, resource flows, authority flows, social identities and meanings. We highlight the changing role of nurses; redistribution and decentralization of health information; shared decision-making, and greater integration of different technical service areas.From this study, the social innovation brought about key institutional and socio-cultural changes in the Malawi health system. These changes supported strengthening the system’s integrity for achieving Universal Health Coverage by unlocking and cultivating dormant human-based resources. As a fully institutionalized social innovation, Chipatala Cha Pa Foni has enhanced access to primary care and especially as part of the Covid-19 response.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","547","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Set within the context of the international tertiary education industry of Australia, the original contribution stems from identifying that guidance towards an international study experience is affected by confidence in; guidance counselors, the brand name of the university, and the tertiary education decision itself. The identified confidence characteristics in this study have an inverse relationship with the length of time taken for the students' decision-making process.

The intervention comprises 30 daily interactions to be completed in less than 45 days. We will collect self-reports regarding mood, agitation, anhedonia (proximal outcomes; first objective), self-reports regarding depression severity (primary distal outcome; second and third objective), anxiety severity (secondary distal outcome; second and third objective), stress (secondary distal outcome; second and third objective), voice, and breathing.

STEM assets connected to universities may play an important role in such ecosystems. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature relating to the effect of university STEM assets on regional economies and innovation ecosystems, providing a better understanding of how the impact is generated and constrained, as well as identifying any gaps in knowledge. METHODS: Keyword and text word searches using the Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), Econlit (EBSCO) and ERIC (EBSCO) were performed in July 2021 and February 2023. Papers were double screened on abstract and title, and were included if there was consensus that they fulfilled the inclusion criteria of: (i) relating to an OECD country; (ii) having been published between 1 January 2010 and 28 February 2023; and (iii) concerning the impact of STEM assets. Data extraction was undertaken for each article by a single reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and outcome measures used, it was not possible to perform a quantitative synthesis of results. A narrative synthesis was subsequently undertaken. RESULTS: Of the 162 articles identified for detailed review, 34 were accepted as being sufficiently relevant to the study to be included for final analysis. Three important features identified were that the literature: i) is predominately concerned with supporting new businesses; ii) describes a high level of involvement with a university in providing that support; and iii studies economic impacts at local, regional and national levels. DISCUSSION: The evidence points to a gap in the literature relating to looking at the broader impact of STEM assets and any corresponding transformational, system-level effects that go beyond narrowly defined, short to medium-term outcomes. The main limitation of this review is that information on STEM assets in the non-academic literature is not captured.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","e0287005","","6","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are still countries that are recording high entrepreneurial intention levels in comparison to their corresponding entrepreneurial action levels that are low. This is a global concern to which South Africa (SA) is also not immune. Most of the research tests the relationship between two single constructs: EI and EA. Our study follows a process approach and investigates the effect of this relationship between EI and the three stages of EA. A quantitative method was employed and a survey utilized whereby data was collected among 597 entrepreneurs in South Africa. The data was analyzed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The EI construct is supported through the Theory of Planned Behavior, in conjunction with the Motivation Opportunity Ability theory. The Discovery Theory, together with the Creative Theory, supports each of the stages of EA, namely: entrepreneurial opportunity discovery (EODI); entrepreneurial opportunity evaluation (EOEV); and entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation (EOEX). Previous research regarding the relationship between EI and EA measured this relationship from a binary point of view. This study contributes to the entrepreneurship field by employing the process approach to determine the impact of EI on the stages of EA. This study reveals that EI is statistically significant in all three stages of EA. However, the strength of this relationship is found to be strong between EI and the EODI and EOEV stages and moderate between EI and the EOEX stage. Therefore, this study reveals that effective training interventions and development are necessary between EI and the EOEX stage of EA.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","1184390","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If we had a better understanding of the intricacies of the domain, we might be better equipped to navigate the ever-changing demands we must address. To that end, we explore medical education as a world wherein leaders harness agency, improvisation, discourse, positionality and power to act. METHODS: Using the constructivist theory of figured worlds (FW), we conducted a narrative analysis of the stories medical education senior leaders tell about their roles and experiences in the world of medical education (n = 9). RESULTS: We identified four foundational premises about the world of medical education: (i) medical education stands at the intersection of three interrelated worlds of clinical medicine, hospital administration and university administration; (ii) medical education is shaped by and shapes the clinical learning environment at the local level; (iii) medical education experiences ubiquitous change which is a source of power; and (iv) medical education is energised by relationships between individuals. DISCUSSION: Focusing on the FW theory's notions of agency, improvisation, discourse, positionality and power enabled us to describe the world of medical education as a complex domain existing in a space of conflicting power hierarchies, identities and discourses. Using FW allowed us to see the powerful affordances offered to medical education due to its position between worlds amid unceasing change.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:06","2025-07-26 09:59:06","","225-234","","2","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Data was collected from 703 participants 6 months after the full-scale invasion using a structured questionnaire that included sections on socio-demographic information, trauma-related issues, and mental health. Results: The study found that levels of depression and anxiety were relatively low, while stress and resilience were relatively high among Ukrainians affected by the war. However, those who were directly exposed to military actions, physical violence, or severe human suffering had higher levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and trauma-related symptoms. The war experience varied by gender, age, and living conditions. Participants who stayed in Ukraine had significantly lower anxiety, depression, stress, and trauma-related symptoms compared to those who moved abroad. Anxiety, depression, stress, low resilience, and subjective satisfaction with living conditions were predictors of trauma-related symptoms, including PTSD and CPTSD. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the mental health of Ukrainians affected by the war was impacted differently depending on their level of exposure to violence and their living conditions. Additionally, the study identified several predictors of trauma-related symptoms, including PTSD and CPTSD, such as anxiety, depression, stress, low resilience, and subjective satisfaction with living conditions.

While evidence for the effects of interventions on personality trait change is increasing, it is unclear whether these lead to subsequent improvements in the satisfaction with various domains of life. In this study, we examined the effects of a 3-month digital-coaching personality change intervention study on 10 domains of satisfaction. We focused on the three largest intervention groups of the study (<i>N</i> = 418), which included participants who wanted to increase their Emotional Stability, Conscientiousness, or Extraversion. Bivariate latent change score models were used to examine correlated change between the targeted personality traits and satisfaction domains. We found that global life satisfaction and satisfaction with oneself as a person increased in all three intervention groups. In addition, increases in specific satisfaction domains were reported for the Conscientiousness (e.g., work/school, health, friendships) and Emotional Stability (e.g., family, sexual relationships, emotions) group. Increases were stable up to the 3-month follow-up. In contrast, the waitlist control group did not report any changes in global or domain-specific life satisfaction. Changes in the satisfaction domains were positively correlated with self-reported personality trait change to a similar degree as the cross-sectional associations, but not to observer-reported personality trait change. The personality intervention thus seemed to have a positive effect on satisfaction with various domains of life, which was associated with the degree of self-reported personality trait change.

Methods: The Elena+ app functions as a single-arm interventional study, with participants recruited predominantly via social media. We used paired samples <i>T</i>-tests and within subjects ANOVA to examine changes in health outcome assessments and user experience evaluations over time. To investigate the mediating role of behavioral activation (i.e., users setting behavioral intentions and reporting actual behaviors) we use mixed-effect regression models. Free-text entries were analyzed qualitatively. Results: Results show strong demand for publicly available lifestyle coaching during the pandemic, with total downloads (<i>N</i> = 7'135) and 55.8% of downloaders opening the app (<i>n</i> = 3,928) with 9.8% completing at least one subtopic (<i>n</i> = 698). Greatest areas of health vulnerability as assessed with screening measures were physical activity with 62% (<i>n</i> = 1,000) and anxiety with 46.5% (<i>n</i> = 760). The app was effective in the treatment of mental health; with a significant decrease in depression between first (14 days), second (28 days), and third (42 days) assessments: F<sub>2,38</sub> = 7.01, <i>p</i> = 0.003, with a large effect size (η2G = 0.14), and anxiety between first and second assessments: t<sub>54</sub> = 3.7, <i>p</i> = &lt;0.001 with a medium effect size (Cohen <i>d</i> = 0.499). Those that followed the coaching program increased in net promoter score between the first and second assessment: t<sub>36</sub> = 2.08, <i>p</i> = 0.045 with a small to medium effect size (Cohen <i>d</i> = 0.342). Mediation analyses showed that while increasing number of subtopics completed increased behavioral activation (i.e., match between behavioral intentions and self-reported actual behaviors), behavioral activation did not mediate the relationship to improvements in health outcome assessments. Conclusions: Findings show that: (i) there is public demand for chatbot led digital coaching, (ii) such tools can be effective in delivering treatment success, and (iii) they are highly valued by their long-term user base. As the current intervention was developed at rapid speed to meet the emergency pandemic context, the future looks bright for other public health focused chatbot-led digital health interventions.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:07","2025-07-26 09:59:07","","1185702","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research employs joint patents as a source to measure the university-industry collaborations and statistical methods to empirically examine the impact of these collaborations on Spin-Off creation. The study is based on data from 108 universities between the years 2014 and 2017. The findings of this study reveal that both the number of collaborations and specially the presence of previous collaborations between the university and industry have a positive effect on the creation of Spin-Offs.

PURPOSE: This narrative umbrella review aimed to identify the most effective behavior change techniques (BCTs) in DHIs that address the prevention or management of NCDs. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for articles published in English between January 2007 and December 2022. Studies were included if they were systematic reviews or meta-analyses of DHIs targeting the modification of one or more NCD-related risk factors in adults. BCTs were coded using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy v1. Study quality was assessed using AMSTAR 2. RESULTS: Eighty-five articles, spanning 12 health domains and comprising over 865,000 individual participants, were included in the review. We found evidence that DHIs are effective in improving health outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and asthma, and health-related behaviors including physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet, weight management, medication adherence, and abstinence from substance use. There was strong evidence to suggest that credible source, social support, prompts and cues, graded tasks, goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, human coaching and personalization components increase the effectiveness of DHIs targeting the prevention and management of NCDs. CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies the most common and effective BCTs used in DHIs, which warrant prioritization for integration into future interventions. These findings are critical for the future development and upscaling of DHIs and should inform best practice guidelines.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:07","2025-07-26 09:59:07","","817-835","","10","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These ideals are often embraced in theory but are difficult to put into practice. As problems and solutions are related, understanding and refining theory on practical problems can close the knowing-doing gap and link the problem to the development of possible solutions. OBJECTIVE: To explore the challenges with providing physiotherapy as part of collaborative and person-centered rehabilitation services. METHODS: This article reports on an all-day interactive workshop with eight focus group discussions where physiotherapists from six different professional settings participated. We draw on theories of institutional logics to interpret the results. RESULTS: Challenges were linked to: 1) Professional level: Services being based on what the profession can offer - not on users' needs; 2) Organizational level: Rewarding efficiency instead of user outcomes; and 3) System level: Not knowing the other service providers involved or what they are doing. CONCLUSION: An innovative practice was constrained by multilevel social systems: the professional logic shaping the perceived professional scope, the organizational logic shaping the understanding of what was expected in the organizational context, and a system logic within a biomedical paradigm. Transforming and transcending these social systems is needed to realize collaborative and person-centered practice.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:07","2025-07-26 09:59:07","","2563-2578","","11","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing the uptake of deposit contract financial incentives for physical activity: A randomized controlled trial","Psychology of Sport and Exercise","","","10.1016/j.psychsport.2023.102532","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163944536","BACKGROUND: Financial incentives are a promising tool to help people increase their physical activity, but they are expensive to provide. Deposit contracts are a type of financial incentive in which participants pledge their own money. However, low uptake is a crucial obstacle to the large-scale implementation of deposit contracts. Therefore, we investigated whether (1) matching the deposit 1:1 (doubling what is deposited) and (2) allowing for customizable deposit amounts increased the uptake and short term effectiveness of a deposit contract for physical activity. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 137 healthy students (age M = 21.6 years) downloaded a smartphone app that provided them with a tailored step goal and then randomized them to one of four experimental conditions. The deposit contract required either a €10 fixed deposit or a customizable deposit with any amount between €1 and €20 upfront. Furthermore, the deposit was either not matched or 1:1 matched (doubled) with a reward provided by the experiment. During 20 intervention days, daily feedback on goal progress and incentive earnings was provided by the app. We investigated effects on the uptake (measured as agreeing to participate and paying the deposit) and effectiveness of behavioral adoption (measured as participant days goal achieved). FINDINGS: Overall, the uptake of deposit contracts was 83.2%, and participants (n = 113) achieved 14.9 out of 20 daily step goals. A binary logistic regression showed that uptake odds were 4.08 times higher when a deposit was matched (p = .010) compared to when it was not matched. Furthermore, uptake odds were 3.53 times higher when a deposit was customizable (p = .022) compared to when it was fixed. Two-way ANCOVA showed that matching (p = .752) and customization (p = .143) did not impact intervention effectiveness. However, we did find a marginally significant interaction effect of deposit matching X deposit customization (p = .063, ηp2 = 0.032). Customization decreased effectiveness when deposits were not matched (p = .033, ηp2 = 0.089), but had no effect when deposits were matched (p = .776, ηp2 = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first experimental evidence that both matching and customization increase the uptake of a deposit contract for physical activity. We recommend considering both matching and customization to overcome lack of uptake, with a preference for customization since matching a deposit imposes significant additional costs. However, since we found indications that customizable deposits might reduce effectiveness (when the deposits are not matched), we urge for more research on the effectiveness of customizable deposit contracts. Finally, future research should investigate which participant characteristics are predictive of deposit contract uptake and effectiveness.

Patient’s limbs were visually scored for bruises and hematomas, and Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using EQ5D-3L and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaires. At week 0, the used hemodialyzer was scanned in a micro-CT scanner to quantify the number of patent fibers.

Patients in the highest tertile of anticoagulation dose had a worse VAS score (p = 0.027), and patients identified as having bleeding tendency by ISTH also had a worse VAS score (p = 0.010).

Based on topic modeling and sentiment analysis, we provide an overview of global perceptions and reactions to ChatGPT regarding education. ChatGPT triggered a massive response on Twitter, with education being the most tweeted content topic. Topics ranged from specific (e.g., cheating) to broad (e.g., opportunities), which were discussed with mixed sentiment. We traced that authority decisions may influence public opinions. We discussed that the average reaction on Twitter (e.g., using ChatGPT to cheat in exams) differs from discussions in which education and teaching–learning researchers are likely to be more interested (e.g., ChatGPT as an intelligent learning partner).

We previously performed a literature review to develop a ROI conceptual framework for QI programmes. We concluded that, QI-ROI is conceptualised as any monetary and non-monetary benefit. In the current study, we explored if this finding is shared by mental healthcare leaders. We also investigated the stability of this conceptualisation against influencing factors and potential for disinvestment.MethodsWe performed qualitative interviews with leaders in an NHS mental health organisation. There were 16 participants: nine board members and seven senior leaders. The interviews were held online via Microsoft Teams and lasted an hour on average. We performed deductive-inductive analysis to seek data from our initial ROI framework and any new data.ResultsWe found that in mental healthcare, QI-ROI is also conceptualised as any valued monetary and non-monetary benefits. There was a strong emphasis on benefits to external partners and a de-emphasis of benefit monetisation. This conceptualisation was influenced by the 1) perceived mandates to improve quality and manage scarce resources, 2) expectations from QI, 3) health and social care values, 4) ambiguity over expectations, and 5) uncertainty over outcomes. Uncertainty, ambiguity, and potential for disinvestment posed a threat to the stability of this conceptualisation but did not ultimately change it. Health and social care values supported maintaining the QI-ROI as any benefit, with a focus on patients and staff outcomes. Socio-political desires to improve quality were strong drivers for QI investment.ConclusionMental healthcare leaders primarily conceptualise QI-ROI as any valued benefit. The inclusion of externalised outcomes which are hard to attribute may be challenging. However, mental healthcare services do collaborate with external partners. The de-emphases of benefit monetisation may also be controversial due to the need for financial accountability. Mental healthcare leaders recognise the importance of efficiency savings. However, they raised concerns over the legitimacy and utility of traditional ROI as a tool for assessing QI value. Further research is needed to bring more clarity on these aspects of the QI-ROI concept.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:07","2025-07-26 09:59:07","","1009","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following an informed grounded theory approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 38 Indonesian prisoners who have been convicted of corruption. Guided by a multi-step decision-making process, including problem recognition, information search, and evaluation of the information, our results revealed unique insights into individuals' considerations that led to corruption.

Our study aims to explore how DRC initiatives can be integrated in large-scale digital infrastructures. Our in-depth case study, which explores 72 different DRC trajectories at 9 hospital health trusts in Norway, reveals the dynamic interplay among 3 key mechanisms - idealistic entrepreneurship, anchoring and remote infrastructure. Our contribution to the DIN literature is a model that shows the interplay among these key mechanisms, which increases the innovation pace, improves the innovations' scalability and provides a robust organisation that constantly implements innovations. As a contributions to DRC practice, lessons learned to speed up the innovation pace are offered: (1) Create a DRC organisational structure. (2) Ensure financial predictability.

Too much focus on the medical side and one's own vulnerability and mortality might be counterproductive and not doing justice to the complexity of human nature. Unlike cytotoxic and lympho-depleting treatments, immune-engaging therapies strengthen the immune system and are typically less harmful for patients. Thus, cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors are not viewed as being vulnerable <i>per se</i>, at least not in immunological and physical terms. This perspective article advocates a holistic approach to cancer immunotherapy, with an empowered patient in the center, focusing on personal resources and receiving domain-specific support from healthcare professionals. It summarizes recent evidence on non-pharmaceutical interventions to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and improve quality of life. These interventions target behavioral factors such as diet, physical activity, stress management, circadian timing of checkpoint inhibitor infusion, and waiving unnecessary co-medication curtailing immunotherapy efficacy. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are universally accessible, broadly applicable, instantly actionable, scalable, and economically sustainable, creating value for all stakeholders involved. Most importantly, this holistic framework re-emphasizes the patient as a whole and harnesses the full potential of anticancer immunity and checkpoint blockade, potentially leading to survival benefits. Digital therapeutics are proposed to accompany the patients on their mission toward change in lifestyle-related behaviors for creating optimal conditions for treatment efficacy and personal growth.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:08","2025-07-26 09:59:08","","2255459","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chronic disease self-management aims to prevent or delay disease progression and disability and reduce mortality risk. The evidence to support the use of information technology tools, including mobile apps, web-based portals, and web-based educational interventions, that support disease self-management and improve clinical outcomes is growing. Customer discovery and value proposition design methodology is a form of stakeholder engagement and is based on marketing and lean start-up business methods. As applied in health care, customer discovery and value proposition methodology can be used to understand the clinical problem and articulate the product's hypothesized unique value proposition relative to alternative options that are available to end users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the experience and findings of academic researchers applying the customer discovery and value proposition methodology to identify stakeholders, needs, adaptability, and sustainability of a chronic disease self-management mobile app (CDapp). The motivation of the work is to make mobile health app interventions accessible and acceptable for all segments of patients' chronic diseases. METHODS: Data were obtained through key informant interviews and analyzed using rapid qualitative analysis techniques. The value proposition framework was used to build the interview guide. The aim was to identify the needs, challenges (pains), and potential benefits (gains) of the CDapp for our stakeholders. RESULTS: Our results showed that the primary consumers (end users) of a CDapp were the patients. The app adopters (decision makers) can be medical center leaders including population health department managers or insurance providers, while the consumer adoption influencers (influencers or saboteurs) are clinicians and patient caregivers. We developed an ecosystem map to visualize the clinical practice workflow and how an app for chronic disease management might integrate within an academic health care center or system. A value proposition for the identified customer segments was generated. Each stakeholder segment was working within a different framework to improve patient self-management. Patients needed help to adhere to self-care activities and they needed tailored health education. Health care leaders aim to improve the quality of care while reducing costs and workload. Clinicians wanted to improve patient education and care while reducing the time burden. Our results also showed that within academic medical centers, there were variations regarding patients' self-reported abilities to manage their diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Customer discovery is a useful form of stakeholder engagement when designing studies that seek to implement, adapt, and sustain an intervention. The customer discovery and value proposition methodology can be used as an alternative or complementary approach to formative research to generate valuable information in a brief period.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:08","2025-07-26 09:59:08","","e50334","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abundant research exists on academic entrepreneurs in the United Sates (USA) and Europe. Limited research exists on understanding pathways of academic entrepreneurship in South African Universities. Aim: The aim was to critically review the pathway of research commercialisation of academics at a research-intensive university. Setting: This single case study focuses on one research-intensive university; a pioneer in the field of academic entrepreneurship in South Africa. Methods: A qualitative research approach following a single-case study design was selected to investigate a phenomenon within its natural setting, using purposeful sampling and semi-structured interviews. The data were thematically analysed. Results: The nature of research outputs takes a hybrid form, the awareness of the commercialisation of research is ineffectively communicated, supporting mechanisms Technology Transfer Office (TTO) are in place, factors hampering research commercialisation include time constraints and academics’ willingness to partner with the university. Conclusion: Context is bi-modal, meaning the institution is orientated towards basic research, Mode 1, while there is a transition of the research culture towards commercialisation of research, Mode 2, contributing to ineffective communication within the institution. Commercialisation extends the life cycle of research, and the recognition for publication in ranking metrics contributes to tension between commercialisation and publication of research.

The concept was intended to be lofty, to reflect a new ""bench-to-bedside"" approach to basic and clinical research that would bridge fields, close gaps, accelerate innovation, and shorten the time and effort it takes to bring novel technologies from basic discovery to clinical application. Has this approach been successful and lived up to its promise? Despite incredible scientific advances and innovations developed within academia, successful clinical translation into real-world solutions has been difficult. This has been particularly challenging within the pulmonary field, because there have been fewer U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and higher failure rates for pulmonary therapies than with other common disease areas. The American Thoracic Society convened a working group with the goal of identifying major challenges related to the commercialization of technologies within the pulmonary space and opportunities to enhance this process. A survey was developed and administered to 164 participants within the pulmonary arena. This report provides a summary of these survey results. Importantly, this report identifies a number of poorly recognized challenges that exist in pulmonary academic settings, which likely contribute to diminished efficiency of commercialization efforts, ultimately hindering the rate of successful clinical translation. Because many innovations are initially developed in academic settings, this is a global public health issue that impacts the entire American Thoracic Society community. This report also summarizes key resources and opportunities and provides recommendations to enhance successful commercialization of pulmonary technologies.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:08","2025-07-26 09:59:08","","1-11","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the growing body of literature presents a range of terms, concepts, and definitions related to MSPs, potentially causing confusion and obscuring the distinctions between different types of partnerships. While the potential benefits of MSPs have been extensively explored in the literature, there remains a need to investigate their realized impacts across regions to enable a more robust synthesis. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on MSPs in agricultural development, specifically examining the various concepts employed and assessing their realized impacts on farmers, focusing on developing countries. METHODS We systematically reviewed the literature on MSPs and identified 147 studies dealing with a different type of MSPs and 79 studies reporting the impact. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We found that twelve terms have been used to describe MSPs. However, a single MSP initiative may be referred to by different names in various documents, indicating a lack of consensus on the defining characteristics of such partnerships. Positive impacts were reported on farmers' economic, social, and technological aspects, as well as environmental adaptation practices to address climate change. Nevertheless, the reported impacts tend to focus primarily on economic, technological, and social dimensions while giving less attention to environmental aspects. SIGNIFICANCE This paper presents, firstly, a comprehensive overview of the diverse practices of MSPs in developing countries. Secondly, it analyses the contributions made by MSPs across various commodities and regions in the development of agricultural value chains.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:08","2025-07-26 09:59:08","","103792","","","213","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Holistic mobile health (mHealth) interventions-including at least three components: physical activity, diet, and mental health-could support both physical and mental health and be scaled to the population level. This review aims to describe the characteristics of holistic mHealth interventions and their effects on related behavioural and health outcomes among adults from the general population. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Google Scholar (first 200 records). The initial search covered January 1, 2011, to April 13, 2022, and an updated search extended from April 13, 2022 to August 30, 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) were included if they (i) were delivered via mHealth technologies, (ii) included content on physical activity, diet, and mental health, and (iii) targeted adults (≥18 years old) from the general population or those at risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or mental disorders. Studies were excluded if they targeted pregnant women (due to distinct physiological responses), individuals with pre-existing NCDs or mental disorders (to emphasise prevention), or primarily utilised web, email, or structured phone support (to focus on mobile technologies without exclusive human support). Data (summary data from published reports) extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were completed by two reviewers using a standard template and Cochrane risk-of-bias tools, respectively. Narrative syntheses were conducted for all studies, and random-effects models were used in the meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect of interventions for outcomes with comparable data in the RCTs. The study was registered in PROSPERO, CRD42022315166. Findings: After screening 5488 identified records, 34 studies (25 RCTs and 9 pre-post NRSIs) reported in 43 articles with 5691 participants (mean age 39 years, SD 12.5) were included. Most (91.2%, n = 31/34) were conducted in high-income countries. The median intervention duration was 3 months, and only 23.5% (n = 8/34) of studies reported follow-up data. Mobile applications, short-message services, and mobile device-compatible websites were the most common mHealth delivery modes; 47.1% (n = 16/34) studies used multiple mHealth delivery modes. Of 15 studies reporting on weight change, 9 showed significant reductions (6 targeted on individuals with overweight or obesity), and in 10 studies reporting perceived stress levels, 4 found significant reductions (all targeted on general adults). In the meta-analysis, holistic mHealth interventions were associated with significant weight loss (9 RCTs; mean difference -1.70 kg, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.95; I<sup>2</sup> = 89.00%) and a significant reduction in perceived stress levels (6 RCTs; standardised mean difference [SMD] -0.32; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.12; I<sup>2</sup> = 14.52%). There were no significant intervention effects on self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (5 RCTs; SMD 0.21; 95%CI -0.25 to 0.67; I<sup>2</sup> = 74.28%) or diet quality scores (5 RCTs; SMD 0.21; 95%CI -0.47 to 0.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 62.27%). All NRSIs were labelled as having a serious risk of bias overall; 56% (n = 14/25) of RCTs were classified as having some concerns, and the others as having a high risk of bias. Interpretation: Findings from identified studies suggest that holistic mHealth interventions may aid reductions in weight and in perceived stress levels, with small to medium effect sizes. The observed effects on diet quality scores and self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were less clear and require more research. High-quality RCTs with longer follow-up durations are needed to provide more robust evidence. To promote population health, future research should focus on vulnerable populations and those in middle- and low-income countries. Optimal combinations of delivery modes and components to improve efficacy and sustain long-term effects should also be explored.

This paper introduces a patient-specific phantom designed for PSF training, extending a portion of the learning process beyond the confines of the surgical room. Six phantoms of the thoracolumbar region were fabricated from radiological datasets, combining 3D printing and casting techniques. The phantoms were employed in three training sessions by a fifth-year resident who performed full training on all six phantoms; he/she placed a total of 57 pedicle screws. Analysis of the learning curve, focusing on time per screw and positioning accuracy, revealed attainment of an asymptotic performance level (around 3 min per screw) after 40 screws. The phantom's efficacy was evaluated by three experts and six residents, each inserting a minimum of four screws. Initial assessments confirmed face, content, and construct validity, affirming the patient-specific phantoms as a valuable training resource. These proposed phantoms exhibit great promise as an essential tool in surgical training as they exhibited a demonstrable learning effect on the PSF technique. This study lays the foundation for further exploration and underscores the potential impact of these patient-specific phantoms on the future of spinal surgical education.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:08","2025-07-26 09:59:08","","1345","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, hypoglycemia can be detected and signaled through flash glucose monitoring or continuous glucose monitoring devices, which require manual and visual interaction, thereby removing the focus of attention from the driving task. Hypoglycemia causes a decrease in attention, thereby challenging the safety of using such devices behind the wheel. Here, we present an investigation of a hands-free technology-a voice warning that can potentially be delivered via an in-vehicle voice assistant. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of an in-vehicle voice warning for hypoglycemia, evaluating both its effectiveness and user perception. METHODS: We designed a voice warning and evaluated it in 3 studies. In all studies, participants received a voice warning while driving. Study 0 (n=10) assessed the feasibility of using a voice warning with healthy participants driving in a simulator. Study 1 (n=18) assessed the voice warning in participants with T1DM. Study 2 (n=20) assessed the voice warning in participants with T1DM undergoing hypoglycemia while driving in a real car. We measured participants' self-reported perception of the voice warning (with a user experience scale in study 0 and with acceptance, alliance, and trust scales in studies 1 and 2) and compliance behavior (whether they stopped the car and reaction time). In addition, we assessed technology affinity and collected the participants' verbal feedback. RESULTS: Technology affinity was similar across studies and approximately 70% of the maximal value. Perception measure of the voice warning was approximately 62% to 78% in the simulated driving and 34% to 56% in real-world driving. Perception correlated with technology affinity on specific constructs (eg, Affinity for Technology Interaction score and intention to use, optimism and performance expectancy, behavioral intention, Session Alliance Inventory score, innovativeness and hedonic motivation, and negative correlations between discomfort and behavioral intention and discomfort and competence trust; all P<.05). Compliance was 100% in all studies, whereas reaction time was higher in study 1 (mean 23, SD 5.2 seconds) than in study 0 (mean 12.6, SD 5.7 seconds) and study 2 (mean 14.6, SD 4.3 seconds). Finally, verbal feedback showed that the participants preferred the voice warning to be less verbose and interactive. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the feasibility of an in-vehicle voice warning for hypoglycemia. Drivers find such an implementation useful and effective in a simulated environment, but improvements are needed in the real-world driving context. This study is a kickoff for the use of in-vehicle voice assistants for digital health interventions.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:08","2025-07-26 09:59:08","","e42823","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the key components of treatment are behavior interventions such as lifestyle modification. Scalable conversational agents (CAs) have the potential to deliver behavior interventions at a low threshold. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of behavioral interventions delivered by CAs for the treatment of headaches. OBJECTIVE: This study has 2 aims. The first aim was to develop and test a smartphone-based coaching intervention (BalanceUP) for people experiencing frequent headaches, delivered by a CA and designed to improve mental well-being using various behavior change techniques. The second aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of BalanceUP by comparing the intervention and waitlist control groups and assess the engagement and acceptance of participants using BalanceUP. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, adults with frequent headaches were recruited on the web and in collaboration with experts and allocated to either a CA intervention (BalanceUP) or a control condition. The effects of the treatment on changes in the primary outcome of the study, that is, mental well-being (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale), and secondary outcomes (eg, psychosomatic symptoms, stress, headache-related self-efficacy, intention to change behavior, presenteeism and absenteeism, and pain coping) were analyzed using linear mixed models and Cohen d. Primary and secondary outcomes were self-assessed before and after the intervention, and acceptance was assessed after the intervention. Engagement was measured during the intervention using self-reports and usage data. RESULTS: A total of 198 participants (mean age 38.7, SD 12.14 y; n=172, 86.9% women) participated in the study (intervention group: n=110; waitlist control group: n=88). After the intervention, the intention-to-treat analysis revealed evidence for improved well-being (treatment: β estimate=-3.28, 95% CI -5.07 to -1.48) with moderate between-group effects (Cohen d=-0.66, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.33) in favor of the intervention group. We also found evidence of reduced somatic symptoms, perceived stress, and absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as improved headache management self-efficacy, application of behavior change techniques, and pain coping skills, with effects ranging from medium to large (Cohen d=0.43-1.05). Overall, 64.8% (118/182) of the participants used coaching as intended by engaging throughout the coaching and completing the outro. CONCLUSIONS: BalanceUP was well accepted, and the results suggest that coaching delivered by a CA can be effective in reducing the burden of people who experience headaches by improving their well-being.

Currently, companies cannot develop and commercialize all technologies. Therefore, the importance of technology transfers is rapidly increasing. Technology transfer is a crucial strategy adopted by organizations to remain innovative and competitive. However, Korea's technology transfer rate is only 37.9%. In particular, the technology transfer rate from universities to companies is lower than that from government-funded research institutes in Korea. Although the fundamental approach for resolving barriers to technology transfer have been studied, previous research has been conducted from a narrow definition of technology transfer. Furthermore, previous research has focused on analyzing the success factors of technology transfer, presenting technology transfer processes, or conducting case studies. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a technology donor diagnosis framework based on CSFs (Critical Success Factors) to eliminate obstacles to technology transfers. To lower the barriers to technology transfers, it is necessary to develop a strategy for a successful technology transfer based on the diagnosis of technology donors. This study develops a diagnosis framework for universities from the perspective of technology donors, implements and tests the framework using case studies, and proposes strategies for each stage of technology transfer growth. The framework is able to assess multidimensional perspectives, because CSFs and PMs were extracted based on BSC. Furthermore, by comparing the perspectives score of technology donors in different universities, technology donors can identify the areas in which each university is lacking in its current situation. Multidimensional diagnosis and aggregation score of technology donors offer to extract optimal CSFs for technology transfer activation for each growth stage.","2023","2025-07-26 09:59:08","2025-07-26 09:59:08","","e0293951","","12","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to understand how these technologies can be utilised for people living with dementia, their impacts must first be reviewed. Currently, there is limited literature available on the topic, usually only focusing on a particular kind of digital assistive technology. Therefore, this paper presents a protocol for a scoping review that aims to provide a general overview of the impact digital assistive technologies can have on the quality of life for people living with dementia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will follow the scoping review framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. A comprehensive search will be performed to identify original research articles or clinical trials published between 2013 and 2023 across five online databases (Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science). The review will encompass both qualitative and quantitative themes derived from the literature. Relevant studies will be identified through a comprehensive search using specific search terms related to the population (people with dementia), intervention (digital assistive technologies) and outcome (quality of life). The screening of titles, abstracts and full texts will be performed to select eligible studies based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data will be extracted using a standardised form, and the findings will be synthesised and reported qualitatively and quantitatively.

We draw on the works on ethics of the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur ̶ one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century ̶ to provide an answer which encompasses but also goes beyond the association of ethics solely with ‘good’ purposes or ‘right’ norms to value it in each situation by paying special attention to how academic entrepreneurs behave in their relationships with others. We conclude that it is the manner and quality of open, generous, meaningful and appropriate ‘self-regulation’ that defines academic entrepreneurs as ethical individuals.

This research sought to explore the tacit meanings of ""lifecycle"" and ""lifecycle evaluation"" as embodied within evaluation models/frameworks used for medical devices. METHODS: Drawing on qualitative evidence synthesis methods and using an inductive approach, novel methods were developed to identify, appraise, analyze, and synthesize lifecycle evaluation models used for medical devices. Data was extracted (including purpose; audience; characterization; outputs; timing; and type of model) from key texts for coding, categorization, and comparison, exploring embodied meaning across four broad perspectives. RESULTS: Fifty-two models were included in the synthesis. They demonstrated significant heterogeneity of meaning, form, scope, timing, and purpose. The ""lifecycle"" may represent a single stage, a series of stages, a cycle of innovation, or a system. ""Lifecycle evaluation"" focuses on the overarching goal of the stakeholder group, and may use a single or repeated evaluation to inform decision-making regarding the adoption of health technologies (Healthcare), resource allocation (Policymaking), investment in new product development or marketing (Trade and Industry), or market regulation (Regulation). The adoption of a lifecycle approach by regulators has resulted in the deferral of evidence generation to the post-market phase. CONCLUSIONS: Using a ""lifecycle evaluation"" approach to inform reimbursement decision-making must not be allowed to further jeopardize evidence generation and patient safety by accepting inadequate evidence of safety and effectiveness for reimbursement decisions.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:09","2025-07-26 09:59:09","","e2","","1","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Co-occurrence analysis visualizes the clusters of the most prominent components in both general and rural entrepreneurial ecosystems. We interpret the results based on a literature review. Our study categorizes the essential components into two: actor (academics, business, government, and community) and non-actor (human capital, network, entrepreneurial culture, financial systems, governance systems, infrastructure, environmental resources, and market) components. Environmental resources are critical in distinguishing the conditions of an entrepreneurial ecosystem in rural areas. This component represents the uniqueness and local economic potential of smaller areas, whereas in general entrepreneurial ecosystem studies, this component might not be a concern.

Academic entrepreneurship, as a direct channel for knowledge dissemination into the marketplace, is significantly influenced by digital technology. Consequently, how to improve academic entrepreneurial ability has become a hot research topic. This study is grounded in the theory of reciprocal determinism within the context of the digital economy. We use the ""2019 China Digital Economy Development Index White Paper"" and collect data from 1843 survey questionnaires in China to conduct empirical research with a ridge regression model. It primarily focuses on the following individual factors and social environmental factors on academic entrepreneurial ability of teachers (AEAT): digital economy (DE), organizational support (OS), policy environment (PE), and personal learning growth (PLG). First, the findings show that the DE, OS, PE, and PLG have a significant positive impact on improving AEAT. Second, the results also indicate that social environmental factors relative to personal factors will have a greater impact. Finally, this study not only presents the first attempt to establish a connection between DE and AEAT but also holds significant managerial implications for enhancing AEAT within the context of the DE. Despite the increasing body of literature on academic entrepreneurship, the research domain pertaining specifically to AEAT remains fragmented and lacks comprehensive theoretical development. There is a pressing need for more systematic and thorough investigations to unveil the black box of factors influencing AEAT in the context of the DE.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:09","2025-07-26 09:59:09","","e24152","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BPSD are an extreme source of stress for family care partners and health care providers alike and can be the reason why people living with dementia (PLWD) are placed in long-term care homes (LTCH). The overall goal of this project was to examine whether a virtual environment that includes a virtual LTCH resident with dementia in a lifelike situation could be useful and usable for health care providers and care partners to identify potential triggers to BPSDs while being engaged emotionally with the scenario. Methods: Twenty-three health care professionals working with PLWD, 25 care partners to PLWD, 27 students in a health-related field, and 11 university/community college faculty members teaching courses relevant to gerontology tested the application which depicted a meal-time scenario. In addition to being asked about the behavioral triggers in the scene, participants were asked about the usefulness and usability of the tool for training. Presence and simulator sickness were also measured. Results: Results suggest that participants generally felt present and emotionally engaged. They could identify the potential triggers for the observed behaviors in the virtual human with dementia as well as suggest some solutions. The majority (87% of participants) found the tool easy to use. Many participants identified the inability to interact with the virtual humans as a shortfall, and few reported mild to moderate levels of simulator sickness. Discussion: As the behavioral changes associated with dementia can cause extreme stress for those interacting with PLWD, developing an effective and efficient training tool could significantly improve well-being for all involved. The investigators see the development and testing of an interactive version of this virtual environment as a next step in making this a clinically relevant training tool.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:09","2025-07-26 09:59:09","","1237127","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, innovation activities like research and development can be costly, and commercializing new products faces complexities. Having effective business models (BMs) aligned with such innovation activities is crucial. This study delves into the intricacies of BMs in these innovator companies, emphasizing the pivotal role of effective BMs in navigating uncertainties and fostering innovation. This study conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize knowledge on BMs in innovator health-tech companies and compare models on dimensions like infrastructure, offering, customers, and finances. The review of 34 recent papers revealed 9 key BMs - open innovation, sustainable, dynamic, dual, spin-off, frugal, high-tech entrepreneurial content marketing, back-end, and product-service systems BMs. The analysis found open innovation, sustainability, and dynamicity as foundational models that can serve as a basis when combined with others. The paper unveils a tailored Dynamic Sustainable Business Model (DSBM) for Health-Tech, designed to integrate adaptability and sustainability, providing a framework for companies to leverage emerging technologies effectively. Additionally, a conceptual framework outlining 28 groups of uncertainty factors in BMs was developed to aid risk management in health-tech.

The aim of this paper is to design an evaluation and screening system help venture capital institutions to select the qualified TSs as their investment objective. DESIGN: A research framework of four dimensions that include conception, technical innovation, business model and team structure, was built based on previous studies. Based on the research framework, 15 second-level indicators and 33 third-level indicators were extracted with literature research method. This paper proposes an evaluation model with back propagation neural network (BPNN) optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) to improve the rate of selecting and investing in qualified start-ups. FINDINGS: The results show that the evaluation accuracy of the evaluation model for qualified and unqualified enterprises can reach 80.33% and 93.67% respectively, which has verified the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper established an effective evaluation system based on PCA and GA-BPNN to help venture capital institutions preliminarily screen potential technology start-ups, which provides the possibility for venture capital institutions to greatly reduce the screening time and cost, improve the screening efficiency of TSs, and scientifically assess the risk of investee projects or investee enterprises to obtain sustainable and stable excess profits.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:09","2025-07-26 09:59:09","","e0289691","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants (<i>N</i> = 121) followed a TCA-supported app-based physical activity intervention. We manipulated two types of human cues: visual (ie, message appearance) and relational (ie, message content). We employed a 2 (visual cues: yes, no) x 2 (relational cues: yes, no) between-subjects design, resulting in four experimental groups: (1) visual and relational cues, (2) visual cues only, (3) relational cues only, or (4) no human cues.

Current research tends to concentrate either on specific categories of DATs or provide a generic view. Therefore, it is of essence to provide a review of different kinds of DATs and how they contribute to improving quality of life (QOL) for PWD. DESIGN: Scoping review using the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley and recommendations from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science (January 2013 to May 2023). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Completed scientific literature with a primary focus on DATs for PWD, perspectives of caregivers, family members or healthcare workers in relation to a PWD, people living in diverse settings and all severities of dementia. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Screening and data extraction were conducted, followed by quantitative and qualitative analyses using thematic analysis principles and Digital Therapeutics Alliance categories for DAT grouping. RESULTS: The literature search identified 6083 records, with 1056 duplicates. After screening, 4560 full texts were excluded, yielding 122 studies of different designs. The DATs were categorised into digital therapeutics (n=109), patient monitoring (n=30), digital diagnostics (n=2), care support (n=2) and health system clinical software (n=1). These categories were identified to impact various aspects of QOL: preserving autonomy, engagement, and social interaction, health monitoring and promotion, improving activities of daily living, improving cognition, maintaining dignity, managing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and safety/surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Various DATs offer extensive support, elevating the QOL of PWD. Digital therapeutics are predominantly used for ageing-in-place and independent living through assistance with daily tasks. Future research should focus on less-represented digital health technology categories, such as care support, health & wellness or software solutions. Observing ongoing DAT developments and their long-term effects on QOL remains essential.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:09","2025-07-26 09:59:09","","e080545","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this context, this article seeks to examine the effects of global environmental management and efforts to achieve this goal. Specifically, it investigates the role of democracy, control of corruption, and civil society participation as mechanisms that moderate the impact of environmental policy and legislation, particularly clean energy policy and climate change legislation (laws and regulations), on carbon emissions in highly polluted countries. The empirical results show that (i) the effects of democracy-clean energy policies and climate change legislation are relatively small in reducing carbon emissions; (ii) the effect of controlling corruption-climate change regulations is strong in reducing emissions, meaning that governments with higher control of corruption are more effective at enacting and executing laws and regulations dealing with environmental challenges which help achieve desirable environmental outcomes; (iii) strong civil society participation helps the execution of clean energy policies and climate change legislation to curb emissions, and (iv) the robustness check also provides strong evidence that higher control of corruption can contribute to the effectiveness of these policies and legislation in reducing carbon emissions. Overall, these findings suggest that the efficiency of well-designed environmental policy and legislation should be supported by a combination of higher civil society participation and greater control of corruption that can efficiently enforce such policies and legislation.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:09","2025-07-26 09:59:09","","120275","","","354","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising cell-based therapy for OA. However, there is still a need for additional randomized, dose-dependent studies to determine the optimal dose and tissue source of MSC for improved clinical outcomes. Here, we performed a dose-dependant evaluation of umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSC (Celllistem) in a murine model and in knee OA patients. For the preclinical study, a classical dose (200.000 cells) and a lower dose (50.000 cells) of Cellistem were intra-articularly injected into the mice knee joints. The results showed a dose efficacy response effect of Cellistem associated with a decreased inflammatory and degenerative response according to the Pritzker OARSI score. Following the same approach, the dose-escalation phase I clinical trial design included 3 sequential cohorts: low-dose group (2 × 106 cells), medium-dose group (20 × 106), and high-dose group (80 × 106). All the doses were safe, and no serious adverse events were reported. Nonetheless, 100% of the patients injected with the high-dose experienced injection-related swelling in the knee joint. According to WOMAC total outcomes, patients treated with all doses reported significant improvements in pain and function compared with baseline after 3 and 6 months. However, the improvements were higher in patients treated with both medium and low dose as compared to high dose. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the intra-articular injection of different doses of Cellistem is both safe and efficient, making it an interesting therapeutic alternative to treat mild and symptomatic knee OA patients.

Conducted in a Slovenian CH in 2020 and 2023, participants, including CH management, staff, and residents with their relatives, shared perceptions of knowledge transfer at various levels. The study aims to explore barriers and facilitators for knowledge transfer crucial for creating new knowledge, services, and enhancing care quality for older individuals. Methods: Structured focus group interviews were conducted, and data were collected within the CH. The participants' insights into knowledge transfer were probed, covering various dimensions such as between individuals, groups, organizations, and the community. Transcriptions of recorded interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Results: Knowledge transfer within the CH was facilitated through continuous training, diverse communication channels, and mentoring. Collaboration with relatives improved understanding of resident preferences, habits, and overall enhanced the quality of care. This collaborative effort allowed mutual learning and knowledge transfer from the CH to the broader community. Despite potential benefits, there is an underutilization of information and communication technology, e-care, and untapped potential for partnerships, partly due to the scarcity of care. Barriers were identified in the form of stereotypical attitudes towards aging and care, further reinforced by negative news coverage on older people's care. Conclusion: The multidimensional nature of knowledge in CH centers on resident well-being, emphasizing three key aspects of knowledge transfer: between staff and residents, staff and residents' families, and between the CH and the community. In the context of age management, creating opportunities for knowledge transfer is crucial, emphasizing a transition from traditional institutional care to an approach prioritizing knowledge about quality care. and involving experts from experiences in care process.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:09","2025-07-26 09:59:09","","1298833","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that this field constitutes a bridging issue field, spanning several policy domains, including education, employment and economy, and characterised by non-linear and relatively slow change. We demonstrate how the field since the mid-2000s has become elaborated via the strategic framing of teacher skills and careers as policy issues, the mobilisation of actors and networks, and an expanding institutional infrastructure of mechanisms and policy instruments.

The study adopted the method of combining qualitative research with quantitative research. After the qualitative study, we gathered examples of social burnout and finished item writing. Using convenient sampling and theoretical sampling methods, six different samples were recruited for reliability and validity testing. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed the scale's two-factor structure: emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Cronbach's alpha measured the internal consistency of the social burnout scale (SBS), which was excellent (Cronbach's alpha of emotional exhaustion = 0.94; depersonalization = 0.82; the overall = 0.92). Susequently, the method of calculating AVE and CR evaluated the scale's convergent and discriminant validity, which were relatively good (AVE of emotional exhaustion = 0.60, depersonalization = 0.59; CR of emotional exhaustion = 0.93, depersonalization = 0.81). Then, regression analysis verified the nomological network and criterion-related validity (<i>r</i> = -0.30, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; r = -0.39, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; <i>β</i> = -0.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

We conducted semistructured remote interviews with 46 individuals from 32 marine conservation foundations to identify how conservation foundations engage communities in setting their priorities and deciding which organizations and projects to fund. We found that community engagement in foundation decision-making was limited in practice. Eleven of the 32 foundations reported some form of community engagement in funding decisions. Two of these foundations empowered communities to shape funding priorities and projects through strong forms of engagement. Many engagement practices were one way, one time, or indirect and confined to certain points in decision-making processes. These weaker practices limited community input and reinforced unequal power relations, which may undermine the legitimacy, equity, and effectiveness of conservation efforts. We suggest that foundations aim for stronger forms of community engagement and reflect on how their grant-making practices affect power relations between foundations and communities.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","e14272","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through descriptive and content analysis methods, the paper develops the first framework conceptualizing Socio-Tech Entrepreneurship as an autonomous topic within the entrepreneurship research domain. Drawing on the literature, the conceptual framework shows that Socio-Tech Entrepreneurship is distinct from Social Entrepreneurship or Technology Entrepreneurship, which legitimates it as a conceptually relevant group of organizations/practices and as an autonomous research topic within the business sciences field. The paper's comprehensive assessment of the literature and the proposed conceptual framework also unveil topics that are specific to Technology or Social Entrepreneurship but have not been addressed yet for Socio-Tech Entrepreneurship, offering potential future research opportunities and contributing to a research agenda.

This study investigates the less-discussed 'shadows' of AI implementation in educational settings, focusing on potential negatives that may accompany its integration. Through a multi-phased exploration consisting of content analysis and survey research, the study develops and validates a theoretical model that pinpoints several areas of concern. The initial phase, a systematic literature review, yielded 56 relevant studies from which the model was crafted. The subsequent survey with 260 participants from a Saudi Arabian university aimed to validate the model. Findings confirm concerns about human connection, data privacy and security, algorithmic bias, transparency, critical thinking, access equity, ethical issues, teacher development, reliability, and the consequences of AI-generated content. They also highlight correlations between various AI-associated concerns, suggesting intertwined consequences rather than isolated issues. For instance, enhancements in AI transparency could simultaneously support teacher professional development and foster better student outcomes. Furthermore, the study acknowledges the transformative potential of AI but cautions against its unexamined adoption in education. It advocates for comprehensive strategies to maintain human connections, ensure data privacy and security, mitigate biases, enhance system transparency, foster creativity, reduce access disparities, emphasize ethics, prepare teachers, ensure system reliability, and regulate AI-generated content. Such strategies underscore the need for holistic policymaking to leverage AI's benefits while safeguarding against its disadvantages.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","e30696","","9","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to stigma and symptom underestimation, students rarely seek effective stress management solutions. Conversational agents in the health sector have shown promise in reducing stress, depression, and anxiety. Nevertheless, research on their effectiveness for students with stress remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a conversational agent-delivered stress management coaching intervention for students called MISHA and to evaluate its effectiveness, engagement, and acceptance. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, Swiss students experiencing stress were recruited on the web. Using a 1:1 randomization ratio, participants (N=140) were allocated to either the intervention or waitlist control group. Treatment effectiveness on changes in the primary outcome, that is, perceived stress, and secondary outcomes, including depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, and active coping, were self-assessed and evaluated using ANOVA for repeated measure and general estimating equations. RESULTS: The per-protocol analysis revealed evidence for improvement of stress, depression, and somatic symptoms with medium effect sizes (Cohen d=-0.36 to Cohen d=-0.60), while anxiety and active coping did not change (Cohen d=-0.29 and Cohen d=0.13). In the intention-to-treat analysis, similar results were found, indicating reduced stress (β estimate=-0.13, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.05; P<.001), depressive symptoms (β estimate=-0.23, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.08; P=.003), and psychosomatic symptoms (β estimate=-0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.06; P=.003), while anxiety and active coping did not change. Overall, 60% (42/70) of the participants in the intervention group completed the coaching by completing the postintervention survey. They particularly appreciated the quality, quantity, credibility, and visual representation of information. While individual customization was rated the lowest, the target group fitting was perceived as high. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that MISHA is feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing perceived stress among students in Switzerland. Future research is needed with different populations, for example, in students with high stress levels or compared to active controls.

To identify the main connections in two of the currently most trending concepts in business, we undertook a systematic literature review focusing on Big Data, entrepreneurship, and their interconnections in business management through 301 research documents. While numerous studies have already delved individually into Big Data and entrepreneurship, the interconnection between these concepts still has research potential. Our results reflect a growing interest in leading research on these topics, with specific leading authors and countries. Furthermore, we show and discuss a conceptual map consisting of five clusters, unveiling interesting connections such as the impact of blockchain on firms, the correlation between Big Data and firm performance, the role of data science, and the significance of Big Data analytics for operational performance. The article ends by examining how Big Data and entrepreneurship change the business landscape. While entrepreneurs use data for decision-making, innovation, and tailored customer experiences, there are lingering concerns such as data security and privacy. The future of business and innovation will depend, in part, on the crossroads between entrepreneurs and Big Data technologies.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","2763-2790","","4","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a survey method to collect data with a sample consisting of 236 academic staff from universities in Northern Cyprus, and tested hypotheses through three different structural models by using structural equation modeling (SEM). Following a deductive approach to establish constructs in the models, we treated academic intrapreneurial intention as the dependent variable, and self-leadership, self-efficacy, and psychological capital as the independent variables. In addition, attitudes toward intrapreneurship, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were individually tested as mediating variables.

The findings regarding its efficacy compared to face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia are inconclusive but suggest that dCBTi might be inferior. The lack of human support and low treatment adherence are believed to be barriers to dCBTi achieving its optimal efficacy. However, there has yet to be a direct comparative trial of dCBTi with different types of coaching support. OBJECTIVE: This study examines whether adding chatbot-based and human coaching would improve the treatment efficacy of, and adherence to, dCBTi. METHODS: Overall, 129 participants (n=98, 76% women; age: mean 34.09, SD 12.05 y) whose scores on the Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] were greater than 9 were recruited. A randomized controlled comparative trial with 5 arms was conducted: dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching and therapist support (dCBTi-therapist), dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching and research assistant support, dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching only, dCBTi without any coaching, and digital sleep hygiene and self-monitoring control. Participants were blinded to the condition assignment and study hypotheses, and the outcomes were self-assessed using questionnaires administered on the web. The outcomes included measures of insomnia (the ISI and the Sleep Condition Indicator), mood disturbances, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, quality of life, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep-related safety behaviors administered at baseline, after treatment, and at 4-week follow-up. Treatment adherence was measured by the completion of video sessions and sleep diaries. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Significant condition-by-time interaction effects showed that dCBTi recipients, regardless of having any coaching, had greater improvements in insomnia measured by the Sleep Condition Indicator (P=.003; d=0.45) but not the ISI (P=.86; d=-0.28), depressive symptoms (P<.001; d=-0.62), anxiety (P=.01; d=-0.40), fatigue (P=.02; d=-0.35), dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (P<.001; d=-0.53), and safety behaviors related to sleep (P=.001; d=-0.50) than those who received digital sleep hygiene and self-monitoring control. The addition of chatbot-based coaching and human support did not improve treatment efficacy. However, adding human support promoted greater reductions in fatigue (P=.03; d=-0.33) and sleep-related safety behaviors (P=.05; d=-0.30) than dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching only at 4-week follow-up. dCBTi-therapist had the highest video and diary completion rates compared to other conditions (video: 16/25, 60% in dCBTi-therapist vs <3/21, <25% in dCBTi without any coaching), indicating greater treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the efficacy of dCBTi in treating insomnia, reducing thoughts and behaviors that perpetuate insomnia, reducing mood disturbances and fatigue, and improving quality of life. Adding chatbot-based coaching and human support did not significantly improve the efficacy of dCBTi after treatment. However, adding human support had incremental benefits on reducing fatigue and behaviors that could perpetuate insomnia, and hence may improve long-term efficacy.

The published literature on the process of establishing a new medical school is, however, under-developed with minimal empirical research and no explicit reference to theory. This research sought to address these gaps and establish an empirical and theoretical evidence-base for the process of new medical school establishment in diverse contexts, particularly medically under-served areas. METHODS: A Critical Realist Multiple Case Study was undertaken to examine the establishment of new medical schools across three continents. Data were collected between 2016 and 2018 through observational data gathered on site visits to three medical schools in medically under-served areas, relevant documents/audio-visual materials, and semi-structured interviews with key founding personnel. Data were analysed using the Critical Realist approach. Institutional Entrepreneurship theory was applied, adapted, and extended to explore and explain the phenomenon of new medical school establishment in diverse contexts. RESULTS: This study identifies eight critical success factors underpinning new medical school establishment. Framed as the Eight C's Framework (8CF), these factors include Context (field conditions), Catalysts (institutional entrepreneurs), Conducing (helping to bring about a particular situation or outcome), Collecting (resources), Connecting (relationships), Convincing (rationales), Challenges, and Consequences (outcomes). 8CF highlights that new medical schools are successfully established when Catalysts act within their Contexts to undertake the tasks of Conducing, Convincing, Collecting, and Connecting in order to produce desired Consequences and overcome Challenges. CONCLUSIONS: The Eight C's Framework is a theory-based, empirically supported framework that can be applied across different contexts to strategically guide the successful establishment of new medical schools. Founding leaders and stakeholders could use 8CF to ensure their establishment efforts are underpinned by theory and scholarship.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","25-36","","1","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our paper addresses renewed concerns regarding equity in digital health access that were deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our viewpoint is that (1) digital health tools have the potential to improve health equity if equitable access is achieved, and (2) improving access and equity in digital health can be strengthened by considering behavioral science-based strategies embedded in all phases of tool development. Using behavioral, equity, and access frameworks allowed for a unique and comprehensive exploration of current drivers of digital health inequities. This paper aims to present a compilation of strategies that can potentially have an actionable impact on digital health equity. Multilevel factors drive unequal access, so strategies require action from tool developers, individual delivery agents, organizations, and systems to effect change. Strategies were shaped with a behavioral medicine focus as the field has a unique role in improving digital health access; arguably, all digital tools require the user (individual, provider, and health system) to change behavior by engaging with the technology to generate impact. This paper presents a model that emphasizes using multilevel strategies across design, delivery, dissemination, and sustainment stages to advance digital health access and foster health equity.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","e51355","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true for fully automated mHealth apps without any human support. Human support in mHealth apps is associated with better engagement but at the cost of reduced scalability. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to (1) describe the theory-informed development of a fully automated relaxation and mindfulness app to reduce distress in people with cancer (CanRelax app 2.0), (2) describe engagement with the app on multiple levels within a fully automated randomized controlled trial over 10 weeks, and (3) examine whether engagement was related to user characteristics. METHODS: The CanRelax app 2.0 was developed in iterative processes involving input from people with cancer and relevant experts. The app includes evidence-based relaxation exercises, personalized weekly coaching sessions with a rule-based conversational agent, 39 self-enactable behavior change techniques, a self-monitoring dashboard with gamification elements, highly tailored reminder notifications, an educational video clip, and personalized in-app letters. For the larger study, German-speaking adults diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years were recruited via the web in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. Engagement was analyzed in a sample of 100 study participants with multiple measures on a micro level (completed coaching sessions, relaxation exercises practiced with the app, and feedback on the app) and a macro level (relaxation exercises practiced without the app and self-efficacy toward self-set weekly relaxation goals). RESULTS: In week 10, a total of 62% (62/100) of the participants were actively using the CanRelax app 2.0. No associations were identified between engagement and level of distress at baseline, sex assigned at birth, educational attainment, or age. At the micro level, 71.88% (3520/4897) of all relaxation exercises and 714 coaching sessions were completed in the app, and all participants who provided feedback (52/100, 52%) expressed positive app experiences. At the macro level, 28.12% (1377/4897) of relaxation exercises were completed without the app, and participants' self-efficacy remained stable at a high level. At the same time, participants raised their weekly relaxation goals, which indicates a potential relative increase in self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The CanRelax app 2.0 achieved promising engagement even though it provided no human support. Fully automated social components might have compensated for the lack of human involvement and should be investigated further. More than one-quarter (1377/4897, 28.12%) of all relaxation exercises were practiced without the app, highlighting the importance of assessing engagement on multiple levels.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","e52386","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Can this interpersonal process also protect people at risk? We assessed whether fluctuations in suicidal ideation were associated with fluctuations in the degree of perceived responsiveness that psychiatric patients (admitted in the context of suicide or indicating suicidal ideation) experienced in daily interactions immediately after discharge. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients reported on suicidal ideation (5 times a day) and perceived responsiveness (daily) for four consecutive weeks. The effects of established risk factors-thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and hopelessness-were assessed as well. RESULTS: The more patients felt that close others had been responsive to them, the less suicidal ideation they reported. At low levels of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, or hopelessness, perceived responsiveness seemed to play a protective role, negatively co-occurring with suicidal ideation. When thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and hopelessness were high, perceived responsiveness did not have an effect. CONCLUSION: Perceived responsiveness could be a protective factor for suicidal ideation for people at risk only when they are experiencing low levels of negative perceptions. When experiencing highly negative perceptions, however, perceived responsiveness seems to matter less.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","925-933","","6","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike a narrow perspective of bibliometric work, which confines itself to reviewing existing literature within a specific research domain, a broader viewpoint leverages bibliometric analysis to pinpoint potential research opportunities indicative of emerging trends in related fields. Adopting this comprehensive paradigm, the current study scrutinizes 60 articles spanning the timeframe from 1992 to 2021. The analysis discerns six prospective marketing strategies instrumental in propelling a country to global brand prominence: the synergistic integration of country-of-origin and city brands, consumption branding, materialistic branding, green branding, ideological branding, and scientific branding. Notably, environmental branding has assumed a pivotal global role post–2015, while ideological branding represents a more recent trend centered on diligent efforts to invigorate national identity systems. Empirical insights underscore the need of a multidisciplinary approach in the creation of nation brands, suggesting that distinct strategies need not be mutually exclusive. Quantitatively, it is found evidence that covering one additional environmental topic in a study increases (decreases) its likelihood of belonging to the consumption (ideology) cluster by 50.8 (50.6) percentage points, respectively. Strategic recommendations for future national endeavors emphasize the significance of becoming a Stackelberg leader in the race to generate added value. Collectively, these findings underscore that the bibliometric analysis employed to elucidate the evolution of nation brands and brand culture, typically associated with international marketing, unveils two promising niche areas for future research in green finance: green nation brands and green brand culture. The former pertains to asset allocations within green enterprises and environmental sectors, enhancing a country's symbolic commitment to the burgeoning green paradigm. Meanwhile, the later delves into the internalization of fintech development's growth and intermediary effects, fostering green innovation, energy efficiency, and green supply chains. This bottom-up approach is geared towards meeting community-based needs and presents valuable avenues for future exploration in the field of green finance.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","287-347","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The TopCare program was a policy experiment lasting 4 years in which three non-academic hospitals received funding from the Dutch Ministry of Health to also conduct medical research and deliver highly specialized care in specific domains. This study investigates research collaboration outcomes for all Dutch UMCs and non-academic hospitals in general and, more specifically, for the domains in the non-academic hospitals participating in the TopCare program. Additionally, it explores the organizational boundary work employed by these hospitals to foster productive research collaborations.MethodsA mixed method research design was employed combining quantitative bibliometric analysis of publications and citations across all Dutch UMCs and non-academic hospitals and the TopCare domains with geographical distances, document analysis and ethnographic interviews with actors in the TopCare program.ResultsQuantitative analysis shows that, over the period of study, international collaboration increased among all hospitals while national collaboration and single institution research declined slightly. Collaborative efforts correlated with higher impact scores, and international collaboration scored higher than national collaboration. A total of 60% of all non-academic hospitals’ publications were produced in collaboration with UMCs, whereas almost 30% of the UMCs’ publications were the result of such collaboration. Non-academic hospitals showed a higher rate of collaboration with the UMC that was nearest geographically, whereas TopCare hospitals prioritized expertise over geographical proximity within their specialized domains. Boundary work mechanisms adopted by TopCare hospitals included aligning research activities with organizational mindset (identity), bolstering research infrastructure (competence) and finding and mobilizing strategic partnerships with academic partners (power). These efforts aimed to establish credibility and attractiveness as collaboration partners.ConclusionsResearch collaboration between non-academic hospitals and UMCs, particularly where this also involves international collaboration, pays off in terms of publications and impact. The TopCare hospitals used the program’s resources to perform boundary work aimed at becoming an attractive and credible collaboration partner for academia. Local factors such as research history, strategic domain focus, in-house expertise, patient flows, infrastructure and network relationships influenced collaboration dynamics within TopCare hospitals and between them and UMCs.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:10","2025-07-26 09:59:10","","72","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It used a qualitative approach with a case study design and it involved twelve English language teachers and form three students. The qualitative case approach was used to observe the classroom and conduct interviews to collect data and they were analysed thematically. The findings reveal that teachers employ both printed and handwritten materials for English instruction in Tanzania. Learners interact with these materials primarily through reading, writing, and responding to questions. The choice of materials depends on what is being studied, their availability, easiness to use and economic reasons. The study has the implication on the definition of instructional materials that it adds that the definition of materials needs to be modified by including people and their actions, such as humour, laughter, sarcasm, gestures, bodily movements, reactions to stimuli like questions, speech and its supra segmental or prosodic features during instruction.

Romantic partners play a critical role in managing chronic health conditions as they tend to be a primary source of support. OBJECTIVE: This study tests the feasibility of using commercial wearables to monitor couples' unique way of communicating and supporting each other and documents the physiological correlates of interpersonal dynamics (ie, heart rate linkage). METHODS: We analyzed 617 audio recordings of 5-minute duration (384 with concurrent heart rate data) and 527 brief self-reports collected from 11 couples in which 1 partner had type II diabetes during the course of their typical daily lives. Audio data were coded by trained raters for social support. The extent to which heart rate fluctuations were linked among couples was quantified using cross-correlations. Random-intercept multilevel models explored whether cross-correlations might differ by social contexts and exchanges. RESULTS: Sixty percent of audio recordings captured speech between partners and partners reported personal contact with each other in 75% of self-reports. Based on the coding, social support was found in 6% of recordings, whereas at least 1 partner self-reported social support about half the time (53%). Couples, on average, showed small to moderate interconnections in their heart rate fluctuations (r=0.04-0.22). Couples also varied in the extent to which there was lagged linkage, that is, meaning that changes in one partner's heart rate tended to precede changes in the other partner's heart rate. Exploratory analyses showed that heart rate linkage was stronger (1) in rater-coded partner conversations (vs moments of no rater-coded partner conversations: r<sub>diff</sub>=0.13; P=.03), (2) when partners self-reported interpersonal contact (vs moments of no self-reported interpersonal contact: r<sub>diff</sub>=0.20; P&lt;.001), and (3) when partners self-reported social support exchanges (vs moments of no self-reported social support exchange: r<sub>diff</sub>=0.15; P=.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides initial evidence for the utility of using wearables to collect biopsychosocial data in couples managing a chronic health condition in daily life. Specifically, heart rate linkage might play a role in fostering chronic disease management as a couple. Insights from collecting such data could inform future technology interventions to promote healthy lifestyle engagement and adaptive chronic disease management.

Current treatments aim to resolve dysfunctional coupling between them. However, precise interactions between emotions and avoidance in patients' everyday lives and changes from pre- to post-treatment remain unclear. We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial where patients with anxiety disorders underwent 16 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Fifty-six patients (68 % female, age: M = 33.31, SD = 12.45) completed ecological momentary assessments five times a day on 14 consecutive days before and after treatment, rating negative emotions and avoidance behaviors experienced within the past 30 min. We computed multilevel vector autoregressive models to investigate contemporaneous and time-lagged associations between anxiety, depression, anger, and avoidance behaviors within patients, separately at pre- and post-treatment. We examined pre-post changes in network density and avoidance centrality, and related these metrics to changes in symptom severity. Network density significantly decreased from pre- to post-treatment, indicating that after therapy, mutual interactions between negative emotions and avoidance were attenuated. Specifically, contemporaneous associations between anxiety and avoidance observed before CBT were no longer significant at post-treatment. Effects of negative emotions on avoidance assessed at a later time point (avoidance instrength) decreased, but not significantly. Reduction in avoidance instrength positively correlated with reduction in depressive symptom severity, meaning that as patients improved, they were less likely to avoid situations after experiencing negative emotions. Our results elucidate mechanisms of successful CBT observed in patients' daily lives and may help improve and personalize CBT to increase its effectiveness.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:11","2025-07-26 09:59:11","","102914","","","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a comprehensive overview of whether and which non-pharmaceutical interventions may impact human epigenetic aging is missing. Synthesizing evidence of interventions on epigenetic aging that can be adopted by a wider population is key to guide healthy aging initiatives and to reduce the burden of NCDs and CMDs. This scoping review will identify and assess non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed to slow down epigenetic aging, including their intervention components, and the mode used for intervention delivery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol will include single- and multicomponent intervention studies that target individuals ≥ 18 years of age and use epigenetic clocks as primary or secondary outcomes. Five electronic databases will be searched for studies between July 2011 until December 2023. The final search will include the search terms adults, non-pharmaceutical interventions, epigenetic aging and their respective synonyms. We will include randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies. Additionally, the reference list of other reviews will be screened for relevant articles. Study selection is carried out based on the defined eligibility criteria by two authors. Quality and risk of bias for the included studies will be assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Data extraction will include generic key information such as the research question and results, the intervention components, and specific epigenetic outcome measures used. Further data regarding the delivery mode of the treatment protocol will be collected. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This scoping review will summarize the characteristics of non-pharmaceutical intervention studies on epigenetic aging. This review will be the first step to formally identify key intervention components and delivery modes to guide future research on healthy aging interventions. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and presented at relevant conferences. This review will synthesize information from available publications and does not require further ethical approval.

Through a reverse blending modelling approach, data on 359 different organic wastes were used to identify 38 fertiliser blends. Materials found to be particularly suitable as blending materials were various biochars and ashes, due to their low nitrogen and high phosphorus and/or potassium content, and byproduct concentrates, due to their high phosphorus content, since the nitrogen content of human urine is disproportionately higher than its phosphorus content. Several organic wastes were suitable for fertilising more than one crop. The macronutrient content of the simulated fertiliser blends was comparable to that of blended inorganic fertilisers, but only a few blends precisely matched the macronutrient demand of crops. Fertilising crops with some simulated fertilisers would potentially result in excess application of one or more macronutrients, and thus overfertilisation. For organic wastes with data available on their content of six or more heavy metals, it was found that the simulated fertilisers generally met European Union regulations on use of fertilisers of organic origin in agriculture. Overall, these findings suggest that fertiliser blends combining dehydrated human urine and organic wastes, both of which are widely available globally, could replace inorganic blended fertilisers in agriculture. Such recycling would help the global food system and water sector transition to circularity and promote better management of plant-essential nutrients in society.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:11","2025-07-26 09:59:11","","175655","","","951","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to examine the relationship between Smart Logistics Policy (SLP) and firm performance both theoretically and empirically. Utilizing data from A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2012 and 2017, this study analyzes the relationship between SLP and firm performance using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Differences (DID). The results indicate that SLP significantly enhances a firm's financial performance. Additionally, a heterogeneity test on financial performance reveals that the impact of SLP varies based on ownership and industrial sector. Unexpectedly, SLP has a negative impact on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. The heterogeneity test on CSR performance shows that the SLP effect on CSR exhibits no significant difference based on ownership. Furthermore, the impact of SLP on CSR is significantly greater for manufacturing firms compared to non-manufacturing firms. Consequently, this study offers theoretical support and empirical evidence regarding the effects of SLP on firm performance.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:11","2025-07-26 09:59:11","","e36623","","17","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explored potential differences in HPV16 variants between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. HPV16-postive viral loads were detected in 1.9% (17/875) and 13% (162/760) of vaccinated and unvaccinated women, respectively, showcasing the vaccine's high efficacy. The L1, E6, and URR regions of HPV16 were sequenced from genital swabs from 16 vaccinated and 25 unvaccinated women in the HAVANA (HPV Among Vaccinated And Non-vaccinated Adolescents) study. The majority of HPV16 variants from vaccinated and unvaccinated women clustered similarly with sub-lineages A1 and A2. Additionally, a separate cluster within lineage A was found, with the variants sharing the L1-located SNP A753G (synonymous) and the URR-located SNP T340C, which did not occur in the other variants. Furthermore, four variants from vaccinated women had relatively long branches, but were not characterized by specific SNPs. The frequency of G712A in the URR was the only SNP observed to be marginally higher among vaccinated women than unvaccinated women. Non-synonymous SNPs T266A in the FG-loop of L1 and L83V in E6 were common among variants from vaccinated and unvaccinated women, but present in similar frequencies. In conclusion, the detection of HPV16 in vaccinated (and unvaccinated) women seemed to be the result of random circulation within this study population.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:11","2025-07-26 09:59:11","","1381","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We constructed datasets of patent applications and patent transfers to firms from 383 universities between 2002 and 2021 in China, and empirically demonstrated the effect of the patent output on university patent transfer network using negative binomial regression models. We also examined the moderating effects of absorptive capacity and desorptive capacity. The results reveal that university patent output positively affects the size and the connection strength of the university patent transfer network. Technology transfer offices and satellite institutions, for desorptive capacity in universities, negatively moderate the relationship between the university patent output and the university patent transfer network, respectively. For absorptive capacity in firms, research and development intensity of new products and the level of research and development personnel input, respectively, have a positively moderate effect on the relationship between the university patent output and the university patent transfer network. Our research provides insights into the dynamics of the university patent transfer network; especially against the backdrop of a sharp increase in university patent output and insufficient development of the university patent transfer network, this study provides evidence to the substitution effect of desorptive capacity in universities and the bidirectional effect of absorptive capacity in firms.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:11","2025-07-26 09:59:11","","e37762","","18","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inductively theorizing from our interview data, we explain how individual professionals experience different intensities of stigmatization from colleagues when working with digital innovations. We theorize that the more central a dual-role professional is within an organization and the more their innovation deviates from standard professional duties, the more likely the innovation is to be viewed as impure within a professional group and be the target of stigmatization.

Despite their potential for technological advancements, ASOs often struggle with challenges in financial performance and growth. Traditional explanations attribute these challenges to a lack of commercial resources and competencies. However, since ASOs often demonstrate prolonged survival, such explanations may not fully explain the paradox in ASOs’ outcomes. This paper offers a novel perspective, highlighting how non-economic goals, deeply ingrained in the academic context in which ASOs originate, shape their behavior and outcomes. These goals, related to the dimensions of control, identity, and emotions, go beyond financial gains, reflecting concerns that are specific to the academic environment. Integrating the organizational goals literature with insights from academic entrepreneurship research, we present a conceptual model describing the origins and nature of these goals and explain how they can help shedding light on some paradoxes in ASOs’ development, growth, and performance events.

Digital health technologies (DHTs) hold promising potential to address these inequities and to play a pivotal role in advancing health equity. However, there is a notable gap regarding a comprehensive and structured overview of existing frameworks and guidelines on advancing health equity and a clear understanding of the potential of DHTs in their implementation. To this end, our primary objectives are first to identify prevalent frameworks and guidelines that promote health equity and second to pinpoint the contemporary role of DHTs as an avenue for implementing these frameworks and guidelines. This synthesis will guide future DHTs, ensuring equitable accessibility and effectiveness and ultimately contributing to enhancing health equity among marginalised populations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This work adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Scoping Reviews. To identify pertinent evidence, we will employ seven electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and WISO) encompassing the fields of medicine, healthcare and social sciences. Moreover, selected grey literature will be considered.

To identify diagnostic tissue and sites with increased microcirculation, intraoperative optical techniques have been suggested. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical implications of in situ optical guidance in frameless navigated tumor biopsies. Methods: Real-time feedback on protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence, microcirculation, and gray-whiteness was given before tissue sampling (272 positions) in 20 patients along 21 trajectories in total. The primary variables of investigation were fluorescence in relation to neuropathological findings and gadolinium (Gd) enhancement, increased cerebral microcirculation in relation to bleeding incidence, number of trajectories, and impact on operation time. Results: PpIX fluorescence was detected in Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype CNS WHO grade 4 (<i>n</i> = 12), Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (<i>n</i> = 3), astrocytoma IDH-mutated CNS WHO grade 4 (<i>n</i> = 1) (Ki67 indices ≥ 15%). For 2 patients, no PpIX fluorescence or Gd was found, although samples contained tumorous tissue (Ki67 index 6%). Increased microcirculation was found along 9 trajectories (34 sites), located in cortical, tumorous, or tentorium regions. Postoperative bleedings (<i>n</i> = 10, nine asymptomatic) were related to skull opening or tissue sampling. This study strengthens the proposed independence from intraoperative neuropathology as PpIX fluorescence is detected. Objective real-time feedback resulted in fewer trajectories compared to previous studies indicating reduced operation time. Conclusions: The integrated optical guidance system provides real-time feedback in situ, increasing certainty and precision of diagnostic tissue before sampling during frameless brain tumor biopsies.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:11","2025-07-26 09:59:11","","vdae175","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wearable devices and smartphones are increasingly used to track and manage modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases. However, no established guidelines exist on how to derive meaningful signals from these devices, often hampering cross-study comparisons. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically overview the current empirical literature on how wearables and smartphones are used to track modifiable (physiological and lifestyle) risk factors associated with metabolic diseases. METHODS: We will conduct a scoping review to overview how wearable and smartphone-based studies measure modifiable risk factors related to metabolic diseases. We will search 5 databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SPORTDiscus) from 2019 to 2024, with search terms related to wearables, smartphones, and modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases. Eligible studies will use smartphones or wearables (worn on the wrist, finger, arm, hip, and chest) to track physiological or lifestyle factors related to metabolic diseases. We will follow the reporting guideline standards from PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) and the JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) guidance on scoping review methodology. Two reviewers will independently screen articles for inclusion and extract data using a standardized form. The findings will be synthesized and reported qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS: Data collection is expected to begin in November 2024; data analysis in the first quarter of 2025; and submission to a peer-reviewed journal by the second quarter of 2025. We expect to identify the degree to which wearable and smartphone-based studies track modifiable risk factors collectively (versus in isolation), and the consistency and variation in how modifiable risk factors are measured across existing studies. CONCLUSIONS: Results are expected to inform more standardized guidelines on wearable and smartphone-based measurements, with the goal of aiding cross-study comparison. The final report is planned for submission to a peer-reviewed, indexed journal. This review is among the first to systematically overview the current landscape on how wearables and smartphones measure modifiable risk factors associated with metabolic diseases.

Frailty, a multidimensional syndrome, increases vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Although physical exercise is effective, adherence among older adults with frailty is often low due to barriers. Motion-based video games (MBVGs) may enhance motivation and engagement. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effect of individualized exercise programs that combine MBVGs, intergenerational support, and therapeutic frameworks on physical, cognitive, and social frailty outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted from March 2022 to October 2023 across 6 community centers in Hong Kong. Participants aged 60 years and above with mild neurocognitive disorder were recruited, screened, and randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=101) or control group (n=101). The intervention included an 18-week program with 12 supervised exercise sessions utilizing motion-based technology, led by occupational therapists and assisted by youth volunteers. Data were collected at baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2), focusing on physical, cognitive, and social frailty outcomes, as well as client-related metrics. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, with significance set at P<.05. Results: A total of 202 participants were recruited, with a mean age of 78.8 years (SD 7.8). Both groups showed improvements in balance from T1 to T2, with a significant time effect (β=-0.63, P=.03). The intervention group demonstrated enhancements in hand strength and BMI, but no statistically significant between-group differences were observed. The intervention group also exhibited significant improvements in cognitive function (β=2.43, P<.001), while the control group's scores declined. Short-term memory improved for both groups, with no significant differences noted. Both groups experienced a reduction in depression levels, with a significant within-group effect at T2 (β=-1.16, P=.001). Improvements in social connectedness and eHealth literacy were observed in both groups, with the latter showing a significant within-group effect at T2 (β=3.56, P=.002). No significant effects were found for social isolation, physical activities, or quality of life. Conclusions: The growing aging population necessitates innovative strategies to support aging in place. Results indicated statistically significant improvements only in BMI and cognition, while other outcomes such as loneliness, balance, and eHealth literacy showed positive trends but lacked significance.

The so-called third mission is also becoming an increasingly important aspect of university operations. This involves leveraging knowledge generated at the university level to create close links with society and the economy. The role of intrapreneurs has been examined in the corporate, for-profit sector. However, these agents of change also play a significant role in the advancement of entrepreneurial universities. The present research investigates the role of intrapreneurs in entrepreneurial universities through a bibliographic analysis using RStudio biblioshiny on the Scopus and Web of Science databases. It is evident that the literature on this subject has gained interest in recent years, yet the number of documents remains limited, with a small number of authors publishing them. The development of keywords is also notable, including the emergence of sustainability, which is linked to intrapreneurs and the entrepreneurial universities. Although this study has its limitations, it can show how and where authors should publish, what the basic and the emerging topics are, what the most important keywords are and how these are connected and how countries cooperate in searching for solutions in this globally recognized research area.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 14:51:35","","327","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our research aims to identify the categories needed to capture direct or indirect public contributions to R&D, provide a framework for standardized reporting of public contributions, and reduce ambiguity in the interpretation of ""direct"" and ""indirect"" public contributions. METHODS: An iterative mixed-methods approach is applied: a targeted literature review was conducted, complemented by interviews with representatives of different stakeholder groups to identify categories of public contributions to R&D, followed by searches for relevant data sources. RESULTS: 26 publications on primary data relevant to analyses of public contributions were identified, finding that between half of all drugs approved and >90 % of drug targets are associated with public sector institutions and/ or their spin-outs. Eight categories of public contributions to medical innovations were identified along the value chain (from basic research to post-market surveillance). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The framework offers a structured and systematic approach for identifying data on public and philanthropic contributions to developing medical products (medicines and devices). This information is often not comprehensively documented. Therefore, aligned public policies enforcing transparent and standardized reporting in sufficient granularity on R&D investments and conditions are key.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","105235","","","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assess the funding and distribution of cancer investigation. Present actions for the development of oncology research, innovation and patient care.MethodsTriangulating objective system metrics of economic, epidemiological, private and public sector resources together with policy analysis, we assessed cancer burden, infrastructure, and investigation. We analyzed governmental and private-sector cancer databases, complemented by interviews with cancer stakeholders.ResultsGovernmental policy and patient advocacy have led to the recognition of cancer burden, a cancer law, and a national cancer plan. Cancer has become the leading cause of death in Chile (59,876 cases and 31,440 cancer deaths in 2022), yet only 0.36% gross domestic product (GDP) is directed to research and development. Inequalities in treatment regimens persist. Prevention policy has lowered tobacco consumption, sugar intake via soft drinks and offered a high coverage of HPV vaccines. A high-quality cancer research community is expanding, and internationally sponsored clinical oncology trials are increasing.ConclusionsThe cancer law has facilitated advancement in policy. Prevention policies have impacted tobacco and sugar intake, while gender equality and care inequality have entered the public forum. Cancer research is stagnated by the lack of investment. Implementation of a cancer registry and biobanking, reinforcement of prevention strategies, development of human resources, promotion of clinical trial infrastructure and investment in new technologies must be placed as a priority to permit advancements in innovation and equitable cancer care.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","95","","1","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These disorders disproportionately affect older adults relative to those younger. Digital health technologies (DHTs), such as patient monitoring, digital diagnostics and digital therapeutics, emerge as promising tools for health promotion in day-to-day life. However, their role in targeting metabolic disorders, particularly among a key demographic of older adults, is not yet fully understood. Thus, this study aims to scope the use of DHTs in managing metabolic health disorders among older adults. To our knowledge, this is the first review to categorise DHTs for older adults with metabolic disorders, contributing to the growing literature in the intersection of metabolic disorders and DHTs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a scoping review following the recommended framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Our search will focus on three primary concepts: metabolic disorders, DHTs and older adults. We plan to search five online databases (Cochrane, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) to identify original research articles published between January 2014 and January 2024. Two independent reviewers will screen articles based on predefined eligibility criteria, with a third reviewer resolving conflicts. Data will be extracted using a standardised form, and results will be synthesised qualitatively and quantitatively. The database searches, data collection and analysis are planned and have not been conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is required for this protocol and scoping review. Data will be used only from published studies with appropriate ethics approval. Results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed publication.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","e085797","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite significant advances in the diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of thrombotic diseases over the past 3 decades, the adoption of findings stemming from translational biomarker research in clinical practice remains limited. Biomarkers provide an opportunity to enhance our understanding of pathophysiological processes and optimize treatment strategies. They hold the promise of revolutionizing patient care. Still, this potential remains untapped, and several factors impede their use for near-patient applications. We sought to provide an overview of biomarker research in arterial and venous thromboembolic disease. We then aimed to discuss key barriers to the broader clinical implementation of biomarker research and highlight promising strategies to overcome them. We emphasize the merits of translational and implementation science to bridge the gaps from bench to bedside. Innovative trial design, data sharing, and collaborative efforts between academia and industry will be essential. Purposeful regression methodology using rational conceptual framework design, causal mediation analysis, and artificial intelligence might better leverage the use of observational data. Dedicated translational science training programs geared toward educating physicians on the appropriate measurement, interpretation, and integration of biomarker data in clinical practice should foster endorsement by frontline physicians. Finally, we make the case in support of a paradigm shift in cardiovascular medicine. Improved recognition of biomarker research and a greater emphasis on mechanistic evidence can better equip clinicians to deal with the uncertainty that defines the practice of thrombosis medicine.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","e038782","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this issue's growing importance, no systematic literature review has explicitly examined the influence of digital platforms on gig workers. This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive review of 18 articles out of 81 published between 2019 and 2023, retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using the PRISMA framework. Thematic analysis revealed 12 key themes that capture the complex influence of digital platforms on gig workers, suggesting that platforms offer both opportunities and challenges. Digital platforms provide low barriers to entry, facilitate task allocation, and offer flexible work arrangements. However, gig workers face significant challenges, such as a lack of social protections, algorithmic control, intense competition, and downward pressure on wages. The implications are significant for sustainable economic development in the platform economy, underscoring the importance of collective organizing, re-evaluating platform practices, and strengthening labor regulations. As the gig economy expands globally, researchers, platforms, and policymakers must work together to ensure that the benefits of digital platforms are shared more equitably and that gig workers can thrive in this new world of work. Given the scarcity of papers published about this topic, the study has no specific focus on region and industry. In addition, this study only extracts papers that are published in English.","2024","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","e41491","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This protocol describes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomised trial aimed at (i) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LvL UP, an mHealth lifestyle intervention for the prevention of NCDs and CMDs, and (ii) establishing the optimal blended approach in LvL UP that balances effective personalised lifestyle support with scalability. METHODS: LvL UP is a 6-month mHealth holistic intervention targeting physical activity, diet, and emotional regulation. In this trial, young and middle-aged Singaporean adults at risk of developing NCDs or CMDs will be randomly allocated to one of two initial conditions ('LvL UP' or 'comparison'). After 4 weeks, participants categorised as non-responders from the LvL UP group will be re-randomised into second-stage conditions: (i) continuing with the initial intervention (LvL UP) or (ii) additional motivational interviewing (MI) support sessions by trained health coaches (LvL UP + adaptive MI). The primary outcome is mental well-being. Secondary outcomes include anthropometric measurements, resting blood pressure, blood metabolic profile, health status, and health behaviours (physical activity, diet). Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months (post-intervention), and 12 months (follow-up). DISCUSSION: In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LvL UP, the proposed study design will contribute to increasing evidence on how to introduce human support in mHealth interventions to maximise their effectiveness while remaining scalable.

However, despite the proliferation of digital health companies for T2D care, scaling their solutions remains a critical challenge. This study investigates the digital transformation of T2D ecosystems and seeks to identify key innovation patterns. We examine: (1) What are emerging organizations in digital diabetes ecosystems? (2) What are the value streams in digital T2D ecosystems? (3) Which innovation patterns are present in digital T2D ecosystems? Methods: We conducted a literature review and market analysis to characterize organizations and value streams in T2D ecosystems, pre- and post-digital transformation. We used the e3-value methodology to visualize T2D ecosystems (RQ1 and RQ2) and conducted expert interviews to identify emerging innovation patterns in digital diabetes ecosystems (RQ3). Results: Our analyses revealed the emergence of eight organization segments in digital diabetes ecosystems: real-world evidence analytics, healthcare management platforms, clinical decision support, diagnostic and monitoring, digital therapeutics, wellness, online community, and online pharmacy (RQ1). Visualizing the value streams among these organizations highlights the crucial importance of individual health data (RQ2). Furthermore, our analysis revealed four major innovation patterns within the digital diabetes ecosystem: open ecosystem strategies, outcome-based payment models, platformization, and user-centric software (RQ3). Conclusions: Our findings illustrate the transition from traditional value chains in T2D care to platform-based and outcome-oriented models. These innovation patterns can inform strategic decisions for companies and healthcare providers, potentially helping anticipate new digital trends in diabetes care and across other chronic disease ecosystems.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","20552076241311740","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this gap, using advanced bibliometric tools, we were able to uncover key themes such as the role of human, cultural, and social capital, educational models, and the evolving function of universities in fostering entrepreneurship. Findings suggest a shift towards multidisciplinary approaches, integrating fields like psychology, ethics, and neuroscience, to enrich EE frameworks. By highlighting both established and emerging topics, this review offers actionable insights for reshaping EE to better equip future leaders with the competencies and resilience needed in an entrepreneurial society.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","61","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unhydrolyzed urine, stabilized with sulfuric acid, was concentrated by convective evaporation, achieving concentration factors (CF) of up to 30 at 20 °C and 43 at 70 °C. Water activity (a<sub>w</sub>) was a reliable indicator for monitoring urine dehydration progress, with a critical threshold of 0.3 a<sub>w</sub> identified at CF 43, indicating tightly bound residual moisture which prevented further urine dehydration. No detectable losses of urea, major cations, or anions were observed throughout the treatment, suggesting that previous findings on nutrient loss were likely affected by analytical limitations as opposed to chemical degradation. Reconstitution to CF 1, followed by colorimetric analysis, was effective in determining nutrient content in viscous and solidified urine samples. At CFs above 30, over 80 % of urea, ammonium, and orthophosphate remained in the liquid phase, whereas sulphate, chloride, and potassium preferentially crystallized, forming compounds such as gypsum, syngenite, and biphosphammite. These findings demonstrate that adjusting dehydration conditions enables the nutrient profile of urine-derived fertilizers to be tailored to meet specific agricultural or environmental requirements. Overall, this study shows that stepwise evaporation-crystallization of acidified human urine can effectively produce multi-nutrient fertilizers with customizable nutrient compositions, thus enhancing targeted nutrient recirculation in agriculture.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","178709","","","966","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking an inductive qualitative approach, we conduct interviews of 54 experienced GHD professionals working across government, civil society, and private industry in 23 countries and identify key themes that outline challenges and opportunities for capacity building in GHD. Findings indicate a nascent global community bound by shared identity and motivations, but also hurdles regarding the transfer of tacit knowledge, network integration, and the improvement of institutional leadership. These findings highlight the boundaries by which knowledge and capacity are difficult for health diplomats to acquire or transfer, which help explain limitations to achieving better outcomes for global health.

Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the safety of CNS depressants to prevent fatalities. Pharmacological pursuits aiming to prevent harm through the design of non-addictive alternatives have either failed before clinical trials or produced mediocre treatment alternatives. Therefore, we propose a new perspective for medicinal chemists: rather than aiming to prevent misuse, we must design new central nervous system (CNS) depressants under the expectation of misuse. By shifting the design focus to partial modulators rather than full agonists, we can develop novel chemical entities (NCEs) that intrinsically minimize physical harm caused by misuse without sacrificing therapeutic efficacy. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the two most widely misused classes of medications (opioid and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators) in relation to pharmacodynamic properties and clinical outcomes. We then suggest a drug discovery pathway focused on physiological parameters. It is our opinion that this approach would dramatically decrease the lethality of overdose and improve outcomes of treatments for pain, anxiety, and withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","681-692","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study seeks to expand the understanding on the role of Latin American universities on entrepreneurial ecosystems by examining the case of alumni from Escuela Politécnica Nacional (EPN). Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research explores individual, organizational, and institutional dynamics within the Ecuadorian entrepreneurial ecosystem. Results indicate that universities like EPN nurture professional and technical capabilities but face institutional obstacles that restrict their capacity to foster knowledge-based, high-growth ventures. This study highlights several institutional-level barriers, including market dominance, limited access to formal financing, corruption, and complex regulations, that limit innovation. Thus, universities in the region play an important role in preparing potential entrepreneurs, yet their impact is ultimately restricted by contextual factors. To overcome these challenges, universities can strengthen their support by integrating entrepreneurship education, networking opportunities, early-stage venture experiences, and exposure to role models or success stories. Particularly in contexts like Ecuador, fostering self-efficacy, resilience, and opportunity recognition can boost entrepreneurial behavior. In addition, enhancing university–industry collaboration, encouraging business transparency, improving funding accessibility, and supporting knowledge-intensive businesses are essential steps to harness the full potential of universities in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:12","2025-07-26 09:59:12","","108","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this multitude of perspectives reflects the conceptual richness of design, it simultaneously complicates the accumulation of scholarly understanding. To address this issue, we have conducted a systematic literature review, uncovering the philosophical assumptions underpinning different interpretations of design in entrepreneurship: (i) design as ontology ( entrepreneurship as design ), (ii) design as epistemology ( entrepreneurship research as design research ), (iii) design as phenomenology ( entrepreneurship as a means to design ), (iv) design as logic ( entrepreneurship by design ) and (v) design as methodology ( entrepreneurship through design ).

PURPOSE: This study explores factors influencing DH adoption in a multicultural population and identifies strategies to improve equitable access. METHODS: Using a Patient and Public Involvement approach, lay facilitators engaged adults at public eateries in Singapore to discuss motivations and barriers to DH adoption. A semi-structured guide facilitated discussions, followed by an optional socio-demographic survey. Data were analyzed through inductive thematic analysis and mapped to behavior change theory to identify mechanisms of action (MoA) and behavior change techniques (BCTs) to support adoption. RESULTS: Facilitators engaged 118 participants between November 2022 and February 2023. Five key themes were identified from the discussions: (a) awareness of DH solutions, (b) weighing benefits against burdens, (c) accessibility, (d) trust in DH developers and technology, and (e) the impact of user experience. These themes were mapped to 13 MoA and 26 BCTs, informing five key strategies to enhance DH adoption: community-based promotion of credible DH solutions and digital literacy training, brief counselling at opportune moments in healthcare settings, variable rewards tied to personal values, policies ensuring accessibility and regulation, and gamified, user-friendly designs emphasizing feedback and behavioral cues. CONCLUSION: Designing and implementing DH solutions that are accessible, trustworthy, and motivating-integrated within healthcare services and promoted through community efforts-can address barriers to adoption by diverse communities and may help to narrow the digital divide.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","ibaf010","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We highlight trends and hurdles in the FAM intervention pyramid. Our viewpoint is to indicate how interventions might change the future demand for specific food groups, their transport in supply chains, and the technologies used to process them. On the basis of national guidelines, dietary interventions can help to prevent and treat many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. FAM R&D and services offer more individualized treatments. This is challenging given the interindividual variability and complexity of the body's response to food and related factors, such as dietary habits, genetics, lifestyle, and biosphere. Quantifying health improvements is essential to prove the added value of more individualized FAM interventions compared with adopting a general healthy diet. It is unclear which level of individualization of interventions produces the largest health benefits at the lowest costs for the patient, healthcare system, and climate. FAM interventions can support and complement conventional medical treatment. They will require a shift to producing more health-promoting foods, including whole foods, minimally processed foods, and selected processed foods.

Generating this conceptual clarity is crucial as it allows researchers and policy actors to recognize the diversity of religious expressions with respect to sustainability action, and grasp the conditions under which religious actors are best equipped to address sustainability challenges.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","1318-1333","","8","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is partly due to low levels of entrepreneurship in the private sector and limited investment in startups. Therefore, it is crucial for the Japanese government to provide financial support for biopharmaceutical startups. This study aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the current state of government grants and investments for biopharmaceutical startups in Japan, as well as to discuss the associated challenges and future directions. Both grant programs specifically focused on drug discovery and development and those supporting a broader range of industries, including drug discovery and development, were identified through literature reviews and web searches. Advisory programs affiliated with government agencies that assist biopharmaceutical startups were also identified. Additionally, the government has established national university funds at four universities, which have made investments in biopharmaceutical startups. While the government offers various grant programs to support biopharmaceutical startups at different stages of research and development, the relatively small scale of these grants and limited support for seed-stage projects pose significant challenges. Consulting services provided by the government, which offer advice on drug development strategies and processes, have been particularly beneficial for university researchers in Japan who lack expertise in drug discovery and development. However, some initiatives spread across different ministries, highlighting the need for a more unified national approach.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","e70106","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NCDs, the leading causes of death, disproportionately affect older adults, placing significant pressure on healthcare services. By 2050, nearly 30% of Europe’s population will be aged 65 or older, up from 20% in 2023. These challenges demand urgent solutions to sustain healthcare systems. Patient-facing digital health technologies (DHTs), such as Digital Diagnostics and Digital Therapeutics, offer promising tools to address this burden by empowering patient self-management, reducing strain on healthcare professionals, and enhancing system efficiency. Despite their potential, the scaling and adoption of DHTs remain limited. This study investigates: (RQ1) What key factors drive success across different patient-facing DHT categories? and (RQ2) How can companies implement these factors?MethodsFollowing COREQ guidelines, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 executives and founders of European DHT companies targeting NCDs. Participants were identified using PitchBook, focusing on revenue-generating companies with over 20 employees. Virtual interviews were conducted in English between May and September 2024, lasting an average of 28 min (range: 21–40). Data saturation determined the sample size. Thematic analysis was performed, with two researchers independently coding the data to ensure reliability. Success factors were categorized as internal (e.g., employees) or external (e.g., partnerships). Ethical approval was obtained, and data was anonymized. A follow-up survey (n = 27) was conducted to confirm our findings.ResultsWe identified 18 success factors for scaling patient-facing DHTs. Health & Wellness companies prioritized business model flexibility, while Digital Therapeutics relied on regulatory compliance. Validation of health impact was critical across categories, emphasized by all respondents in Digital Diagnostics and Digital Therapeutics. Other key factors included customer awareness, strategic partnerships, and investor alignment, highlighting the importance of tailored growth strategies.ConclusionThis study provides structured guidance for scaling patient-facing DHTs, emphasizing category-specific strategies aligned with operational, regulatory, and consumer demands. It offers actionable recommendations for founders and executives to allocate resources effectively and adapt to diverse market contexts. By addressing the unique challenges of scaling DHTs, this work contributes to advancing digital health research and improving healthcare system resilience.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","632","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the scope and characteristics of current AI applications in resuscitation remain unclear. Methods: This scoping review aims to map the existing literature on AI applications in CA and resuscitation and identify research gaps for further investigation. PRISMA-ScR framework and ILCOR guidelines were followed. A systematic literature search across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane identified AI applications in resuscitation. Articles were screened and classified by AI methodology, study design, outcomes, and implementation settings. AI-assisted data extraction was manually validated for accuracy. Results: Out of 4046 records, 197 studies met inclusion criteria. Most were retrospective (90%), with only 16 prospective studies and 2 randomised controlled trials. AI was predominantly applied in prediction of CA, rhythm classification, and post-resuscitation outcome prognostication. Machine learning was the most commonly used method (50% of studies), followed by deep learning and, less frequently, natural language processing. Reported performance was generally high, with AUROC values often exceeding 0.85; however, external validation was rare and real-world implementation limited. Conclusions: While AI applications in resuscitation demonstrate encouraging performance in prediction and decision support tasks, clear evidence of improved patient outcomes or routine clinical use remains limited. Future research should focus on prospective validation, equity in data sources, explainability, and seamless integration of AI tools into clinical workflows.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","100973","","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although traditional literature often portrays these logics as inherently conflicting, emphasizing the trade‐offs ASOs must manage, recent empirical findings challenge this view, suggesting that integrating academic and business logics can be beneficial. This paper presents a systematic review of the ASO literature, leveraging the concept of duality to explore the dynamic interplay between academic and business logics. The duality perspective underscores the importance of considering both complementarities and oppositions between seemingly incompatible logics. By synthesizing existing empirical findings, we propose a framework that clarifies how the oppositions and complementarities between academic and business logics influence ASOs’ academic and business outcomes. Our framework highlights the need for more nuanced, dynamic and multilevel approaches in studying ASOs, offering future research directions that embrace the duality perspective. This integrative view aims to inspire further investigation into hybrid ventures, illustrating how economic and non‐economic logics can jointly foster both non‐economic and economic outcomes.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, digital dementia-preventive lifestyle services (DDLS) emerge as potentially pivotal services, aiming to address modifiable risk factors on a large scale. This study aims to identify the top-funded companies offering DDLS and evaluate their clinical evidence to gain insights into the international service landscape. METHODS: A systematic screening of two financial databases (Pitchbook and Crunchbase) was conducted. Corresponding published clinical evidence was collected through a systematic literature review and analyzed regarding study purpose, results, quality of results, and level of clinical evidence. FINDINGS: The ten top-funded companies offering DDLS received a total funding of EUR 128.52 million, of which three companies collected more than 75%. Clinical evidence was limited due to only nine eligible publications, small clinical subject groups, the absence of longitudinal study designs, and no direct evidence of dementia prevention. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the level of funding received by companies does not reflect the clinical effectiveness of DDLS. The study serves as an initial step toward understanding how DDLS are currently evaluated in today's market and highlights the need for a more rigorous evaluation of DDLS effectiveness.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","e0323390","","5","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We, therefore, aimed to investigate the sublingual microcirculation in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Specifically, we sought to test the primary hypothesis that the sublingual microcirculation is persistently impaired during major abdominal surgery.MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we assessed the sublingual microcirculation using vital microscopy before induction of general anesthesia, at the time of surgical incision, every 20 min during surgery, and on the first postoperative day in 46 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The primary endpoint was the area under a proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) of 92% as a measure of the duration and severity of capillary red blood cell flow impairment.ResultsThe median [interquartile range (IQR)] intraoperative area under a PPV of 92% was 71%⋅min [2%⋅min–278%⋅min], and the median [IQR] time-weighted average PPV < 92% was 0.3% [0%–0.9%]. Twelve patients (26%) had an area under a PPV of 92% of 0%⋅min, and five patients (11%) had an area under a PPV of 92% of 400%⋅min or higher. The duration of surgery had no clinically important persistent effect on intraoperative PPV or any other sublingual microcirculation variable.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a rise in MG-CLS episodes and increased mortality. We aimed to explore the association between MG-CLS and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted a multicenter retrospective observational study involving MG-CLS patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality according to whether SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a trigger.ResultsThe study included 84 patients (44% women) with a median age of 55 years [IQR 46–62], accounting for 127 ICU admissions. Most patients (88%) had monoclonal gammopathy, predominantly with an IgG heavy chain (98%). A trigger was identified in 63% of cases, primarily suspected or confirmed viral infections, including 26 episodes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within 28 days of ICU admission, 32% of patients died. Episodes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a higher need for mechanical ventilation (69% vs. 38%, p = 0.004), renal replacement therapy (54% vs. 31%, p = 0.03), and increased 28-day mortality (42% vs. 17%, p = 0.005).

While artificial intelligence (AI)-based objective Automatic Pain Assessment (APA) systems are a promising solution, their clinical implementation raises essential questions, primarily regarding clinician acceptance.MethodsWe conducted a survey-to-consensus investigation on the feasibility and application of APA for clinical use. Firstly, the steering committee implemented the CHERRIES guidelines and designed a questionnaire for healthcare professionals. Given the survey results, 26 experts in pain medicine were asked to participate in a two-round consensus by rating 10 statements through a 7-point Likert scale. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% agreement (“agree” or “completely agree”). For both phases, data was collected through online questionnaires and analyzed quantitatively.ResultsFor the survey, we collected responses from 628 healthcare professionals. The output highlighted excellent acceptance of the technology and a preference for multidimensional techniques. After two rounds, consensus was achieved on 8 out of 10 statements. Experts agreed on APA utility in supporting healthcare professionals and real-time pain monitoring. A strong consensus (96.2%) supported the need to inform patients about the use and limitations of AI systems. Adequate staff training is mandatory. Moreover, 92.3% agreed on the importance of implementing risk management, data quality control, and AI governance throughout the APA lifecycle. The experts stressed the need for internal and external validation processes and periodic updates, even for research purposes. Consensus was also reached about the importance of involving interdisciplinary stakeholders and addressing regulatory, ethical, and social implications. Multimodal inputs (e.g., physiological signals, facial expressions, speech, and clinical data) in APA systems are recommended. Additionally, APA systems should be capable of grading pain levels (e.g., via NRS), not just detecting the presence of pain. On the other hand, two statements did not reach consensus: the applicability of APA systems for acute and chronic pain conditions and their potential to improve therapeutic strategies.ConclusionAPA is viewed as a promising and potentially feasible technology for clinical pain assessment, particularly in vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to validate the dedicated tools, define applications in different clinical conditions (e.g., acute and chronic pain), and demonstrate their impact on routine clinical practice for pain management.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","29","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All individuals with reactive tests were successfully linked to care. Syphilis testing had a lower uptake (76.7%) and identified a positivity rate of 0.7%. Significant demographic and behavioral differences were found: previously tested participants are more likely to be older (p < 0.001, OR = 1.15) than first-time testers, more likely to be MSM (Men who have Sex with Men) than MSF (Men who have Sex with Female) and FSM (Female who has Sex with Male) (p < 0.001, OR = 0.132; p < 0.001, OR = 0.183); and are more likely to have had a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)(p = 0.003, OR = 0.128). Immediate HIV diagnosis and access to antiviral therapy reduce healthcare costs by €3,841 per patient, with total savings of €23,808 due to lower treatment expenses before immunodeficiency onset.ConclusionsCBVCT programs in Turin demonstrated high feasibility and effectiveness in engaging the target population and ensuring linkage to care. However, syphilis testing requires greater integration. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address disparities in testing behaviors and reinforce the economic sustainability of early HIV diagnosis and treatment.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","820","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to their invasiveness, traditional blood sampling methods present challenges in sports settings. The study investigated sex-specific metabolic responses, addressing a significant gap in exercise research, where female participation remains underrepresented. METHODS: To address this, we explored volumetrically accurate microsampling as a dried blood spot (DBS) technique for assessing metabolomic changes in response to acute exercise in more than 130 participants. This study employed a targeted quantitative approach using isotopically labeled internal standards to measure over 100 metabolites with DBS, providing accurate and traceable results. An accuracy assessment using standard reference material and stability testing over 90 days further evaluated the suitability of DBS for sports metabolomics. RESULTS: Our findings confirm that DBS offers a valid approach to capture metabolic changes during exercise, with 11 compounds within the confidence interval of the reference material and 59 compounds overlapping with database values. A wide panel of metabolites showed significant changes in differences of absolute concentrations upon bout exercise, with succinate and xanthine being the most significant compounds. Metabolites from the underexplored class of pyrimidines also showed significant changes. CONCLUSION: While metabolic regulations upon exercise are similar in both sexes, differences in the correlation with fitness-related metadata, such as peak volitional oxygen consumption and performance, indicate a higher complexity in women and a limitation of previous knowledge to men only. The quantification approach together with the simplicity of the sampling paves the way to expand this type of research toward other fields of personalized medical services.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","101065","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital health technologies (DHTs) present a promising opportunity to address these inequities and advance health equity. Despite this potential, a comprehensive and structured overview of existing frameworks and guidelines on advancing health equity and a clear understanding of the potential of DHTs in their implementation to systematically close the healthcare gap is yet to be done. OBJECTIVE: To this end, our objectives are twofold: first, to identify frameworks and guidelines that promote health equity and second, to pinpoint the role of DHTs as an avenue for their implementation. We conducted a scoping review informed by Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework, methodological guidelines by the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: A comprehensive search was conducted across seven databases on 6 December 2023: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and WISO. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included primary and secondary studies published in English between 2010 and 2023 focusing on advancing health equity for priority populations. CHARTING METHODS: For the analysis, we applied multistaged coding approaches to answer our twofold objective. RESULTS: The search identified 6419 studies, of which 38 met our final inclusion criteria and were included in this review. We extracted 559 recommendations on advancing health equity and synthesised these into 82 distinct recommendations across five levels of initiative and 19 areas of initiative. Thereby, 24% of the included studies explicitly mentioned the use of (digital) technology with 10 impact opportunities on advancing health equity. CONCLUSION: Our synthesis offers key insights into the advancement of health equity across different levels of initiative and the role of DHTs in their implementation. This offers practitioners and researchers alike a comprehensive overview to make health equity advancement more tangible and actionable.

We identified two core thematic clusters: one related to sustainable food practices (ecology/sustainability, regionality, seasonality, from-farm-to-table, and vegetarianism/veganism) and the other to experiential dimensions of dining (experience, topic-based concept, and storytelling). Our findings contribute to the academic discussion on culinary futures and provide grounded insights into how fine dining is likely to evolve in response to broader societal, environmental, and cultural shifts.

However, clinical implementation is limited by long acquisition times, changing conditions between imaging and surgery, and lack of correlation with standard techniques. PURPOSE: To extend a methodology for multimodal data analysis to relaxometry data. To integrate relaxometry into the burr hole needle biopsy procedure with optical guidance, setup a workflow for multimodal data processing and analysis, and apply the methodology in a clinical setting. METHODS: Multi-dimensional multi-echo relaxometry data (2x6 min) was acquired in addition to the clinical imaging protocol. Relaxation rate and proton density maps, as well as their differences were calculated before (R1, R2) and after gadolinium contrast-agent administration (R1Gd, R2Gd). Radiological volumes of interest (VOIs: tumor, edema, white matter, and biopsy) were defined on clinical images. Rate distribution changes were analyzed on three levels: the biopsied volume, along the needle trajectory (4x4x4 mm3 volumes), and VOIs. Increased R1Gd and R2Gd were compared to indications from 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence and detailed neuropathological evaluation. RESULTS: Neuropathological analysis confirmed seven glioblastoma, one lymphoma, and one non-tumorous diagnosis. Increased R1Gd was found in all biopsied volumes, although tumorous volumes presented larger R1Gd increase (3-9 times) compared to volumes dominated by necrotic or non-tumorous tissue. Along the trajectory, increased R1Gd and R2Gd were not tumor-specific, however, the greatest R1Gd shifts were found in or adjacent to radiologically defined tumorous tissue. Increased relaxation rates corresponded to 82% and 45% (R1Gd: φ = 0.35, R2Gd: φ = 0.27) of fluorescence peaks. In the radiological VOIs, increased R1Gd and R2Gd were found in tumorous tissue, a slight right shift in edematous tissue, and negligible changes in white matter. CONCLUSION: Combined analysis suggests increased R1Gd together with fluorescence peaks as a marker for tumor tissue. The presented multimodal approach provides a workflow toward clinical translation of relaxometry.","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","e0326765","","7","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key barrier to developing effective dietary interventions for T2D management is the wide inter-individual variation in glycemic and behavioral responses, which limits the impact of one-size-fits-all recommendations. To enable personalized dietary prompts for glycemic control, it is critical to first predict an individual’s susceptibility to elevated postprandial (PPG) levels—or state of momentary vulnerability to PPG excursions. We examined the feasibility of personalized models to predict PPG excursions,and their associated vulnerability states, in the daily lives of 67 Chinese adults with T2D (Mage = 61.39; median = 63.00; 35 women; 2,463 glucose observations). We developed machine learning models trained on past individual observations to predict the next-in-time PPG excursion, using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data or CGM data combined with manually-logged meals and glucose-lowering agent intake. On average, personalized models predicted PPG excursions (F1-score: M = 75.88%; median = 78.26%), with substantial variation in predictability across individuals. Notably, no two individuals shared the same dietary and temporal predictors of PPG excursions. This study is the first to predict individual vulnerability states to glucose responses among adults with T2D in China. Findings can help personalize just-in-time adaptive interventions by tailoring dietary prompts based on individuals’ unique vulnerability states to PPG excursions. This approach can inform the development of digital dietary interventions in mHealth apps and clinical decision support tools, thereby helping optimize glycemic control and patient-centered T2D lifestyle management..","2025","2025-07-26 09:59:13","2025-07-26 09:59:13","","25920","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, universities report financing as being the main impediment to successful university spin-off companies (USOs) creation, leaving valuable inventions un-commercialized. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model in order to explain financing challenges experienced by USOs. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a conceptual model illustrating financing challenges met by USOs, and provides an explanation why TTOs report that obtaining financing is their biggest impediment to spin-off creation. Two different theoretical perspectives back this conceptual development: Knightian uncertainty and agency theory. Findings – This theoretical examination suggests that increasing levels of uncertainty affect the investor's willingness to fund new companies in a negative way. Through the literature review, clear indications were also found for the increased uncertainty with which USOs are faced. It is therefore natural to conclude that investors are more reluctant to invest in USOs because of the level of uncertainty compared with other entrepreneurial companies. Research limitations/implications – This study made a generalization of USOs as a homogeneous group of companies, which is an oversimplification. Further research should address how different business models, types of resources and their institutional link affect USOs' capital requirements and their problems in raising the required capital. Originality/value – The main contribution from this paper is the combination of theoretical insights from the concepts of Knightian uncertainty and agency theory.

During the last two decades, academic spin-offs have received increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners, mainly due to their ability to advance industrial application of scientific knowledge. Much of the studies available in literature on this matter, however, have focused on USA’s spin-offs, while still little attention has been paid to the European countries, and to Italy in particular. Thus, the aim of our research is twofold: first, to fill this gap in literature. Second, to propose, on the basis of the above mentioned literature review, a model of ex-ante evaluation of the spin-off companies’ performance. Specifically, the research methodology followed was a combination of literature analysis and Delphi technique: we first extensively reviewed the extant literature on spin-off companies, then we proposed to a panel of expert the indicators that emerged from the literature as affecting the performance of academic spin-offs.","2013","2025-07-26 10:35:17","2025-07-26 10:35:17","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: JOTMI Research Group","","","","","Italy; University; Performance; Academic Spin-Offs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively analyze the body of literature resulting from 30 years of research in EO, and to answer the following questions: what are the major themes that have emerged? What areas are missing? What degree of convergence do we see in the field of EO, and what concepts/topics has the field converged around? Design/methodology/approach – A bibliometric study with a sample of 405 articles published from January 1987 to July 2014 was developed. Techniques of bibliometric, lexical, and content analysis were used. The analysis involved: the evolution of published articles; the main authors, their nationalities, and institutional affiliations; citation and co-citations analysis; the journals that have published the most articles; and the most frequently-searched topics. Opting for bibliometric techniques permit an analysis of a larger number of articles and a greater variety of articles than other methodologies such as meta-analyses and systematic review studies. Accordingly, a more comprehensive look at the field of EO can be taken. Findings – Two distinct but complementary classifications are proposed to characterize the body of the literature resulting from 30 years of research in EO. The first one demonstrates that the field presents a convergence of the themes in four axis which together comprise studies on EO: performance, strategy, entrepreneurial attitude, and management. The second one presents the frequency of occurrence of the themes in the field: high-frequency themes or classical themes, frequently in the literature; moderate-frequency themes or emerging issues have not been sufficiently explored; low-frequency themes or potential opportunities related to understudied issues and contexts less frequently surveyed. A future research agenda is proposed for emerging themes and specific contexts. Practical implications – The identification of key themes in the field of EO contributes to assess the research evolution in order to recognize emerging themes and contexts, and the research gaps. With this, it is possible to lead new studies to cover a lack of research and advance knowledge in the field. The themes most studied also show the contribution for EO to organizational practice, especially in relation to the impact on the performance, the stimulus to the development of innovations, and the effects on organizational growth. Additionally, the identification of the authors most cited, most productive on the theme and the identification of the core journals for publishing of the area is recommended as a general reference for researchers interested in the topic of EO. Social implications – Although EO literature has been widely developed in Anglo regions (especially in the USA and UK) and Germanic Europe (especially Spain), there are others lacking these studies, especially Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Middle East, with rare articles published internationally. The results can guide the advancement of research in these different contexts and realities where even issues more widely treated in the literature have been unexplored. The lack of studies in certain contexts can lead to new studies for inserting new insights into EO, such as potential differences between developed regions and in development. For regions where the studies on EO are more developed, the results of this paper contribute to signaling issues and contexts little explored that may be the focus of attention. Originality/value – The generation of literature indicators of EO through bibliometric fills a research gap on the theme, providing a more comprehensive view of the field and of the current status of the research on EO. Identifying the most frequent topics in EO literature, and little-explored themes and contexts makes it possible to propose an agenda for future research and knowledge generation on EO. Thus, it is suggested the development of studies focus on emerging themes like growth, learning, knowledge, resources, and capabilities; also in specific contexts with potential for aggregating new knowledges in the EO field such as family firms, non-profit organizations, social contexts, the public sector, university, spin-off, firms in emerging and developing economies.","2016","2025-07-26 10:35:17","2025-07-26 10:35:17","","","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","","","Entrepreneurship; Bibliometric Analysis; Entrepreneurial Orientation; Research On Entrepreneurial Orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this sense, universities play a crucial role in this mission, and university spin-offs have become one of the most popular mechanisms of academic knowledge transfer. The purpose of this paper is to perform a literature review in the field of university spin-offs. The adopted methodology starts by creating a conceptual map of the various research areas around university spin-offs, followed by the identification of the most predominant studies in the field taking into account the number of citations. The findings indicate that the main explored dimensions in the university spin-offs research include the process of technology transfer, the role of university in the society, the regional context of the university and the impact of university spin-offs considering several dimensions. On the other side the least explored dimensions include the analysis of the founders’ background, and the establishment of public policies to support the activities of university spin-offs.","2018-06","2025-07-26 10:35:18","2025-07-26 10:35:18","","","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Academy of Economic Studies","","","","","Technology Transfer; Knowledge Transfer; Academic Entrepreneurship; Activities; Entrepreneur University; University Spin-Offs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, given the nature of suchlike studies, it is difficult to reach a common understanding of the competencies. In fact, there is a need to provide some systematization to achieve advancements in the field. A review of 87 articles indexed on Scopus about technology entrepreneurs indicates that competencies of technology entrepreneurs can be classified under three groups of technological competencies, entrepreneurial competencies, and managerial competencies. This classification is used for two purposes, namely to categorize the technology entrepreneurs based on their competencies and to recommend new venues of research to study technology entrepreneurs. This paper can help technology entrepreneurs develop their competencies. It will also be useful in identifying entrepreneurs, and in training and developing the competency of academic entrepreneurs, technology incubators, and accelerators.","2019-04","2025-07-26 10:35:18","2025-07-26 10:35:18","","191-211","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: University of Tehran","","","","","Systematic Review; Start-Up; Competency Approach; Technology Entrepreneur; Typology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to investigate the articles published in the field of university entrepreneurship between 2000 and 2019 with a bibliometric approach. The research population included all scientific articles (Article and Review) in the area of university entrepreneurship indexed on Scopus. Results included the identification of mostly cited articles, authors, institutions, leading countries, and mostly used keywords in the field. After gathering information from Scopus, graphical maps of co-citation, bibliographic coupling and co-occurrence have been drawn using VOSViewer software. The results showed that the process of published researches in the area of university entrepreneurship has been ascending in recent years such that the largest number of papers was related to 2019. Among countries, the USA was the most productive country, although most of the productive countries were located in Europe. University of Ghent (Belgium) was the most productive institute and Journal of Technology Transfer had the highest number of published articles; and keywords of “academic entrepreneurship”, “entrepreneurial university”, “technology transfer”, “entrepreneurship”, “university spin-offs” and “innovation” were the most commonly used keywords in university entrepreneurship articles. Finally, thematic clustering of most commonly used keywords has been performed.","2020-12","2025-07-26 10:35:18","2025-07-26 10:35:18","","","","4","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","","Bibliometric; University Entrepreneurship; Bibliographic Couples; Citation Analysis; Co-Occurrence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, no conceptual framework can explain how the technology-market matching proceeds from one stage to another. A longitudinal survey design involving four focus groups was chosen to monitor the development process of group spin-off creation in context. Data collection is also derived from the literature review, in-depth interviews, and a series of workshops and focus group discussions on the Malaysian and Cambodian higher education sectors. Finding shows that the AE toolkit is organized around four mutually dependent themes: (1) the structure of an enterprising university and its culture, (2) university spin-offs (USOs) and applied research, (3) the attribute of academic entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial ecosystem, and (4) spin-off development and community engagements. These theories may offer a more comprehensive insight into the AE process in conjunction with each other. The beliefs of each notion hint at significant consequences for further research on AE and the world of work as a general rule.","2020","2025-07-26 10:35:19","2025-07-26 10:35:19","","","","1-2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Enviro Research Publishers","","","","","Development; Academic Entrepreneurship; Start-Ups; University Spin-Offs; Technology Transfer Office (TTO); Technology-Market Matching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), done to find out factors motivating faculty to be &lsquo;entrepreneurial'. Initially bibliometric analysis was done to understand the extent at which research is done on the topic. In all, 59 relevant articles (1995–2023) were selected for SLR. &lsquo;Entrepreneurial motivation' of faculty is considered to be a niche and less explored area of study due to which building strong propositions becomes a challenge. Majority of studies are of advanced and resource rich economies and applying those to resource constraint situation cannot be considered as an ideal situation. These research gaps are located by this article. Factors motivating faculties to get engaged in entrepreneurial activities were analysed. Existing research has classified motivational factors as intrinsic and extrinsic, in &lsquo;resource constraint' (push forces) and &lsquo;resource-rich' (pull forces) environment. The literature states that academicians tend to do explorative activities rather than commercialization related activities. This study has informed about various factors of entrepreneurial motivation which can be used for building instruments for measuring motivation of academic entrepreneurs. The study findings have a strong proposition for the need of empirical research on entrepreneurial motivation of faculty members which is the future scope of research.","2023-12","2025-07-26 10:35:19","2025-07-26 10:35:19","","191-210","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE India","","","","","Motivation; Entrepreneurial; Academic Entrepreneur; Faculty Engagement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within knowledge management studies, a large amount of research has focused on family businesses, highlighting the particular needs they require. At the same time, several studies have highlighted the existence of barriers and enabling factors in the adoption of new technologies within family businesses. Currently, we are seeing the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) within business organizations. On these premises, this study has a dual objective. The first objective, from a theoretical point of view, wants to trace the link between AI and knowledge management. The second objective of this study aims to identify the main barriers to the application of AI in family businesses. This study is based on a systematic literature review using the phases of data collection, bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Two international scientific databases were used: Scopus and Web of Science (Clarivate). A search string was created by identifying keywords. Subsequently, only scientific documents published in double blind review journals, in English, were selected. The sample used in this study contained about 40 scientific documents. The results of this study offer initial reflections on the adoption of artificial intelligence in family businesses. Artificial intelligence represents a new way of managing knowledge within organizations. The peculiar characteristics of family businesses impose reflections on the methods of adoption and barriers that may emerge. This study contributes to the understanding of family businesses, under the theoretical perspective of knowledge management. Family businesses represent complex but widespread organizations. For this reason, academics, entrepreneurs and practitioners must understand the obstacles that could make the adoption of AI difficult.","2024","2025-07-26 10:35:19","2025-07-26 10:35:19","","","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Academic Conferences International Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LYBWXX5Q","journalArticle","2025","Maha, Aly; M, Grimm Heike; David, Audretsch","Impact of Cultural Values and Practices on Entrepreneurial Behavior: Bibliometric Literature Review","Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy","","2045-211X","10.1108/jepp-08-2024-0131","","PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to offer a first review of the literature focusing on cultural characteristics and values that impact on entrepreneurial behavior and activities to gain a first-hand overview of the state of the art in this field of research. In the following section, some of the most important concepts, theories and empirical papers are drawn from the existing research to frame and shape the literature review. In particular, section two identifies some of the most compelling factors influencing entrepreneurship behavior, including entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, national institutions, entrepreneur-specific characteristics, contextual characteristics and national culture. These six underlying factors are generally viewed in the literature to explain why and how behavior varies across entrepreneurs.Design/methodology/approachThe methodology involves bibliometric analysis of the scholarly literature on entrepreneurial behavior more generally, and in particular, the role of culture. Studies listed in the Web of Science since 2000 are scanned, which generated 1,520 articles with the theme of entrepreneurial behavior. Using standard and widely accepted bibliometric techniques, a careful inspection of the original search is reduced to 582 articles. The particular inclusion criteria are carefully discussed and documented in this section, along with the keywords utilized in the search algorithm.FindingsBy systematically assessing the extant literature review, findings and methods of the top 25 cited articles in the field are presented so as to identify content, methodology, direction of the literature and the opportunities for future research. An important finding is the preponderance of quantitative studies and the lack of qualitative studies in this field. Therefore, the conclusion emphasizes the need for future research with a variety of methodological approaches to how national cultural settings impact entrepreneurial behavior. Such new studies can be useful for understanding entrepreneurship and how governments can tailor entrepreneurial programs that fit the country’s context.Research limitations/implications The qualification involves the key phrases and words employed in the bibliometric algorithm to undertake the search and identify the relevant literature. In fact, the entrepreneurship research field is a relatively young field (Acs and Audretsch, 2006). The time period: Given that some of the most important scholars and journals addressed the topic before the new century, there is no doubt that important research was published prior to the year 2000. However, we focused on the current century due to the sudden increase of research in this topic that occurred in 2015. The restriction to the English languages in implementing the bibliometric algorithm: Such an obstacle is common in bibliometric searches, due to the different spelling used in keywords. However, this bibliometric search run could successfully identify the different spellings of the word “behavior” and “behaviour”.Originality/valueThis paper fills a research gap by addressing an emerging research area that has been receiving increasing attention recently due to the growing demand for understanding the differences of entrepreneurial responses and behaviors in national cultural settings. Presently, very few systematic reviews of literature exist that specifically cover the impact of national cultural practices, characteristics and values on entrepreneurial behavior. The paper introduces a bibliometric review of literature of refereed published articles in the field of entrepreneurship behavior from 2000 until 2021, with a focus on publications that include the keywords “local/national culture/cultural characteristics/cultural values influence on entrepreneurial behavior” in their title or abstract. The paper shows that the number of publications has been rising within the last few years, indicating the growth of interest in the field of cultural impact on entrepreneurship and specifically, entrepreneurial cognition, intention and behaviors.","2025","2025-07-26 10:35:20","2025-07-26 10:35:20","","","","","Early-Online","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
