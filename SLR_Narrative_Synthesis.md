# Narrative Synthesis (2010–2025): Academic Intrapreneurship in Higher Education

## Scope & Approach
This synthesis integrates findings from **16 peer‑reviewed studies (2010–2025)** included in your PRISMA flow. We define **academic intrapreneurship** as *opportunity creation and innovation pursued **within** higher‑education institutions (HEIs) by academics and professional staff, using internal resources, governance, and legitimacy*, and distinguish it from **academic entrepreneurship** (external venture creation/spinouts). Methods across the corpus span **bibliometric mapping, surveys, interviews, case studies, mixed methods**, and conceptual framing. Evidence is global; **India/Maharashtra mentions are limited**, underscoring the need for your subsequent fieldwork.

## Conceptual Clarity
Across studies, intrapreneurship is framed along two complementary lenses:
1) **Actor‑centric** (faculty/staff capability and motivation): intrapreneurial **orientation**, **psychological capital**, identity work, role conflict and perceived support.
2) **Institutional/organizational** (the “intrapreneurial university”): strategy, governance, **incubators**, incentives/KPIs, IP policies, and support infrastructure.

A practical boundary rule for your SLR is to treat **internal opportunity development** (new programs, labs, services, platforms, curricula, tech‑transfer processes) as *intrapreneurship*, while **external new firms** are *entrepreneurship*. Papers that blend the two are included but weighted lower in relevance.

## Antecedents (What enables intrapreneurship?)
**Individual level**  
- **Intrapreneurial orientation** among faculty is consistently tied to higher engagement with internal innovation (e.g., Abidi et al.).  
- **Psychological capital and role conflict** matter: a China‑based study (fpsyg-13-793408)—though focused on *entrepreneurial* intent—shows **PsyCap ↑ intent**, while **role conflict dampens it**. By analogy, similar dynamics likely influence *intra* intent inside HEIs.  
- **Identity & logics navigation**: the institutional‑logics paper depicts academics negotiating research/teaching vs. innovation/public‑value logics via **bridging** (aligning with HEI mission) and **buffering** (carving protected space).

**Organizational level**  
- **Incubators as boundary spanners** (Contents lists available at ScienceDirect): provide coaching, IP/legal help, industry links, and **internal legitimacy**, converting bottom‑up ideas into institution‑backed projects.  
- **Governance & incentives** (intrapreneurial universities in digital times): clear **intrapreneurship KPIs**, internal seed‑funds, time‑allocation, and promotion/recognition criteria catalyze project uptake; digital infrastructures reduce coordination costs.  
- **Culture & climate** (Creating reluctant academic intrapreneurs? A literature review TERG Policy): ambiguous mandates and risk‑averse climates create “reluctant intrapreneurs” who innovate despite perceived penalties.

**Environmental/institutional level**  
- Third‑mission policies, rankings, and regional innovation systems legitimize HEI‑internal innovation; **bibliometric evidence** (bibliographic mapping study) shows rising use of “intrapreneur*” terms post‑2015 within HE contexts.

## Mechanisms (How does it happen inside HEIs?)
- **Resource orchestration via incubators**: scouting ideas → mentoring → IP screening → cross‑unit brokering → institutional sponsorship.  
- **Programmatic pathways**: internal calls/seed‑grants, living labs, challenge funds, curricular pilots, and staff‑led service/process redesign.  
- **Cross‑boundary teaming**: faculty–student–industry teams; administrative champions who “translate” intrapreneurial value into HEI priorities.  
- **Logics navigation**: *bridging* (reframing projects as core to teaching/research quality or societal impact) and *buffering* (dedicated time, spaces, or sandboxes).  
- **Digital affordances**: platforms for collaboration and rapid prototyping scale participation.

## Outcomes (What does intrapreneurship produce?)
- **Innovation outputs**: new academic programs, micro‑credentials, research platforms, interdisciplinary centers, process innovations in student services and tech‑transfer; occasionally patents/licensing when projects mature.  
- **Capability outcomes**: faculty/staff skill development, stronger industry ties, and student experiential learning; several studies (e.g., Contents lists available at ScienceDirect) link internal innovation to **student engagement** and employability narratives.  
- **Cultural/strategic outcomes**: movement toward the **intrapreneurial university**, where internal venturing becomes routinized and measured.

## Barriers & Frictions
- **Bureaucracy and risk aversion**, opaque IP/process rules, **misaligned incentives** (promotion criteria privileging publications/teaching loads), and **time scarcity**.  
- **Role overload/conflict** (echoed in fpsyg-13-793408), **coordination costs**, and **siloed decision rights**.  
- **Equity concerns**: work on disparities (e.g., gender‑related barriers) signals differential access to intrapreneurial opportunities and sponsorship.  
- **Conceptual drift**: many HEI studies conflate *entrepreneurship* with *intrapreneurship*, complicating measurement and benchmarking.

## Points of Contrast (from user‑selected items)
- **Liao et al., 2022** (row 13): *Key constructs*—**psychological capital**, **role conflict**—predict *entrepreneurial* intentions. *Takeaway for intra*: build PsyCap and reduce role conflict (clarify workload/time, explicit intrapreneurship KPIs).  
- **2018 review** (row 14): maps **entrepreneurial university** mechanisms. *Takeaway for intra*: retain internal‑innovation focus; use the review’s governance/incentive taxonomy but adapt measures to internal (non‑spinout) outcomes.

## Gaps & Future Research Agenda (to inform your Maharashtra thesis)
1) **Operational definition & metrics**: Develop and validate an **Academic Intrapreneurship Index** combining *intent/behavior* (e.g., intrapreneurial orientation, PsyCap, role conflict), *supports* (incubator access, seed‑funds, policy clarity), and *outputs* (new programs/services, process innovations, internal IP events).  
2) **Discipline heterogeneity**: Test differences across **Management, Engineering, Medicine & Health care, Hospitality, Agriculture** (resources, risk norms, external ties).  
3) **Governance levers**: Causal identification of **incentive designs** (e.g., course‑release, internal grants, recognition in promotions).  
4) **Equity & participation**: Who becomes an intrapreneur? Examine **gender, rank, contract type**, and **access to sponsors**.  
5) **India/Maharashtra context**: Map HEI policies, incubator maturity, and regional industry clusters; compare state/private/autonomous HEIs.  
6) **Longitudinal evidence**: Track project lifecycles (idea → sponsorship → scaling → institutionalization).

## Suggested Study Design for Maharashtra
- **Design**: Mixed‑methods, **explanatory sequential**.  
  - **Quantitative**: Multi‑HEI survey (faculty & professional staff) using validated scales—*intrapreneurial orientation*, **PsyCap**, **role conflict/overload**, perceived **support & climate**, **incubator access**, **governance clarity**, plus outputs (% time on internal innovation; count of proposals/pilots). Use **PLS‑SEM** to model antecedents → mechanisms → outcomes; stratify by discipline and HEI type.  
  - **Qualitative**: 12–16 **case studies** (incubator‑led and department‑led initiatives), semi‑structured interviews with **intrapreneurs, sponsors, and administrators**; process tracing of 2–3 projects per site.  
- **Sampling**: State universities, autonomous colleges, and private HEIs across **Maharashtra**; ensure representation of the five disciplines.  
- **Key hypotheses**:  
  - H1: **PsyCap** and **intrapreneurial orientation** ↑ internal innovation behavior; **role conflict** ↓ it.  
  - H2: **Governance clarity + incentives** mediate the link between individual antecedents and outcomes.  
  - H3: **Incubator access** moderates effects (stronger where boundary‑spanning support exists).  
  - H4: Effects vary by **discipline** and **HEI type**.  
- **Outcome measures**: # of internal proposals/pilots/year; # of new programs/services; process improvements; internal IP events; student engagement metrics; satisfaction with support.  
- **Quality & bias**: Pre‑register instruments; triangulate survey, admin data, and case evidence; include non‑response analysis.

## PRISMA Reporting Notes
- Provide the **evidence table** (attached) plus a brief **risk‑of‑bias appraisal** (method transparency, sampling, construct clarity).  
- Clearly separate **intrapreneurship** vs **entrepreneurship** in inclusion rationale.  
- Report the **time window (2010–2025)**, databases/sources used, screening steps, and reasons for exclusion at full‑text stage (e.g., entrepreneurship‑only focus).

**One‑paragraph abstract (for the 6‑page paper):**  
This PRISMA‑guided SLR (2010–2025) synthesizes 16 studies on **academic intrapreneurship** in higher‑education institutions. Evidence converges on individual antecedents (**intrapreneurial orientation, psychological capital**) interacting with organizational enablers (**incubators, governance clarity, incentives, digital infrastructures**) under multiple **institutional logics**. Mechanisms include boundary‑spanning incubation, programmatic seed‑funds, cross‑boundary teaming, and logics‑navigation (bridging/buffering). Outcomes span internal program/service innovations, capability building, and cultural shifts toward the **intrapreneurial university**. Barriers include bureaucracy, misaligned incentives, role conflict, and equity gaps. The review clarifies definitional drift with academic entrepreneurship and outlines a **Maharashtra‑focused mixed‑methods agenda** with discipline‑stratified hypotheses and measurable intrapreneurial outputs.
